Most patients with severe COVID-19 develop pneumonia in the first week of the disease. As the infection progresses, the infiltration increases, and the affected areas increases. Excessive and uncontrolled immune system response with rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm plays the main role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAccording to available data, exosomes can regulate inflammation and regenerative processes due to the change in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and switch the immune cell to regenerative secretome. Inhalation of exosomes may reduce inflammation and damage to the lung tissue and stimulate the regenerative processes.\n\nThis protocol has been developed based on the literature, information about the ongoing tests NCT04276987 (A Pilot Clinical Study on Inhalation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exosomes Treating Severe Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia) and NCT04384445 (Organicell Flow for Patients With COVID-19), Patent No 271036826 of 2019. \"A method for obtaining and concentrating microRNA-containing exosomal multi-potent mesenchymal-stromal cells for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products to stimulate regenerative processes and slow down aging.",

Mechanisms of these changes are multifactorial and are not completely elucidated. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) might be one of the mechanisms. On molecular level role of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has been recognized. Recently, mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone has been proposed as a possible direct contributor to the progression of renal injury and fibrosis, beside his well known role as a regulator of extracellular fluid volume and sodium and potassium balance. In this study the investigators will determine the impact of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use on progression of chronic scores in transplanted kidney over one year.

            "Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mediated by stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) which leads to donor T-lymphocytes activation and target tissue destruction, particularly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver in acute setting. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.\n\nObjective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics\u00ae umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.\n\nStudy design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.\n\nFor Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20 patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.\n\nCyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires.",

            "Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease that causes joint pain, stiffness, and movement limitation. Nearly 50% in those 75 years and above are affected. In Taiwan, the reported prevalence was more than 6000 per year. The cause of pain is joint instability and structure changed, including hyaline articular cartilage lost, bony remodeling, capsular stretching and periartcular muscle weakness. Current guidelines for treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis include exercise, anti-inflammatory drugs, transcutaneous electrical stimulation(TENS) and magnetic fields(MF) which reduce pain and improve the patient's quality of life.\n\nHowever, conservative therapies and oral supplements have been evaluated but are without clear efficacy. Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. One of the hypotheses is stimulating local healing and current study demonstrated clinical benefit for pain and improvement of function. The effects of multi-point injections were more pronounced in several studies than single-point injection.\n\nExtracorporeal shock wave is common treatment for kidney stones, has been widely used in soft tissue diseases, such as calcified tendon lesions and plantar fasciitis. The theory of extracorporeal shock wave is energy of high-frequency vibration caused destruction of stones and other hard material and by increasing the rate of vascular regeneration in the injured area and increasing the rate of autologous tissue repair, possible biological processes include increased mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation, slowing the inflammatory response and antimicrobial efficacy. Current studies have shown equivalent clinical outcomes on calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy among extracorporeal shock wave therapy, sono-guided acupuncture and arthroscopic surgery and the extracorporeal shock wave has the advantage of non-invasive treatment.\n\nTaking the advantages of non-invasive treatment of extracorporeal shockwave. We want to design a randomized control trial by multi-point shockwave therapy and physical therapy compared with placebo shockwave therapy and physical therapy. Two randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported improvement in outcomes in response to shockwave therapy but were not methodologically rigorous. The investigators therefore conducted a two-arm RCT to assess the hypothesis that adults with symptomatic knee pain receiving shockwave therapy will report greater improvement in knee-related quality-of-life than sham shockwave therapy.",

However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with permanent end ileostomy.

            "The immune system of a patient can attack the liver or the kidney received from a donor (organ rejection). This can be prevented by treating these patients long-life with immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs lead to numerous side effects and fail to prevent the rejection occurring months later after the transplantation (chronic rejection). Recently, it has been shown that a particular type of cells present in the bone marrow, namely Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), when injected to a patient, suppress its immune system and increase success rates of blood cells transplantation. This outcome opens doors to investigate the potential of these cells to provide a valuable tool for improving solid organ transplantation without the need of high concentration of immunosuppressive drugs. The present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of MSC administration after liver or kidney transplantation.",

            "Ischemic heart disease is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in the Western world and is a public health problem. Among ischemic heart diseases, myocardial infarction has specific significance because the cardiac muscle does not have sufficient and adequate capacity to regenerate; therefore, necrosis of a region leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. Infarction can lead to a progressive and irreversible decrease in cardiac function, resulting in heart failure (HF) syndrome, depending on the area affected by this scar, via a ventricular remodeling mechanism.\n\nIn recent years, HF has been revealed as a major public health problem due to its incidence and its social, economic and especially human impact, as it represents a serious limitation of the quality of life of individuals. The prevalence of HF in the general population of the United States and the United Kingdom is approximately 1%, and in those older than 75 years, the prevalence varies between 5 and 10%. Regarding its prognosis, recent data from the Framingham Study indicate that at 5 years, the mortality rate of HF is 75% in men and 62% in women; the mean mortality rate of all cancers is 50%.\n\nThe molecular basis of congestive HF is the absence of cardiac cells capable of regenerating the heart muscle. Despite the publication of recent studies suggesting the existence of stem cells capable of regenerating cardiomyocytes destroyed because of myocardial infarction, in humans, the capacity of these cells is insufficient to replace the cells destroyed due to necrosis secondary to ischemia.\n\nIn recent years, the accumulation of results derived from preclinical studies has allowed the development of the first clinical trials of the feasibility and safety of cardiac regeneration using cellular therapy. Several studies have shown that t cells exist in adult bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and, more recently, multipotent stem cells (MAPC), with the ability to differentiate into endothelial tissue and cardiac muscle, which can contribute to the regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function in animal infarction models. However, cell therapy research has moved rapidly toward the use of more undifferentiated cells rather than hematopoietic lineages, such as mesenchymal cells. These cells can be obtained from different sources, with a tendency toward the use of characterized allogeneic cells, which are immediately available in the potential recipient. Given that this type of therapy has not been rigorously investigated in Latin America, we aim to determine the effect of therapy using Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells (WJ-MSCs) from the human umbilical cord on neomyogenesis in patients with previous myocardial infarction who are undergoing open revascularization. Our hospital has some experience with regenerative therapy, both in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic infarction, with encouraging results that support this new phase of inter-institutional research.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the safety and estimate the effect of coronary revascularization accompanied by intramyocardial injection of WJ-MSCs and the placement of an extracellular matrix patch seeded with WJ-MSCs compared to coronary revascularization accompanied by injection of culture medium without the presence of WJ-MSC and placement of an extracellular matrix patch without seeding with WJ-MSC on global and regional cardiac function, myocardial viability and the incidence of adverse effects determined as ventricular arrhythmias.",

            "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nNon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.",

It is a medical condition of reduced function in older adults which is associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes such as falls, disability, admission to hospital, or need for long-term care. Currently, there is no specific medical treatment of frailty. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are undifferentiated cells that self-replicated, and some may change into a particular cell type. These cells go to areas of injury due to signals released by injured cells. Upon reaching, the target tissue, MSCs repair injury by releasing growth factors and immune modulators to assist in the body's repair process.

There are several therapies currently available but these are often disappointing, as the great complexity of vocal fold microstructure hinders the development of effective therapy. Thus, identification of innovative strategies able to improve vibrational mechanical properties of vocal folds remains an important clinical challenge.\n\nAutologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) is recognized as an easily accessible source of cells displaying angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. Recent experimental and clinical reports also supported the anti-fibrotic potential of ADVSF, mainly attributed to the mesenchymal stem/stromal cell subset.\n\nSafety in humans has already been confirmed in several studies, including our previous clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT0262246; EudraCT number: 2015-000238-31). The main objective of this phase I/II trial was to measure for the first time the safety and tolerability of autologous ADSVF local injections in patients with scarred vocal folds. No severe adverse events occurred: only some minor adverse events were reported. Moreover, Voice Handicap Index was improved in all patients with a mean improvement from baseline of 40.1/120 and seven patients were considered as responders, defined as an improvement \u2265 18 points.\n\nBased on these observations, we hypothesized that the injection of autologous ADSVF could reduce the process of fibrosis, improve vibration and then dysphonia and quality of life in patients with scarred vocal folds.\n\nIn the absence of a reference treatment, the effectiveness of the ADSVF will be compared to a placebo: the local injection of excipients solution.\n\nThis study will test efficacy of the autologous ADSVF to treat vocal folds scarring. It is a randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical trial conducted according to a 2-treatment parallel design, with medico-surgical and scientific collaboration.\n\nRecruitment and follow-up of patients will be done in 4 university hospitals by the respective ENT teams (Marseille, Toulouse, Nice and Montpellier): 36 patients will be recruited and treated on a 24 months period.\n\nAt inclusion, 36 patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into two groups: ADSVF group and placebo group. Adipose tissue removal, ADSVF production and injection of ADSVF or placebo will be done on the same day during a short hospital stay. Patients will be followed and evaluated at 1 and 6 months with self-evaluation (Voice Handicap Index and a 10 points scale), video-laryngo-stroboscopic examination, vocal assessment with perceptive, acoustic and aerodynamic parameters and evaluation of adverse events. At the end of this 6-month follow-up (primary endpoint), patients without improvement will be offered an injection of thawed and washed ADSVF. Patients will continue to be followed in open-label on the same endpoints.",

This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past.

            "Articular cartilage defects in the knee have a poor intrinsic healing capacity and may lead to functional disability and osteoarthritis. Cartilage cell therapy using autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy medicinal product. Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly and extensive two-stage procedure which is limited by the number of chondrocytes obtained by biopsy and the dedifferentiation resulting from the expansion phase. Therefore, there is a need for improvement. A new cartilage repair technique should aim at decreasing surgical trauma, lowering complexity, improving logistics and cost-effectiveness while retaining or improving clinical outcome. Direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes in vitro showed improvement of the chondrogenic phenotype of dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. In addition, preserving the pericellular matrix of chondrocytes improves cartilage formation. These chondrons (chondrocytes with their pericellular matrix) have shown improved cartilage formation when combined with allogeneic MSCs in extensive preclinical studies. The cells are mixed with fibrin cell carrier and applied to the cartilage lesion within one surgical procedure. This will reduce patient morbidity and improve patient care through immediate transplantation of a potent cell-based cartilage product. This is a phase I/II prospective monocenter study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the IMPACT for treatment of focal articular cartilage lesions of the knee.",

            "Chronic wounds (CW) still represents a heavy burden to many patients and health care institution. Despite the most recent advances in wound management, up to 50% of chronic wounds still fail to heal. Conventional treatment of chronic wounds does not seem to work in several cases, consumes enormous amount of money and time, so it is necessary to develop different strategies. Previous studies have reported stem cells ability in tissue regenerations due mainly to its secreted paracrine factors, rather than its differentiation ability to become new cells. The factors is called secretomes, microvesicles, or exosomes, that can be found in the medium where the cells are growing, therefore it called conditioned medium (CM). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) such as Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells (WJ-MSC) appear to emerge as a promising wound healing therapy. To the best of investigator's knowledge, after conducted a pilot study using animal model to gain the preliminary data for the ulcer healing potential, this is the investigator's first clinical study to see the therapeutic potentials of Conditioned Medium Stem Cell as an additional growth factors in chronic skin ulcer healing and to compare the success of chronic ulcer healing in patients undergoing CM treatment and standard approach.

Based on this research, our clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN.",
            "Ano-perineal (or ano-rectal) fistulas are a frequent and major complication of Crohn's disease. Indeed, they indicate a greater severity of the disease. In addition, they have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Finally, these fistulas are difficult to cure, especially when they are complex. Indeed, medical treatment with anti-TNF drugs can only cure them in one third of cases. Various obturation treatments have been proposed in addition to medical treatment such as advancement flap, injection of biological glue, placement of a plug, intersphincter ligation of the fistulous path or laser but with still insufficient healing rates.\n\nThe injection of mesenchymal stem cells of adipose origin was first proposed for this indication in 2003. Since then, numerous studies have been published on the subject. Most importantly, an international multicenter randomized double-blind phase 3 controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of allogeneic stem cells over placebo with a therapeutic effect maintained at one year follow-up. The trial involved selected patients with Crohn's disease and one or more complex ano-perineal fistulas refractory to conventional treatments. This treatment has a high cost and its practical modalities are constraining (manufacturing, delivery, constrained time between the factory and the injection). However, this study is the first to have demonstrated in such a rigorous way the effectiveness of a local treatment on complex ano-perineal fistulas of Crohn's disease. These allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have therefore been granted marketing authorization in Europe and have been commercialized in several European countries including France during the summer of 2020 under the trade name ALOFISEL\u00ae. They are indicated for complex ano-perineal fistulas that have not responded to at least one conventional biological treatment, in the context of inactive or less active Crohn's disease.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to evaluate the rate of \"deep\" remission (i.e. clinical and radiological) at 12 months of follow-up in the first patients treated in France with ALOFISIEL\u00ae after its marketing. The evaluation is performed at 12 months because it seems that the result is consolidated after this period.",

            "Vitiligo is a complex disease causing a selective, often progressive, loss of functioning melanocytes from epidermal basal layer resulting in white patches on the skin and occasionally mucosae. Worldwide prevalence of vitiligo is around 1% whereas in India it is around 3-4% ranging from 0.46% to 8.8%.\n\nEtiopathogenesis of vitiligo is multifactorial consisting of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Environmental and genetic factors act in concert to destroy melanocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in vitiligo pathology,but the autoimmune pathogenesis has been proposed as one of the main causes of vitiligo.\n\nSurgical methods, mainly transplantation of non cultured epidermal cell suspension are effective treatment for stable vitiligo. Transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension and non-cultured dermal cell suspension in combination (a mode of cellular grafting technique) is a novel surgical method for the treatment of vitiligo. Cytotoxic CD8+ ( cluster of differentiation 8+) cells in vitiligo perilesions may dictate the fate of transplantation, and strategies against CD8+ T cell activation might be beneficial for patients undergoing melanocyte transplantation. Mesenchymal cells could inhibit T cell proliferation and induce T cell apoptosis. Bartsch first identified and characterized dermal mesenchymal cells (DMCs). They have a multi-lineage differentiation potential into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes.Vitiligo patients' autologous melanocytes transplantation efficiency may be predicted by perilesional skin-homing CD8+ T cell activities, and the immunoregulatory DMCs might be used as auxiliary agent to improve the efficacy.\n\nThis pilot study is planned to compare transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension v/s its combination with non-cultured dermal cell suspension as a novel method in vitiligo surgery in stability of vitiligo with regards to extent of repigmentation, color matching of repigmented area, patient satisfaction and adverse events if any.

            "Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or known as Covid-19 has recently become a global health emergency since it was first detected in Wuhan, the People Republic of China in December 2019. Since then, the prevalence has rapidly increased worldwide. In Indonesia, by the end of April 2020, around 10,000 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19 infection, with a case fatality rate of around 8%.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Covid-19 is still under investigation and to our understanding, ACE2 receptors in the alveoli serve as the binding site of the S-protein of envelope spike virus of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 enzyme aids the fusion between cell membrane and capsid of the virus, allowing penetration of virus into the cell. Vesicles containing virion fuse with cell membrane and released as new virions. Cytopathic effect of the virus and its ability to overcome immune response determines the degree of infection.\n\nDifferences in immunological profile among degrees of severity of Covid-19 may vary especially for the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia-inhibiting factors (LIF), immunological markers such as CXCR3+CD4+, CXCR3+CD8+ T cell and CXCR3+ NK cells, implying the ongoing cytokine storm. The previous studies also found increasing number for infection markers such as procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. The decreasing number of anti-inflammatory cytokines in such as IL-10 also supports this finding.\n\nPrevious studies have shown immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory capacity of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs contributed to the shifting of pro-inflammatory Th2 into anti-inflammatory Th2. One of the most recent study on the usage of MSCs on Covid-19 patients showed increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which give rise to inhibitory effect of T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell population. Vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is found increasing following MSCs administration, which indicates the ability to improve the disrupted capillaries due to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The ability of MSCs in differentiating to alveolar cells is proven by the presence of SPM and SPC2, surfactant proteins produced by type II alveolar cells. MSCs are unable to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 since they don't have ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 enzyme.",

            "The exact incidence of subepithelial tumors (SETs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is unknown, but the prevalence of gastric SETs detected during routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy is 0.36%. GI SETs may include leiomyoma, GI stromal tumor (GIST), schwannoma, lipoma, cyst, or ectopic pancreas. Surgical resection is the principal diagnostic and therapeutic method for SETs, especially for large and symptomatic ones. Preoperative pathological diagnosis of SETs may facilitate clinical decision making, but conventional endoscopic forceps biopsy does not yield adequate amounts of subepithelial tissue for definitive diagnosis.\n\nAlthough endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best imaging modality for the evaluation of SETs, it cannot substitute histopathological diagnosis. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may provide adequate amounts of tissue for the diagnosis of SETs, but it does not always afford adequate samples for immunohistochemical analysis because of the often small number of cells obtained by aspiration. Since some SETs, especially GI mesenchymal tumors such as GIST or schwannoma, have varied morphologic appearances, and diagnosis using a small biopsy is not straightforward, immunohistochemical analysis is strongly advisable, if not essential. EUS-guided Trucut biopsy (EUS-TNB) may overcome the limitations of EUS-FNA in procuring sufficient core tissue specimens. Although EUS-TNB is more accurate than EUS-FNA for diagnosing GI mesenchymal tumors, the rigidity of its 19-gauge (G) caliber and the mechanical friction of the firing mechanism produced by the torqued echoendoscope limit its use for SETs located in the gastric antrum and duodenum. Therefore, a needle facilitating adequate histological core sampling with easy maneuverability needs to be established. A 19G EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) device with ProCore reverse-bevel technology was recently introduced. A multicenter study revealed that histological samples could be successfully obtained using this needle in most patients having GI SETs, with a diagnostic accuracy of >80%.10 However, because of technical difficulties with this needle in the gastric antrum and duodenum, the same FNB device was recently developed in a 20 G platform with coiled sheath. This prospective, multicenter study aimed to evaluate feasibility, yield, and diagnostic accuracy of a newly developed 20 G ProCore needle with coiled sheath in patients with GI SETs.",

            "In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency, drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS.

            "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common hereditary retinal disorder (accounts for 20% of children attending blind schools in Pakistan) which causes degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. Rods and cones largely depend on the retinal pigment epithelium for their proper functioning. Various growth factors and their receptors are present in retinal epithelium and a number of genes are responsible for the production of these growth factors. Genetic mutation in any of these genes causes retinal degeneration by progressive loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. The disease initially starts with night blindness and leads to the loss of central vision and eventually total blindness. To date, there is no definitive cure for patients suffering from RP. Recently, stem cell based therapies have shown great promise for the management of RP. It is well documented that umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have the ability to release various paracrine and immunomodulatory factors that are similar to those synthesized by retinal pigment epithelium. Multiple routes including systemic (intravenous) and localized (subretinal, intravitreal, suprachoroidal and sub-tenon) have been employed to administer UMSCs for the management of RP. It is important to note that deep sub-tenon region (space between the sclera and the conjunctiva) acts as both natural culture medium for cells and as immune privileged site because of avascularity of the region. It has been reported that the injection of UMSCs in sub-tenon space of human subjects have improved the visual acuity even after 1 year post-injection. In addition, the injection of UMSCs in suprachoroidal space enhances the entry of growth factors released by the cells into choroidal flow and maintain the constant growth factors secretion to the choroidal and retinal tissues. Limoli and colleagues were the first to report the suprachoroidal administration of cells being the safe mode of cell delivery with no complications. The present study is aimed to investigate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of UMSC injection employing two different routes (sub-tenon injection versus suprachoroidal injection) for the treatment of RP in human subjects.",

In the next step, these primary cultures of CD34+ cells will treat with early-acting cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-4 to further induction into dendritic cells. Functional analysis of dendritic cells would be performed in this stage. In the second year of the project, we will further evaluate the induction of DCs by CD34+ stem cells could be affected by combination of mesenchymal stromal cells.

            "Whereas the pandemic due do Covid-19 continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients with a 30%-60% mortality rate for those requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. An additional advantage is that they can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. These cells have already been tested in several clinical trials with an excellent safety record.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be cell-treated while the remaining 20 patients will be injected with a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care.\n\nThe feasibility of the project is supported by the expertise of the Meary Cell and Gene Therapy Center, which is approved for the production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and has already successfully prepared the first batches of cells, as well as by the involvement of a cardiac surgery team which will leverage its experience with stem cells for the treatment of heart failure to make it relevant to the Stroma-Cov-2 project.",

Disease-related mortality is more than 3 million, representing 5% of all deaths, 90% of this mortality being concentrated in middle- and low-income countries. COPD can be subdivided into chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Emphysema, the focus of this project, is histologically defined by the permanent increase of the distal air spaces to the terminal bronchioles associated with the destruction of the alveolar septa in the lung. Approximately two-thirds of adult men and a quarter of women (most without dysfunction) will have well-defined emphysema, but often of limited extent.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, microbicide and repair potential. Regarding COPD, several authors have concentrated efforts in the investigation of the relationship between the severity of the condition and the various sources of adult stem cells. Apparently the lungs have a high chemotactic effect in relation to adult stem cells, since several studies have evidenced a high implantation (6-20%) of stem cells derived from bone marrow, administered systemically, in the pulmonary tissue of receptors. Therefore, MSCs has been tested in different lung diseases have no effective treatment, such as pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, COPD positive results, such as reduction of fibrosis, reduction of proliferation inflammatory cells and cytokines, reduction of infectious processes and recovery of the histological changes caused by pulmonary emphysema.\n\nBased on these findings, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic administration of bone marrow stem cells in patients with severe homogeneous emphysema and evaluating the feasibility, efficacy and safety of this procedure.",

Neuronal stem cells were shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.\n\nIn this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and restoration of neuronal function.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.\n\nSignificance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in general.",

These vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling, and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nThis clinical study will be performed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in healthy volunteers.",

            "Unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common finding especially in patients with lower limb malalignment and previous meniscectomy. Among the various treatment options, in recent years there has been an increasing attention towards the use of biologic agents, such as platelet rich plasma and mesenchymal stem cells, as intra-articular injective approaches to relieve pain and restore joint function. Anyway, the sole intra-articular administration of these agents may not lead to satisfactory outcome in a relevant percentage of patients. In fact, unicompartmental osteoarthritis is not only characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, but also by pathologic changes in the subchondral bone, both at the tibial plateaux and in the femoral condyle. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals, in many cases, alterations of the subchondral tissue known as \"bone marrow edema\", which is a sign of bone overload and play a significant role in the progression of unicompartmental OA and is responsible of OA-related symptoms. Therefore, concurrent treatment of both the subchondral bone damage and intra-articular degeneration could led to better outcome for patients affected by unicompartmental OA: the aim of the present pilot trial is to assess the safety and describe the clinical outcome following concurrent intra-articular and subchondral bone application of Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC). BMC is an autologous product rich in mesenchymal stem cells, which have immuno-modulatory and throfic properties and are able to restore the joint homeostasis by reducing the inflammatory distress traditionally associated to OA.\n\nBMC will be collected directly in the operating room from the anterior iliac crest or the tibia by using the MARROW CELLUTION kit (Geistlich, Switzerland), which allows to obtain BMC without the need of centrifugation processes. Approximately 9-10 ml of BMC will be harvested: 6 ml will be injected, under fluoroscopic guidance, in the tibial emiplateaux (approx 3 ml) and in the femoral condyle (approx 3 ml) presenting MRI evidence of bone marrow edema. The remaining amount of BMC will be administered intra-articularly to address articular tissues (cartilage, menisci and synovium). Twenty-five patients affected by unicompartmental knee OA will be included in the present pilot trial and treated in a \"Day-Surgery\" regimen. They will be followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months' after treatment by clinical questionnaires and radiographic evaluations (x-rays at 6 and 12 months, MRI at 12 months' f-up).

Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been found as a promising therapy for liver cirrhosis in adults. Bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation was also performed successfully for children with BA.

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response as indicated by the investigator's pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .\n\nObjective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.\n\nStudy design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.",

            "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.",

            "The ageing population and the increase in diabetes raise the prevalence of chronic skin ulcers (CCU). In diabetics, precursor cell mobilization decreases. In wounds, the inflammation is prolonged and oxidative stress increases. This is an unfavorable microenvironment for healing. A major risk factor in the development of CCU is nutritional deficiency.

Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use.

            "The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in the Western World, including Denmark. Cancer of the head and neck and its treatment often have a detrimental and lifelong impact on the quality of life of the patients. Radiotherapy is a key component for approximately 80% of all patients with head and neck cancer and despite the enormous improvement in ionizing radiotherapy, the radiation still leads to significant ionizing of healthy tissue, including the radiation-sensitive salivary glands. Salivary glands suffer severe damage from radiation, and as these cells are the principal sites of fluid secretion one of the most prevalent side effect of irradiation for head and neck cancer is hyposalivation and dry mouth syndrome, xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to debilitating oral disorders and major implication for the overall quality of life, including social life and professional life. Currently, only symptomatic treatment is available to patients suffering from xerostomia, and therefore there is an immense, unmet need for new treatment strategies for hyposalivation and xerostomia.\n\nStem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types, and stem cells have been suggested as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of stem cells from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.",

ARDS is common in severely ill patients in Intensive Care Units and is associated with a high mortality and a high morbidity in those who survive. ARDS occurs in approximately 20% case of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. There is a large economic burden with direct healthcare costs, but also indirectly due to the impact on the carer and patient through the patients inability to return to full time employment.

            "The American Heart Association suggests that heart disease prevention should target pregnancy and the first year of life; however, there is a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the effects of prenatal exercise on the prevention of heart disease.[1, 2] Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is believed to be a critical contributor to the metabolic syndrome which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Conversely, exercise improves insulin sensitivity and many other facets of skeletal muscle function and metabolism; however, it is unclear if this positive effect can be \"imprinted\" in the skeletal muscle of the fetus with maternal exercise and accordingly diminish CVD risk in offspring. Our previous studies found that exercise during pregnancy leads to improved heart measures and reduced adiposity.[3-6] These studies demonstrated the potential for maternal exercise to reduce risk for CVD, but the cellular mechanisms involved, however, are not clearly evident. The proposed project will fill this critical gap and assess the influence of maternal exercise intervention to \"imprint\" progenitor stem cells in the fetus (umbilical cord tissue) to develop into insulin sensitive skeletal muscle and also improve indices of infant morphometry and movement. Using a randomized design, 160 women will perform either exercise intervention (aerobic training, resistance training, or both) or usual care (controls). Infant cord tissue and blood will be sampled at birth while blood will be sampled at 1 month of age. Similarly, infant neuromotor and morphometric examinations will be performed at 1 month. and at 1-month of age via blood sample, neuromotor, and morphometric examinations. The rationale for the project is to elucidate the effects of maternal exercise on offspring health outcomes and determine specific metabolic targets predictive of offspring long-term disease risk. The investigators will test the central hypothesis that exercise during pregnancy alters skeletal muscle in a manner which decreases the risk of heart disease in offspring. To test this central hypothesis, the investigators will pursue two specific aims: Aim 1- Determine the ability of regular maternal exercise to imprint key myocellular metabolic (insulin sensitivity) properties of offspring mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), neuromotor function, and morphometry. Aim 2- Determine the distinct abilities of regular maternal exercise to imprint the metabolome of offspring MSC.",

The investigators hypothesize that at 6 months and 1 year participants receiving BMAC will have better scores reported on the WOMAC compared to the triamcinolone injection and better than prior to injection.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Evaluate the change of bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in participant's performance on the 6 minute walk test from baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be higher walking distances on the 6 minute walk test in the participants receiving a BMAC injection in comparison to triamcinolone starting at the 3 months follow-up time.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Quantify and correlate cell characterization with patient reported outcomes score.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be better patient reported outcomes in patients who have a higher concentration of mesenchymal stem cells injected.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 50 patients into each arm. Bone marrow will be aspirated then subsequently concentrated using the Emcyte PureBMC kit. The investigators will test the BMAC viability, rapid sterility, endotoxin, platelet concentration, volume, and total nucleated cell counts prior to injecting. The BMAC will be utilized as a hip injection into the affected hip of the patient.\n\nPatients receiving the Triamcinolone will undergo a sham bone needling to simulate the aspiration to keep patients blinded. Both groups will receive their injections under ultrasound guidance.",

            "Several studies have documented that transplantation of bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) following acute myocardial infarction is associated with a reduction in infarct scar size and improvements in left ventricular function and perfusion. The available evidence in humans suggests that BMC transplantation is associated with improvements in physiologic and anatomic parameters in both acute myocardial infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease, above and beyond the conventional therapy. In particular, intracoronary application of BMC is proved to be safe and was associated with significant improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure.\n\nIn contrast to ischemic heart failure, the data on effects of BMC transplantation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are limited to pre-clinical studies. In a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy, intramyocardial delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal cells improved LVEF, possibly through induction of myogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as by inhibition of myocardial fibrosis, suggesting that the beneficial effects of stem cell transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy may primarily be related to their ability to supply large amounts of angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and mitogenic factors. Similarly, transplantation of cocultured mesenchymal stem cells and skeletal myoblasts was shown to improve LVEF in a murine model of Chagas disease.\n\nStudy Aim:\n\nTo define the clinical effects of BMC transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy in a pilot clinical study investigating the effects of intracoronary CD34+ cell transplantation on functional, structural, neurohormonal, and electrophysiologic parameters in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy.",

The active and sequential secretion of these growth factors induces different cell signaling cascades that activate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, eventually leading to new matrix synthesis and tissue regeneration.\n\nThe potential benefits from the use of PRP for the treatment of cartilage defects rely on a number of studies conducted in validated animal models or in vitro, demonstrating the ability of PRP to stimulate collagen production and proteoglycans synthesis, as well as the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into chondrocytes. Additionally, an increasing number of clinical studies shows an improvement of symptoms, most especially pain, without any occurrence of serious adverse events.\n\nHyaluronic acid (HA), as one of the major components of the synovial fluid surrounding the cartilage, assumes an important role in the viscoelastic properties of the articular cartilage, conferring its shock absorbing and lubricating functions.\n\nIt was demonstrated that rheological properties of synovial fluid decrease with aging and in patients suffering from osteoarthritis. Nowadays, intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid represent a well recommended therapeutic option to relieve osteoarthritic symptoms, conferring a mechanical action on joints structures, thus leading to reduced pain and improved joint function Based on these data, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that a combination of both PRP and hyaluronic acid could provide greater benefits compared to the administration of each product alone, as their effects on osteoarthritis improvement are based on different mechanisms of action. In fact, on one side PRP promotes cartilage regeneration, while on the other side the HA acts as 3-dimensional support mesh for PRP, providing optimal release of platelets growth factors, strengthening and extending in time the activity of PRP.\n\nCellular MatrixTM is a CE-marked class III medical device manufactured by the Swiss company RegenLab SA.

Their prognostic value will be also tested.\n\nThe second objective is to test whether patients in complete remission have persistent pre-leukemic stem cells that overexpress MIF. Blood and bone marrow plasma, bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients in complete remission will be collected. MIF, CD74, and CXCR4 expression by hematopoietic cells at time of diagnosis and remission will be compared to determine which patients have a persistent overexpression/secretion of MIF. In the meantime, the persistence of initiating lesions in complete remission samples will be tested by NGS, digital PCR, FISH, or RT-PCR methods.\n\nThe third objective is to develop a pre-clinical model to target MIF in immuno-compromised mice (NSG mice) transplanted with primary AML cells and cells with pre-leukemic lesions. TET2 depletion leads to MIF over-expression/secretion by hematopoietic cells and improved multi-lineage NSG-repopulation capacity. MIF inhibitors and anti-MIF antibodies will be tested in these pre-clinical TET2-depleted models. Xenotransplantation of selected primary AML samples and xenotransplantation of TET2 depleted hematopoietic stem cells into NSG mice will be used.\n\nThe fourth objective is to understand how MIF is deregulated in pre-leukemic stem cells and how the MIF-dependent crosstalk between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and pre-leukemic stem cells or normal hematopoietic cells works.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms of MIF overexpression will be analyzed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from normal and leukemic bone marrow, with a focus on cells depleted in TET2 or DNMT3A. To study the cross-talk between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, pre-leukemic stem cells, and bone marrow MSCs, co-culture experiments will be performed using available MSC cell lines and primary MSCs from healthy donors.",

Though traditional rehabilitation therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, aiming to improve the neurological disorders of these patients, such as sensory disturbance, dyskinesia, autologous adjustment of blood pressure, dysfunction of urination, defecation and perspiration , etc. What's a pity, the efficacy of the rehabilitation therapy is unsatisfactory. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function.

The disease causessevere limitation in quality of life ranging from functional limitation to depression. Up to 20% of patients will be refractory to conventional treatment with diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and cyclophosphamide therapy.This favors the progression to visceral involvement including gastrointestinal,lung and pulmonary hypertension. The latter being a poor prognostic factor,increases mortality in this group of patients and drastically affects their qualityof life. For this reason, different therapeutic options have been considered including cell transplantation and Stem Cell use. Among the options that have been studied so far are stromal mesenchymal cells from Wharton \u0301s jelly. These have been used in intravenous infusion or direct application in different disease scenarios ranging from vascular involvement to interstitial lung involvement and cases of pulmonary hypertension, with promising results in terms of clinical progression,improvement in quality of life and prognostic indices.

            "Femoro-acetabular impingement is a well known cause of damage to the acetabular labrum and chondrolabral junction. Additionally, it has been proposed that disruption of hip biomechanics resulting from a labral tear causes a faster progression towards osteoarthritis (OA). This progression has been observed to begin with breakdown of the chondrolabral junction with later development of diffuse osteoarthritis. Use of hip arthroscopy has increased dramatically in recent years to treat symptomatic labral tears and potentially avoid the morbidity and cost associated with hip osteoarthritis.\n\nCorrection of labral pathology presents a technical challenge and many techniques currently exist. Increased understanding of the structure-functional relationship dictated by labral anatomy has led to the development of methods aimed at restoring functional anatomy by re-establishing the labrum's native position and contour on the rim of the acetabulum. Therefore, akin to repairing a torn meniscus in the knee, restoring the anatomic footprint of a torn labrum will reconstitute normal joint biomechanics.\n\nDespite the advances in techniques for labral repair, strategies for mitigating or repairing damage to the chondrolabral junction do not yet exist. This area has been shown to consist of hyaline and fibro cartilage. Many techniques for cartilage repair exist, although most are not feasible due to technical challenges specific to the hip joint.\n\nThe management of articular cartilage defects is one of the most challenging clinical problems for orthopaedic surgeons. Articular cartilage has a limited intrinsic healing capacity, and pathology frequently results in gradual tissue deterioration. Currently, the standard surgical intervention for end-stage degenerative joint pathology is total joint replacement. Early surgical interventions for symptomatic cartilage lesions including cell based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) implantation, or microfracture have been suggested to restore normal joint congruity and minimize further joint deterioration. Techniques such as ACI, which have been successfully used in the knee joint, have limited application in the hip due to the technical difficulties of open procedures.",

            "Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by a series of time-dependent events orchestrated by the innate immune system. This begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense sterile inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes including monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI. There is increasing evidence to suggest inflammation is not limited to the infarcted myocardium and systemic imbalances in the post-infarct inflammatory cascade can exacerbate adverse remodelling beyond the infarct site. Therefore, it is very important that therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and antiinflammatory pathways timely after AMI. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been shown to exhibit immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and paracrine secretion of bioactive factors that can attenuate inflammation and promote tissue regeneration, making them a promising cell source for AMI therapy. However, it has been proved in our and other studies that perfusion of WJMSCs after 5 days of AMI can only slightly improve left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is the most important indicator of left ventricular remodeling.

            "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of economy and medical level, the number of cases of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) develops rapidly in China. In 2019, 12,323 cases of HSCT were completed in China, with allo-HSCT accounting for 9600 cases of which.\n\nHowever, Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the most common and serious complications after Allo-HSCT. The incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) is as high as 40%-60% in HLA-matched sibling transplantation, and the incidence is even higher in haplo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(haplo-HSCT) and unrelated donor transplantation. By Glucksberg grading standard, the 5-year survival rates of grade III and IV aGVHD are 25% and 5% respectively, indicating severe GVHD directly affects the survival of Allo-HSCT patients.\n\nThe first-line treatment for aGVHD is still glucocorticoid, while the effective rate is only 30%-50%. Moreover, due to immunosuppression and increasing risk of infection, the efficacy of second-line treatments including polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, immunotoxins, chemotherapy drugs, and light therapy for steroid resistant aGVHD is also poor, with the overall survival rate of 5%-30%.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells, which can promote engraftment and hematopoietic reconstruction by secreting a variety of hematopoietic promoting factors, expressing adhesion molecules supporting hematopoietic stem cells, guiding homing of hematopoietic stem cells and providing hematopoietic microenvironment. At the same time, MSCs can modulate immune responses by affecting the proliferation of T cells and the migration of T cells and DC, inducing the expansion of Treg cells, inhibiting the secretion of antibodies by B lymphocytes, and regulating the secretion of soluble factors such as NO and IDO. As a result of these characteristics and the poor immunogenicity, MSCs are a promising alternative treatment for GVHD.\n\nCurrently, UK and EU guidelines has recommended MSC as a third-line treatment for grade 2-4 acute GVHD, and the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived MSCs in the prevention and treatment of GVHD has also been reported by several transplantation centers in China.However, MSCs have not been used for first-line treatment of aGVHD.

            "Osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint leading to cartilage damage, pain and loss of function affecting an estimated 250 million people worldwide and 27 million people in the United States . Currently, there are no effective FDA-approved therapies that are disease modifying interventions to prevent the course of joint destruction due to Osteoarthritis The most prevalent first-line treatment for OA is to mitigate pain and restore function with a combination of weight management, physical therapy, mind-body exercises, and analgesia with paracetamol or NSAIDs (topical or oral) . Another prominent treatment strategy is the use of intra-articular corticosteroids (CS) to reduce pain and inflammation via targeting production of interleukins, leukotrienes and prostaglandins However, the palliative effects of CS for OA are often short-term, can potentially lead to chondral fissuring and promotion of dose-independent structural changes in cartilage, and there are no consistent reports of efficacy .\n\nOne novel potential and appealing approach for treating Osteoarthritis is through the local and systemic elimination of senescent cells. Senescent cell burden increases significantly with age and has been shown to promote several age-related pathologies including degenerative joint conditions.\n\nSenescent cells are non-proliferative, resistant to apoptosis, and secrete pro-inflammatory factors that promote disease and systemic aging . Cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals that leads to the production of a collection of various proinflammatorycytokine and other factors that initiate senescence in neighboring cells and promote disease and tissue dysfunction.\n\nThus, senescent cells and their associate senescence associated secretory phenotype profiles likely play a role in both the clinical manifestation of OA (pain) and disease pathogenesis (tissue dysfunction and cartilage degradation. The overall safety and efficacy of several senolytic drugs to treat chronic diseases have been demonstrated in several preclinical studies and more recently in phase I-II clinical trials for OA. For example, the senolytic drug Dasatinib is an FDA approved drug for leukemia with few side effects while other senolytic drugs like quercetin and fisetin are naturally occurring plant flavonoids tolerable at relatively high doses .

            "Background:\n\nImproving implantation rates in ICSI cycles has been the focus of research in recent decades. Because success rates is not satisfactory enough especially when transferring good embryos to the uterine cavity and pregnancy does not occur. Trying to improve endometrial receptivity, the investigators have thought about stem cell therapy as stem cells have played a pivotal role in regenerative medicine in many pathologies as myocardial infarction, Diabetes Mellitus and spinal cord injuries.\n\nGarget and Healy reported in 2011 treatment of a case with Asherman's syndrome by administration of bone marrow stem cells in the uterine cavity. Endometrial growth and improved vascularity has been observed by ultrasound follow-up and Doppler study of endometrial blood flow. Endometrial regeneration has been enough to support pregnancy through successful IVF trial.\n\nThe investigators have succeeded in previous work to isolate MSC from placental tissue and differentiate it to endometrium-like cells. The investigators compared the differentiation ability of placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Wharton Jelly derived MSC to differentiate to endometrium under 3 different culture conditions: endometrium conditioned medium (ECM), follicular fluid (FF) conditioned medium and medium containing both. The investigators found that placental MSC has better differentiating ability to endometrium especially under culture conditions containing both ECM and FF as evidenced by prominent appearance of glandular pattern and expression of progesterone receptors in differentiated cells.\n\nTherefore the investigators need to direct this study and test the effect of placental derived MSC in improving implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure, unresponsive endometrium to ovulation induction drugs or with endometrial atrophy or advanced maternal age planning for ICSI trial.\n\nPatients and Methods:\n\n60 patients attending Kasr El-Aini assisted reproduction unit and private IVF center will be randomized to three groups by computer generated programs:\n\nThe first group, patients randomized to receive differentiated stem cell therapy:\n\nAfter ovum pick-up, MSC differentiated to endometrium is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter.

Ovum pick-up will be done as usual while all other steps will be the same including embryo transfer which will be done at day 5.\n\nThe third group, control group:\n\nPatients are randomized to receive no stem cell therapy; All ICSI steps from ovulation induction protocol to embryo transfer conditions will be the same for all groups.\n\nInformed consent will be taken from the patients after detailed explanation of all steps of the procedure.",

            "Obesity is at risk for the development of chronic kidney disease but the involved mechanisms are not known (Navarro et al. 2015). Establishing the link between obesity and kidney damage is difficult. Indeed, kidney function measurement lacks precision in obese people (Lemoine et al. 2014) and requires expensive methods such as measurement of 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Biopsies are too invasive for the detection of emerging kidney damage or for the following of the kidney function. Therefore new tools are required for the early identification of at risk individuals for the kidney damage complication.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells may represent such a relevant tool. These cells are present in a large number of organs, including kidney (Costa et al. 2020).\n\nIn addition to be differentiated cells progenitors (Dominici et al. 2006), they also support immunosuppressive, anti-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic functions that have been used for the treatment of kidney fibrosis (Usunier et al. 2014). Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells contribute to tissue homeostasis and their alterations may reflect organ dysfunctions. Indeed, mesenchymal stem cells from obese adipose tissue lose their immunosuppressive (Serena et al. 2016) and differentiation (Gustafson et al. 2009) functions and contribute to fibrosis (Keophiphath et al. 2009) and inflammation (Lee et al. 2010; Gustafson, Nerstedt, et Smith 2019). It is thus probable that kidney dysfunctions are associated with functional alterations of kidney mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nThe collection of mesenchymal stem cells from kidney can easily be performed from urine and next cultivated for amplification. They are called urine stem cells (USC).\n\nFrom our experience with obese mouse adipose stem cells, we observed that functional changes of stem cells preceded adipose tissue dysfunctions. Functional signatures of mesenchymal stem cells are thus representative of changes occuring in the function of the tissue notably in answer to obesity. These features could be used to identify obese people presenting ongoing alterations of kidney function, before clinical manifestations of kidney dysfunction. Because kidney mesenchymal stem cells are easy to isolate from urine, their collection is compatible with the follow up of patients and can be applied to a large number of individuals, including the younger. USC could represent a valuable tool to detect progression towards kidney damage.\n\nIn this project we plan to analyse USC alterations induced by obesity and to identify signatures associated with the progression towards kidney damage and type 2 diabetes. The goal is to evaluate USC as potential marker for the non invasive monitoring of patients in answer to a need that is not achieved by the present available approaches.",

            "Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to represent one of these.

            "Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing. The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.\n\nIn addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.\n\nMSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Critical Limb Ischemia.

Adult (18-60 years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from refractory epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included in this study. The pts were randomized to the standard treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (control group, 30 pts) or anti-epileptic drugs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (study group, 30 pts). The pts in the study group received one intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded MSCs (40-101 x 106 cells) and one subsequent endolumbal injection of neuroinduced MSCs (2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cells). Both the unfavorable reactions to MSC infusions and the clinical effects, including complications, were examined. The unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS; i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia).The possible beneficial effects of therapy in the two groups of pts were examined based on clinical observations and electroencephalography measurements (prior and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy). To determine potential changes in disease progression, the signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and particularly, changes in seizure character and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The main points of disease monitoring were \"yes\" or \"no\" responses (to therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to evaluate electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves based on standard and additional criteria. The paroxismality index, the peak frequency of EEG activity, the index of slow activity, and the summarized points of EEG pathology signs were calculated for each patient. All assessments were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to identify the potential differences between the two pts groups. Therapy was terminated when immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The final observation of each patient included clinical and EEG assessments at the time point of 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy.",

SARS-CoV-2 works like a hijacker (hackers), sabotaging communication between cells so that the immune system, like T-cells, kills not only infected cells but also healthy cells. This dysregulation results in hyper-inflammation which cause damage to organs, not just the lungs. This is the cause of the high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.\n\nExosomes are vesicles with a size of 30-100 nanometers originating from within cells that function to communicate with other cells. Exosomes are transport containers that contain bioactive cargo: such as proteins, genetic material, and various other molecules. These containers move from cells of origin, flowing through blood vessels or other body fluids to target cells. Exosomes penetrate the cell membrane and act on various organelles within the target cell.\n\nAll cell types can produce exosomes. What differentiates them is the cargo they contain. The exosome produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contains bioactive cargo derived from mesenchymal stem cells, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, messengerRNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). The target cells are immune system cells, infected cells and progenitor cells from infected organs. On target immune cells, the anti-inflammatory cytokines work as immunomodulators to relieve hyper-inflammation. In infected cells, the miRNAs work to prevent viral replication by inhibiting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA (viral mRNA silencing and degrading). In lung progenitor cells and other infected organs, the growth factors work to stimulate protein synthesis processes that function for organ regeneration.\n\nThis study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) clinical trial with two arms: one intervention arm, and one control arm.

Antifibrinolytics have been proven effective in reducing haemorrhage in patients who have undergone significant surgical operations with normal fibrinolysis, with the use of an appropriate surgical technique.\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that peak fibrinolytic activity is present for 6 hours after the incision and it persists for 18 hours in total knee and hip arthroplasty. The administration of the tranexamic acid in optional orthopaedic surgery of total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty reduces the postoperative haemorrhage, as well as the number and volume of the postoperative autologous blood.\n\nA trauma in the organism triggers the immunologic response. New term has been introduced - the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI), characterised by: a change on the immunologic cells (neutrophilia, monocytosis, increased number of mesenchymal stromal cells, reduced expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells, increased lymphocyte apoptosis, a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by Treg lymphocytes - CD4+CD25+CD127-); a change in production levels of various cytokines (anti-inflammatory cytokines): IL-10, IL-4; anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine: IL-6; pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3); the activation of the complement system (C5a and C3a via factor VII - tissue factor system, activated by cell damage).\n\nPost-traumatic immunosuppression can be made worse by transfusion, haemorrhage, stress, significant surgical operation and immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nThe research has shown that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).\n\nStopping haemorrhage prevents the occurrence of anaemia, as well as the need for transfusion of blood products, which lead to developing the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI).",

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out.

            "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studies clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.",

The LOC can be an important source of pain and affects comparatively younger, working age and athletically active patients.\n\nAlthough there are several therapeutic strategies, debridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically are the most frequent procedures. After this surgery, it is expected that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Though good results have been reported, this fibrocartilage presents histological characteristics of lower quality to those of the native articular cartilage.\n\nBased on previous studies in different joints, it is hypothesized that the augmentation treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal allogeneic stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with debridement and microfractures only.\n\nTherefore, the present study seeks to compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.",

Current treatment limitations have generated interest in alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, some with the aim of healing damaged articular cartilage. There has been preliminary support in the literature for reduced pain and improved functional performance in patients who receive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as part of a treatment regimen. MSCs can be costly and are limited by complex regulatory issues. This interest in an alternative isolation method lead to the development of Lipogems. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems. In addition, given the limitations of prior research on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids, the investigators will also include this as an additional study group to compare to placebo. There have been case reports published showing favorable outcomes. This would be the first study reporting data on the efficacy of Lipogems for pain relief in knee OA in a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample of patients.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that patients who receive an injection of Lipogems will experience a decrease in pain of the affected knee and an increase in joint functionality in comparison to placebo.

            "Crohn's disease is an immunologically mediated inflammatory bowel disease with a reported incidence of 4.0-7.0, 7.1, and 1.34 per 100,000 persons in Europe, the U.S., and Korea, respectively. Uncontrolled chronic inflammation finally causes various complications in intestine such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, and anal fissures.\n\nThe incidence of perianal fistula was reported in 13%- 39% of patients with Crohn's disease. Medical treatment for Crohn's fistulae initially focused on surgical intervention accompanied by symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressants. The most serious problem after surgical intervention is the relatively high incidence of postoperative anal incontinence caused by sphincter injury during the procedure. Conversely, available pharmacological therapies for Crohn's fistulae based on biologic agents such as infliximab do not generally reach ideal goal of treatment (e.g., complete closure of the fistula). A high recurrence rate after treatment with infliximab has also been reported, even after long-term maintenance therapy, which suggests that infliximab monotherapy does not provide adequate healing.\n\nThe ACCENT II study demonstraded a complete fistula healing in 25% of patients. To reach a better clinical outcome, combination treatment with infliximab and surgical intervention is highly recommended for management of Crohn's fistulae. Nonetheless, even this strategy does not result in a satisfactory healing for many patients.\n\nThe ideal therapeutic goal of treatment is not only complete closure of the fistula without recurrence but also preservation of anal sphincter function. Unfortunately, currently available medical or surgical treatment is not likely to offer a cure for perianal fistulae and, as noted above, recurrence is frequently reported.\n\nTogether with active research in the field of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, autologous or allogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been studied for management of Crohn's disease and other disorders.\n\nOf particular relevance to this study, ASCs could be considered to be safe and efficacious therapeutic tools for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. Importantly, ASCs do not cause fecal incontinence after injection into the lesion site in Crohn's disease patients. A phase I dose-escalation clinical study with ASCs manufactured by Anterogen Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) demonstrated the safety and therapeutic potential of these cells for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. A phase II study demonstrated a good rate of cronh's related fistula closure using a ASCS injection.\n\nActually the best accepted treatment of Crohn related perianal fistula, is the surgical procedure in association whit medical therapy.",

            "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death from COVID-19. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the violent storm of cytokines and chemokines, which cause uncontrolled fatal systemic inflammation by the immune system on the body, with additional multiple organ failure. Mortality in cases of severe ARDS caused by COVID 19 varies significantly between 50 and 90%, basically depending on the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nThe plasticity of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) regulates inflammation and immunity. MSC can promote and inhibit an immune response, depending on the dynamics of inflammation and depending on the activation force of the immune system, the types of inflammatory cytokines present, and the effects of immunosuppressants. Essentially, the state of inflammation determines the immunoregulatory fate of MSC. Thus, IV application of AMSCa has been shown to control the inflammatory response in various diseases, such as the graft-versus-host reaction and the ARDS caused by H5NI.\n\nThe objective of this study is to describe the clinical changes secondary to IV administration of MSC allogenic, in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, with the evaluation of the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, heart and respiratory rates, and the fever curve.\n\nFive patients, of either sex, over 18 years of age, with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe SIRA that has not improved with the standard management measures used at that time in the care center, will be included in the study.

            "The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue. Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized, single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed.",

This can be severe enough to require hospitalisation and potentially intensive care treatment.\n\nWhile they are being treated in hospital, COVID-19 infected patients can be found to have inflamed tissue in their lungs (referred to medically as \"pneumonitis\"). This inflammation is thought to be caused by their body's immune systems overacting to the infection rather than the COVID-19 virus itself. By potentially dampening down this overreaction of their immune system, it is hoped that COVID-19 patients with inflamed lungs have better and quicker chance to survive.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and healing properties on injured tissue. MSCs have been trialled in various diseases but have not yet been tested on patients with COVID-19. In this study, the investigators will obtain bone marrow from healthy volunteers to develop a cell-based treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonitis. The investigators will also determine whether it is feasible to recruit bone marrow donors in a clinically useful timeframe to treat COVID-19 patients. A future trial, COMET20, will use the bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) manufactured in COMET20d to treat COVID-19 patients suffering with pneumonitis, to determine whether the BMMSCs can reduce the likelihood for mechanical ventilation and reduce hospitalisation.",

            "Guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures have significantly evolved over the last 20 years. Significant advances have been made with various barrier membranes with or without the use of bone grafts and other materials. Some of the main limitations of non-resorbable barriers included cytotoxicity and need for removal, which can adversely affect the regenerated bone volume. Similar GBR success has been documented extensively with cell occlusive resorbable barriers membranes. Recently, the investigators demonstrated supracrestal bone regeneration in guided tissue regeneration procedures in humans with the use of novel perforated barrier membrane (MPM). The perforation allows mesenchymal stem cells and other progenitor cells present in the gingival tissues to migrate into the osseous defect and contribute to the osseous regeneration potential.\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the GBR potential of MPM in alveolar ridge defects, relative to a similar occlusive barrier. Ten non-smoking patients that need localized alveolar ridge augmentation prior to implant placement will be included into the study. Patients will be divided into two groups, as follows: occlusive bovine collagen membrane (OM control group, 5 patients) and modified bovine perforated collagen membrane (MPM test group, 5 patients). All sites will be grafted with mineralized cortical bone allograft and when needed cortical bone pins will be use for site stability. A Cone Bean (CT) will be obtained prior to surgery and 6-8 months post treatment from which volumetric width changes will be quantify. A bone biopsy will be obtained at the time of implant placement (~6-8 months) to determine residual graft particles and new bone formation. Dimensional width changes will be assess at 6-8 months during re-entry for implant placement. Soft tissue healing will be assessed at 2, 4, 8, 16 weeks and 6 months.\n\nThis study can potentially impact current bone augmentation techniques and may lead to the modification of existing commercial membranes that will enhance site development prior to implant placement. The contribution of progenitor cells to the osseous defect might lead to greater bone formation and possible faster wound healing.",
            "A debilitating consequence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is neuropathy which globally affects between 20 -30% of diabetic patients and up to 50% in other studies. The incidence of diabetic neuropathy (DN) is estimated to be up to 45% for type 2 diabetic patients and 59% for type 1diabetic patients in USA.(DN) is the most common complication of DM.The pathophysiology of DN is promoted by several risk factors: micro vascular disease, neural hypoxia, and hyperglycemia-induced effects.At the molecular level, the primary cause of diabetic complications is known to be hyperglycemia, which disrupts cellular metabolism by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).In the aspect of nerve functions, ROS formation increases neuron's susceptibility to damage. In addition, hyperglycemia impedes production of angiogenic and neurotrophic growth factors, which are necessary for normal function of neurons and glial cells and maintenance of vascular structure.No definitive disease-modifying treatments have been to reverse DN. The current treatment focuses on tight glycemic control which can reduce potential risk factors for further nerve damage and DN-associated pain management.In many studies, deficiency of neurotrophic factors and lack of vascular support have been regarded as key factors in the development DN.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are particularly attractive therapeutic agents because of their ability to self-renew, differentiate into multi lineage cell types, and locally secrete angiogenic cytokines, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) .These factors were reported to prompt neovascularization and have support for neural regeneration.It was plausible that MSCs may also be an effective therapeutic agent for the DN treatment through the paracrine effects of bFGF (Shibata et al., 2008) and VEGF and their potential to differentiate into neural cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes , and Schwann cells.The adherent nature of MSCs makes them easy to expand in culture and an attractive candidate to use in cell therapy.Therefore, cell therapy has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy to meet the needs of both neurotrophic and vascular deficiencies of DN.Proper diagnosis of DN depends on the pattern of sensory loss, reflex test, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging",

To date, there is no effective means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single injection of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the effects of BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological, immunological and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow aspirates, purified by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single dose of autologous BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and immunological assessments will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at 1, 3, and 6 months after transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after transplant. Proposed trial will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a feasible and safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an environment of immune tolerance and through the local production of neurotrophic/growth factors, might induce neuroprotection and improvement in CNS function.",

Furthermore adipose and umbilical cord as an allogenic source is more abundant in number compares to autogenic bone marrow. This enormous source need and adequate preservation technique before applied to the patient. According to that, researchers want to explore the potency of MSC from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose as the source of allogenic MSC and the effect of cryopreservation technique to the viability and quality of MSC. We will also compare the effectivity of MSC implantation from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose applied to non union fracture and long bone defect.\n\nSamples from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose are cultured and the viability of the cells are observed. Some of the cells are implanted directly to the patient with non union fractures and long bone defect while some are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen -190 degree Celsius in three months. All samples are thawed and the viability of the cells are observed. Patient who are implanted by MSC allogenic will undergo clinical and radiological examination in the third, sixth and twenty second month after implantation.",

SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monoclonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\n\nAccording to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair mechanisms, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College London for cell manufacturing.",

            "cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) about 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate.

            "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.\n\nIn this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis, ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies.",

            "Background: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a potent alkylating agent that targets several organs, especially lung tissue. SM exposure leads to serious changes in morphological structure of airway system, which is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary deficiency following exposure to SM. With extensive progress and achievements in tissue repair through stem cells therapy, consideration of lung tissue has been increased due to the high prevalence of pulmonary problems. Several factors such as selection of cell types, required conditions for growth and proliferation of stem cells, and the process of entering into the body to repair damaged lung tissue are considered as the most important problems in this issue. Accumulating studies, both in animals and human with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) support the hypothesis of therapeutic effects of these cells in various disorders. In this study investigators aimed to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of systemic MSC administration for treatment of chronic lung injuries in SM-exposed patients.\n\nMethods: Patients will receive 100 million MSC cells every two months for three injections within 6 months. After each injection, parameters including safety, pulmonary function testing (PFT), quality-of-life indicators, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), and expression of inflammation and oxidative stress genes will be evaluated.",

            "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease of motor neurons. In the early 1980s, Werdnig from Vienna University and Hoffman from Heidelberg University described this disorder. So SMA type 1 was named Werdnig- Hoffman disease. This is the first genetic disorder that cause death after cystic fibrosis in infants with the prevalence of 1 in 6000 birth. Mutation in the SMN1 gene (Survival Motor Neuron) is the reason for the disease that cause decrease in the SMN protein production. So the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord ventricle horn will be destroyed and it cause progressive paralysis and defenite death.No specific therapy is yet available for the treatment of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. Treatment is not disease-modifying and just is supportive. SMA type 1 is diagnosed within the early 6 month after birth and accompanied with breath disorders and definite death in 2 years. The affected infants have a weak muscle tone and they couldn't even hold their head up. Perhaps the only open way for these patients is the application of stem cells that could deliver trophic factor to the apoptotic cells. So this study focuses on the effectivness of cell therapy via adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells on the probable phenotypic changes in these patients.",

            "Formal study hypothesis:\n\nCranial reconstruction using mesenchymal stromal cells and resorbable biomaterials, will result in the patient producing their own bone to fill the void which will reduce the risk of infection and resorption, lead to a better cosmetic result and obviate any long term consequence of having a synthetic material in vivo.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThere are several reasons that parts of the skull may need to be removed:\n\nAfter trauma to relieve brain swelling\nDuring brain surgery (for brain cancer)\nAfter trauma where the bone is so badly fractured/fragmented it needs to be removed.\n\nIn all but the last case the bone flap is temporarily stored in a freezer and once the brain swelling has subsided it is reinserted. This procedure is called \"autologous cranioplasty\"; autologous, because it originally came from the patient and cranioplasty, referring to the repair. Although this is a straightforward procedure, there are a number of complications including infection and bone resorption that can occur.\n\nThis study:\n\nStromal cells have a proven ability to aid in bony healing. Furthermore stromal cells on a ceramic framework encased in a plastic scaffold have been shown in a small clinical trial to lead to healing of skull defects. In the present study, it is proposed to add stromal cells from a suitable donor to medical grade ceramic granules, place them in between specially moulded plastic scaffolds and insert the sandwich into the skull. Both the ceramic and plastic materials are medical grade and commonly used in reconstructive surgery, the ceramic for packing into bony defects due to trauma or removal of cancer and the polymer in bony reconstruction. Both materials are approved by the TGA. They are designed to dissolve away over time as the body's own blood vessels and cells populate the sandwich and create the patient's new bone. It has been proven that without the encouragement of the cells and temporary scaffold materials, a hole in the skull will not heal. Given the incidence of bone resorption/infection and metal plate infection using traditional methods, it would seem prudent to provide a construct that will allow controlled replacement with the patient's own bone, thus negating any adverse long-term complications with synthetic materials that remain for life.",

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501 ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As of April 6th, 2021, an estimated 132.1 million people have contracted the virus and 2,866,000 deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 30.8 million people diagnosed and 556,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation) caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such, therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes hyperinflammation due to \"cytokine storm\" and \"chemokine storm,\" tissue damage, hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.\n\nStage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6 therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3 COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.\n\nRAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are \"reprogrammed\" ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a \"hybrid\" product. The hybrid phenotype inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS.",

Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organs. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes.

            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as disease-modifying agents (DMDs).\n\nUnfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the deleterious immune reactions.

            "Bone fractures heal most of the time particularly well and without complications. The solidification takes rarely more than two to three months. The wound healing depends greatly on a good blood supply and needs several steps. These processes culminate in a new mass of heterogeneous tissue which is known as the fracture callus. Unfortunately, 2%-5% bone fractures cannot achieve a proper solidification and between the ununited fragments a scar tissue appears. This incorrect healing induces pain and even infections. When this situation persists more than 6 months, it is referred to as nonunion fracture, which will require some form of intervention to stimulate the natural healing process of the body. First of all, good surgical techniques with stable immobilization should be applied and local infection should be excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Cell therapy with bone marrow cells has emerged as a promising new approach for bone regeneration. Animal studies as well as preliminary human studies have shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells, a particular kind of stem cells isolated from the bone marrow, could induce callus formation when injected in the nonunion site of a broken bone.\n\nIn this study the investigators aim at determining whether Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) isolated from the patient's bone marrow and injected in the nonunion site could be a safe and effective treatment for nonunion fractures. Patients will be randomized in two groups; one injected with Mesenchymal Stem Cell and the other injected with placebo.

Evidence in preclinical studies of the application of stromal (mesenchymal) adipose tissue (hASC) in the ischemic heart by both the InCor group (in the animal model in rodents and pigs) and others in the literature suggest relevant benefits on the decrease of deterioration post-infarction. More recently it has been demonstrated that it arises mainly from the formation of new vessels due to paracrine factors, which are secreted by the injected cells. There are currently no studies in Brazil in which the safety of injecting different doses of hASC cells into the heart has been particularly evaluated. Recently, two studies have demonstrated the clinical applicability of hASC in patients with peripheral ischemic disease and stroke.\n\nThus, the objective of this work will be to test the hypothesis that the implantation of autologous stromal cells derived from adipose tissue combined with myocardial revascularization surgery in patients with coronary artery disease",

Long-term five-year prognosis for cGVHD patients is poor with a 70% mortality rate. cGVHD manifests as an autoimmune-like disease affecting multiple sites, including skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and joints. The oral cavity is the second most common site to be affected with symptoms in 45-83% of cases. In the mouth a diverse spectrum of clinical features can be found for example mucosal lesions can affect almost any site, salivary gland dysfunction and restricted mouth opening. Short-term patients can experience mucosal sensitivity, malnutrition, problems speaking, increased caries risk, xerostomia, oral pain and a diminished quality-of-life. Long-term complications include secondary malignancies and perhaps early death. Clinical management seeks to alleviate the symptoms and improve quality-of-life but 50% of patients fail front-line systemic steroid therapy. Oral cGVHD can be treated with topical high potency corticosteroids and oral rinses, however these treatments are not always effective and carry a risk of systemic absorption. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) resident in adult and fetal tissues, such as the bone marrow have the capacity to form bone, cartilage, stroma, muscle and fat, are known to exhibit immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. MSC infusions have been used to treat disorders such as osteogenic imperfecta, cardiovascular disease and to heal large bony defects. Indeed, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs have led to infusions being used as a second-line treatment for GVHD patients, and our group has shown within a Phase II clinical trial, 55% aGVHD patients who failed front-line steroid treatment responded to MSC infusion these studies are going with cGVHD patients. The goal of this project is to perform a pilot study to determine whether MSC injections directly into mucosal lesions in patients with oral cGVHD are able to alleviate the symptoms and facilitate the reparative process.",

The patients enrolled in this study will be those who lack matched sibling donors and therefore have no other option but to undergo bone marrow transplantation using matched but unrelated bone marrow or umbilical cord blood from the national marrow donor program registry. Since bone marrow transplantation for these disorders using matched unrelated donors has two major problems i.e. engraftment, or , the process of new marrow being accepted and allowed to grow in the the patient; and graft-versus-host disease, or the process where the new marrow \"rejects\" the host or the patient, this study has been devised with methods to overcome these two problems and thus make transplantation from unrelated donors both successful in terms of engraftment and safe in terms of side effects, both acute and long term.\n\nIn order to accomplish these two goals, two important things will be done. Firstly, patients will get three medicines which are considered reduced intensity because they are not known to cause the serious organ damage seen with conventional chemotherapy. These medicines, however, do cause intense immune suppression so these can cause increased infections. Secondly, in addition to transplantation of bone marrow from unrelated donors, patients will also transplanted with mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow of their parents. Mesenchymal stromal cells are adult stem cells that are normally found in the bone marrow and are thought to create the right background for the blood cells to grow. They have been shown in many animal and human studies to improve engraftment. In addition, they have a special property by which they prevent and are now even considered to treat graft versus host disease. Therefore, by using a reduced intensity chemotherapy regimen before transplant and transplanting mesenchymal stromal cells, we hope to improve engraftment while at the same time decrease the potential for severe side effects associated with a conventional transplant which uses extremely high doses of chemotherapy.",

The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third and sixth month after the fracture. First of all good surgical techniques are stable immobilization must be obtained and local sepsis excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Numerous techniques have been developed ranging from invasive interventions (including internal fixation with the use of bone graft or bone graft substitutes) to non invasive procedures (ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic fields).\n\nRecently, autologous cell therapy was presented as an interesting approach. The concept of such therapies is based on the effect of stem cells presented in the bone marrow and able to be transformed in osteoblast cells. The purpose of this study is to find if mesenchymal stem cells can stimulate bone regeneration in nonunion and delayed union fractures to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.",

In addition, MSC has ben shown to produce hepatocyte growth factor which is protective against liver injury and beneficial for liver regeneration (shown in above tables). However, it remains to be understood how MSCs promote liver stem stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes or expand the residual hepatocyte population. MSC can also directly inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, the main source of extracellular matrix via MSC derived IL 10 and TNF-\u03b1and may also induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis. Current lacunae in cell based therapy is based on the poor consensus and understanding on the best type of cells to be used, the ideal number of cells, the most appropriate route of administration and the need for repeat dosing . The concept that combination of autologous hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be more beneficial than infusing any one of them alone has been discussed in many scientific forums but there are no study till date to either see the safety as well as the efficacy of this proof of concept .\n\nWith this above background data, we propose a study design which will be a safety study for combination use of autologous CD34+ and MSC",

Currently, there is no available treatment and second eye involvement occurs in approximately 15-25% of the cases.\n\nAll this background originates a particularly dramatic outcome for the patient. Therefore, it seems justified to evaluate new therapies that maintain or improve the visual function in these patients.\n\nThe Project includes a clinical trial whose purpose is the assessment of the safety of intravitreal administration of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with NAION, a product in clinical research phase (PEI No. 15-007) already approved for other human clinical applications (PEI No. 15-007).\n\nIt can be considered that the therapy with intravitreal injection of MSC is a treatment option in patients with acute NAION, since through the paracrine properties of these cells (secretion of neurotrophic, immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic factors) it may prevent or reduce the progression of axonal degeneration caused by this disease.",

In treating these conditions, the conventional method were vascularised bone grafting and bone transport. But the existing methods of treatment have many weaknesses Vascularized bone graft is a procedure with a high level of difficulty. Hence not every orthopaedic surgeon were able to perform it. It also takes more operating time and its failure rate is also quite high.\n\nMeanwhile, external fixation which is applied with bone transport, was being often complained by the patient in terms of cosmetic and psychologically.\n\nAccording to diamond concept of bone healing, there are four main factors that influence the bone healing. These factors are osteogenic factor (mesenchymal stem cell), osteconductive factor (HA-CaSO4), osteoinductive factor (bone morphogenetic protein-2) and mechanical component (implant).

The ready access of SF MSC to cartilage and other joint tissues offers a novel strategy for joint repair. Current arthroscopic procedures result in the removal of all SF MSCs due to continuous irrigation throughout the procedure. The current study would benefit the patient by greatly increasing the reparative capacity of the joint by bolstering MSC numbers and retaining those MSCs within the joint after surgery.

            "Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination. The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs. Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin.Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow derived MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells.

Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue (ASCs) have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated their ability to evade recognition and actively suppress the immune system.\n\nThis knowledge is transferred into studies with COVID-19 patients having severe pulmonary dysfunction, to modify the virus induced immunological and inflammatory activity involved in the progression of disease often leading to prolonged ICU stay and in some occasion's death.\n\nWe will conduct a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary symptoms will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic CSCC_ASCs from adipose tissue.

Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have been shown to repair damaged liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, skin, cartilage, and cornea in animal models and several human trials. In addition to cellular replacement through regeneration, UCMSCs mediate through paracrine signaling pathways resulting in immune modulation. Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are believed to arise from septic shock and cytokine storm that cause acute respiratory dysfunction and acute cardiac injury. There is presently no cure for the COVID-19 viral disease; however, multi-treatment strategies are being examined. During the past two months, four reports were published that suggest, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful immunomodulatory ability, may prevent the cytokine storm and thus reduce the COVID-19 related morbidity. All studies reported that COVID-19 patients responded favorably to MSCs therapy. These reports, taken together with the previous successes of stem cell therapy in animal models, the investigators, a seven-institution consortium, propose to explore the efficacy of UCMSC treatment in COVID-19 patients at Jinnah hospital, Lahore. The investigators propose to administer UCMSCs in patients with acute pulmonary inflammation due to COVID-19 infection with moderate to severe symptoms. In the first cohort of 15 patients, UCMSCs will be administered with three intravenous infusions of 500,000 UCMSCs per Kg body weight each on days 1, 3, and 5. The second group of five patients serving as control will only receive standard treatment. During the 30-day post-infusion period, a battery of tests will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the UCMSCs treatment.

Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will develop MSA.\n\nThere are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a means of administering therapeutic agents.\n\nThe subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus clinical criteria for MSA.

The combination of these two products, respectively rich in autologous multipotent stem cells and growth factors, aims to create an optimal environment for cartilage cells regeneration. Furthermore, microfat semi solid phase is playing the role of a nutritive support matrix which contains and limits the diffusion and resorption of PRP liquid while allowing progressive growth factors release on the injection site.\n\nThe hypothesis of this project is that standardized injection of an innovative treatment (microfat and autologous PRP) should allow delay the use of invasive surgical therapy in the treatment of wrist osteoarthritis. This minimally invasive treatment could provide a curative second line treatment in case of medical treatment failure.",

            "The axons of the retinal ganglion cells combine to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits electrical signals to the visual cortex by various synapses. Optic nerve axons are more sensitive to toxins than retina because they are outside the blood retinal barrier. Methanol, various solvents and heavy metals, carbon dioxide, antiarrhythmic, antiepileptic, antibiotics and some vasoactive drugs can cause toxic optic neuropathy. There is a different pathophysiology for each toxin. Methanol is easily accessible alcohol in all types of disinfectants. Methanol is converted into formaldehyde and formic acid while metabolized in the liver. Formaldehyde disrupts ATP synthesis by blocking mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. Formic acid causes demyelination as a result of metabolic acidosis. Neuroinflammation occurs when denatured proteins block axoplasmic flow. All these processes can lead to apoptosis and permanent vision loss. Sildenafil is a vasoactive drug used in erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil decreases optic nerve head blood flow. Neuroinflammation develops secondary to the cessation of axoplasmic flow after hypoxia. If hypoxia and neuroinflammatiom persists, apoptosis and permanent vision loss develop. Amiodarone is an ion channel blocker used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Long-term use may cause disruption of ion channel balance in the optic nerve. This condition leads to asymmetric neuroinflammation and apoptosis.\n\nWharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) can increase mitochondrial ATP synthesis with paracrine effects and suppress neuroinflammation with immunomodulatory effects. Repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rEMS) can rearrange ion channel balances and axoplasmic flow.

            "Acute Liver Failure in children is associated with high mortality without liver transplantation. In addition, donor organ shortage makes it difficult to provide this treatment to every potential patient. Liver transplantation is life-saving but it carries the risk of major surgery and complications from lifelong anti-rejection drugs to suppress the immune system. If bridged across the immediate crisis following acute liver failure, the immense regenerative potential of the liver means that the patient's own liver may 're-grow'. This period is very time sensitive. Unfortunately, if the vital synthetic and detoxification function of the liver is not provided, the patient will often die before the liver can re-grow.\n\nTransplantation of liver cells (hepatocytes) can provide this 'bridge' with considerable advantages over whole organ transplantation. Firstly, hepatocytes are derived from donor livers which are otherwise unsuitable for transplantation. Secondly, unlike whole organs, they can be frozen and stored, thus act as an 'off the shelf' treatment. Thirdly, the technique of hepatocyte transplantation within microbeads coated with alginate (a gel originating from seaweed) and infused into the abdominal cavity is much less invasive than liver transplantation. Finally, the alginate protects the cells against the body's immune system, avoiding the need for immunosuppressive drugs and the associated major risks. Furthermore, preclinical work in King's College Hospital has shown that the addition of support cells called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), can significantly improve the ability of hepatocytes to survive and function within the alginate microbead.\n\nThe HELP trial is a Phase 1/2 safety and tolerability study of infusion of HMB002 (an optimal combination of hepatocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells put together in peptide-alginate microbeads) into paediatric patients with acute liver failure.

            "Many patients with osteoarthritis of the knee fail non-operative measures and elect to have knee arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. If successful, intra-articular mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections into the knee may offer another viable non-operative treatment modality. Additionally, this modality may have reparative or regenerative potential, which could lead to the first treatment for osteoarthritis that treats the underlying disease as opposed to symptomatic control.\n\nAdditionally, there are no acceptable non-surgical treatments for focal chondral defects of the knee. Surgical treatments that do exist have diminished outcomes if performed on patients older than age 30-40 years. If successful, intra-articular MSC injections into the knee would represent the first non-operative treatment for focal chondral defects and also represent a potential option for treatment in patients over the age of 30-40 years.\n\nThis trial will be a prospective, single-center phase I pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in 16 subjects, 8 who have knee osteoarthritis and 8 who have a focal chondral defect in the knee. Patients will undergo a bone marrow harvest procedure at the Dahms Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MSCs will be isolated and expanded. After approximately 2-3 weeks, patients will return for an intra-articular injection of 50x106 MSCs Subsequent study visits will occur on post-injection day 7 and months 2, 6, 12, and 24. Safety of intra-articular injection of MSCs will be evaluated at study visits by interval history, physical examination and assessment of any adverse events that are observed/reported. Additionally, efficacy will be evaluated by having patients complete functional outcome measures including: Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and Lysholm Knee Scale. These will be completed at the pre-treatment visit and then repeated at the 2, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up visits. Lastly, T1 rho and T2 mapping on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess for improved cartilage quality after intra-articular injection of MSCs. An MRI will be obtained at the pre-treatment visit. At the 12 and 24 month follow up visit, additional MRIs will be obtained and analyzed to compare the pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MRIs.",

            "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) to drugs.\n\nTo date, no curative drug has demonstrated with a good level of evidence its ability to promote SJS and TEN healing and could contribute to earlier reepithelialisation. Mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) therapy represents a new therapeutic approach. eg, in patients with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, renal transplantation, lung diseases as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nRecently, MSCs have been proposed in both burn wound healing with a significantly decrease of the unhealed burn area and in cutaneous radiation.\n\nMoreover, MSCs have immunomodulation properties potentially effective in refractory acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) by improving thymic function and induction of Tregs. Indeed, MSCs are able to migrate to inflamed tissues after stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines and to modulate the local inflammatory reactions. MSCs have also demonstrated their ability to promote tissue remodelling, angiogenesis and immunomodulation through either differentiation or secretion of several growth factors such as VEGF, basic FGF and various cytokines.\n\nTherefore, combining their immunomodulation effect and secretion of soluble factors involved in wound repair, MSCs might be valuable as a cell therapy strategy for promoting cutaneous healing in SJS-TEN syndrome and subsequently decrease the morbi-mortality.",
