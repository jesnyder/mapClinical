therefore, necrosis of a region leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. infarction can lead to a progressive and irreversible decrease in cardiac function, resulting in heart failure (hf) syndrome, depending on the area affected by this scar, via a ventricular remodeling mechanism.  in recent years, hf has been revealed as a major public health problem due to its incidence and its social, economic and especially human impact, as it represents a serious limitation of the quality of life of individuals. the prevalence of hf in the general population of the united states and the united kingdom is approximately 1%, and in those older than 75 years, the prevalence varies between 5 and 10%. regarding its prognosis, recent data from the framingham study indicate that at 5 years, the mortality rate of hf is 75% in men and 62% in women; the mean mortality rate of all cancers is 50%.  the molecular basis of congestive hf is the absence of cardiac cells capable of regenerating the heart muscle. despite the publication of recent studies suggesting the existence of stem cells capable of regenerating cardiomyocytes destroyed because of myocardial infarction, in humans, the capacity of these cells is insufficient to replace the cells destroyed due to necrosis secondary to ischemia.  in recent years, the accumulation of results derived from preclinical studies has allowed the development of the first clinical trials of the feasibility and safety of cardiac regeneration using cellular therapy. several studies have shown that t cells exist in adult bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and, more recently, multipotent stem cells (mapc), with the ability to differentiate into endothelial tissue and cardiac muscle, which can contribute to the regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function in animal infarction models. however, cell therapy research has moved rapidly toward the use of more undifferentiated cells rather than hematopoietic lineages, such as mesenchymal cells. these cells can be obtained from different sources, with a tendency toward the use of characterized allogeneic cells, which are immediately available in the potential recipient. given that this type of therapy has not been rigorously investigated in latin america, we aim to determine the effect of therapy using wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells (wj-mscs) from the human umbilical cord on neomyogenesis in patients with previous myocardial infarction who are undergoing open revascularization. our hospital has some experience with regenerative therapy, both in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic infarction, with encouraging results that support this new phase of inter-institutional research.  objective: to evaluate the safety and estimate the effect of coronary revascularization accompanied by intramyocardial injection of wj-mscs and the placement of an extracellular matrix patch seeded with wj-mscs compared to coronary revascularization accompanied by injection of culture medium without the presence of wj-msc and placement of an extracellular matrix patch without seeding with wj-msc on global and regional cardiac function, myocardial viability and the incidence of adverse effects determined as ventricular arrhythmias. biological: wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells biological: wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells parallel assignment a randomized clinical trial will be conducted as a proof of concept in 40 patients with previous myocardial infarction and a viable myocardial zone with indications for coronary artery bypass grafts. twenty patients will be included in each treatment arm over 36 months. one group will undergo revascularization surgery, extracellular matrix patch placement and injection of cell culture medium;

            " influence of maternal exercise on infant skeletal muscle and metabolomics influence of maternal exercise on infant skeletal muscle and metabolomicsthe american heart association suggests that heart disease prevention should target pregnancy and the first year of life; however, there is a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the effects of prenatal exercise on the prevention of heart disease.[1, 2] insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is believed to be a critical contributor to the metabolic syndrome which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd). conversely, exercise improves insulin sensitivity and many other facets of skeletal muscle function and metabolism; however, it is unclear if this positive effect can be \"imprinted\" in the skeletal muscle of the fetus with maternal exercise and accordingly diminish cvd risk in offspring. our previous studies found that exercise during pregnancy leads to improved heart measures and reduced adiposity.[3-6] these studies demonstrated the potential for maternal exercise to reduce risk for cvd, but the cellular mechanisms involved, however, are not clearly evident. the proposed project will fill this critical gap and assess the influence of maternal exercise intervention to \"imprint\" progenitor stem cells in the fetus (umbilical cord tissue) to develop into insulin sensitive skeletal muscle and also improve indices of infant morphometry and movement. using a randomized design, 160 women will perform either exercise intervention (aerobic training, resistance training, or both) or usual care (controls). infant cord tissue and blood will be sampled at birth while blood will be sampled at 1 month of age. similarly, infant neuromotor and morphometric examinations will be performed at 1 month. and at 1-month of age via blood sample, neuromotor, and morphometric examinations. the rationale for the project is to elucidate the effects of maternal exercise on offspring health outcomes and determine specific metabolic targets predictive of offspring long-term disease risk. the investigators will test the central hypothesis that exercise during pregnancy alters skeletal muscle in a manner which decreases the risk of heart disease in offspring. to test this central hypothesis, the investigators will pursue two specific aims: aim 1- determine the ability of regular maternal exercise to imprint key myocellular metabolic (insulin sensitivity) properties of offspring mesenchymal stem cells (msc), neuromotor function, and morphometry. aim 2- determine the distinct abilities of regular maternal exercise to imprint the metabolome of offspring msc. behavioral: types of exercise behavioral: types of exercise behavioral: types of exercise parallel assignment comparing 3 exercise interventions to a control (non-exercise) group   aerobic type of exercise combination type of exercise resistance type of exercise       moderate intensity exercise   types of exercise  behavioral",

            " safety and efficacy study of stem cell transplantation to treat dilated cardiomyopathy the effects of autologous intracoronary stem cell transplantation in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathyseveral studies have documented that transplantation of bone marrow-derived cells (bmc) following acute myocardial infarction is associated with a reduction in infarct scar size and improvements in left ventricular function and perfusion. the available evidence in humans suggests that bmc transplantation is associated with improvements in physiologic and anatomic parameters in both acute myocardial infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease, above and beyond the conventional therapy. in particular, intracoronary application of bmc is proved to be safe and was associated with significant improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) in patients with chronic heart failure.  in contrast to ischemic heart failure, the data on effects of bmc transplantation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are limited to pre-clinical studies. in a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy, intramyocardial delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal cells improved lvef, possibly through induction of myogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as by inhibition of myocardial fibrosis, suggesting that the beneficial effects of stem cell transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy may primarily be related to their ability to supply large amounts of angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and mitogenic factors. similarly, transplantation of cocultured mesenchymal stem cells and skeletal myoblasts was shown to improve lvef in a murine model of chagas disease.  study aim:  to define the clinical effects of bmc transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy in a pilot clinical study investigating the effects of intracoronary cd34+ cell transplantation on functional, structural, neurohormonal, and electrophysiologic parameters in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. biological: cd34+ autologous stem cell transplantation drug: bone marrow stimulation biological: sc therapy parallel assignment    sc group sc group sc group all all drugs and chemicals  m1945 lenograstim low peripheral blood stem cells will be mobilized by daily subcutaneous injections of filgrastim; cd34+ cells will be collected via apheresis and labeled with technetium. patients will undergo myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for myocardial viability assessment and the collected cd34+ cells will be injected intracoronary in the artery supplying the segments of reduced tracer accumulation patients will undergo filgrastim stimulation and viability assessment using the same protocol as in arm 1. however, in this group, no intracoronary stem cell delivery will be performed; the patients will receive placebo (saline). in the sc group, cd34+ cells were mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and collected via apheresis. patients underwent myocardial scintigraphy and cells were injected in the artery supplying segments with the greatest perfusion defect   cd34+ autologous stem cell transplantation bone marrow stimulation sc therapy g-csf stimulation biological drug biological",

            " use of bmac with hip arthroscopy treatment of fai and labral tear prospective proms outcomes in arthroscopic acetabular labral repair with and without application of platelet-rich plasma (prp) harvested from the body of the iliumfemoro-acetabular impingement is a well known cause of damage to the acetabular labrum and chondrolabral junction. additionally, it has been proposed that disruption of hip biomechanics resulting from a labral tear causes a faster progression towards osteoarthritis (oa). this progression has been observed to begin with breakdown of the chondrolabral junction with later development of diffuse osteoarthritis. use of hip arthroscopy has increased dramatically in recent years to treat symptomatic labral tears and potentially avoid the morbidity and cost associated with hip osteoarthritis.  correction of labral pathology presents a technical challenge and many techniques currently exist. increased understanding of the structure-functional relationship dictated by labral anatomy has led to the development of methods aimed at restoring functional anatomy by re-establishing the labrum's native position and contour on the rim of the acetabulum. therefore, akin to repairing a torn meniscus in the knee, restoring the anatomic footprint of a torn labrum will reconstitute normal joint biomechanics.  despite the advances in techniques for labral repair, strategies for mitigating or repairing damage to the chondrolabral junction do not yet exist. this area has been shown to consist of hyaline and fibro cartilage. many techniques for cartilage repair exist, although most are not feasible due to technical challenges specific to the hip joint.  the management of articular cartilage defects is one of the most challenging clinical problems for orthopaedic surgeons. articular cartilage has a limited intrinsic healing capacity, and pathology frequently results in gradual tissue deterioration. currently, the standard surgical intervention for end-stage degenerative joint pathology is total joint replacement. early surgical interventions for symptomatic cartilage lesions including cell based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (aci), bone marrow aspirate concentrate (bmac) implantation, or microfracture have been suggested to restore normal joint congruity and minimize further joint deterioration. techniques such as aci, which have been successfully used in the knee joint, have limited application in the hip due to the technical difficulties of open procedures. biological: bmac     bmac application       a bone marrow biopsy needle will be inserted through an arthroscopy portal and directed to the acetabuloplasty site. bone marrow is aspirated then centrifuged. from the centrifuged sample, the buffy coat layer (layer of cells, found between the red blood cells and the plasma layers) is removed. the buffy coat layer contains mesenchymal stromal cells. this is called bmac or bone marrow aspirate concentrate. the bmac will be injected into the intra-articular space.   bmac  biological",

            " senolytic agents &osteoarthritis evaluation of the efficacy of natural senolytic agents and nlrp3 inhibitors in treatment of osteoarthritis:randomized, single blinded ,placebo controlled trialosteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint leading to cartilage damage, pain and loss of function affecting an estimated 250 million people worldwide and 27 million people in the united states . currently, there are no effective fda-approved therapies that are disease modifying interventions to prevent the course of joint destruction due to osteoarthritis the most prevalent first-line treatment for oa is to mitigate pain and restore function with a combination of weight management, physical therapy, mind-body exercises, and analgesia with paracetamol or nsaids (topical or oral) . another prominent treatment strategy is the use of intra-articular corticosteroids (cs) to reduce pain and inflammation via targeting production of interleukins, leukotrienes and prostaglandins however, the palliative effects of cs for oa are often short-term, can potentially lead to chondral fissuring and promotion of dose-independent structural changes in cartilage, and there are no consistent reports of efficacy .  one novel potential and appealing approach for treating osteoarthritis is through the local and systemic elimination of senescent cells. senescent cell burden increases significantly with age and has been shown to promote several age-related pathologies including degenerative joint conditions.  senescent cells are non-proliferative, resistant to apoptosis, and secrete pro-inflammatory factors that promote disease and systemic aging . cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals that leads to the production of a collection of various proinflammatorycytokine and other factors that initiate senescence in neighboring cells and promote disease and tissue dysfunction.  thus, senescent cells and their associate senescence associated secretory phenotype profiles likely play a role in both the clinical manifestation of oa (pain) and disease pathogenesis (tissue dysfunction and cartilage degradation. the overall safety and efficacy of several senolytic drugs to treat chronic diseases have been demonstrated in several preclinical studies and more recently in phase i-ii clinical trials for oa. for example, the senolytic drug dasatinib is an fda approved drug for leukemia with few side effects while other senolytic drugs like quercetin and fisetin are naturally occurring plant flavonoids tolerable at relatively high doses . clinical trials about the use of senolytic agents as therapeutic agents in different clinical cases:-  senescent cell burden in hematopoietic stem cell

(nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (nlr) and pyrin domain containing receptor 3) the hyperactivation of nlrp3 inflammasome is involved in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. the search

            " impact of obesity, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes on human urinary stem cells impact of obesity, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes on human urinary stem cellsobesity is at risk for the development of chronic kidney disease but the involved mechanisms are not known (navarro et al. 2015). establishing the link between obesity and kidney damage is difficult. indeed, kidney function measurement lacks precision in obese people (lemoine et al. 2014) and requires expensive methods such as measurement of 99mtc-dtpa clearance. biopsies are too invasive for the detection of emerging kidney damage or for the following of the kidney function. therefore new tools are required for the early identification of at risk individuals for the kidney damage complication.  mesenchymal stem cells may represent such a relevant tool. these cells are present in a large number of organs, including kidney (costa et al. 2020).  in addition to be differentiated cells progenitors (dominici et al. 2006), they also support immunosuppressive, anti-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic functions that have been used for the treatment of kidney fibrosis (usunier et al. 2014). therefore, mesenchymal stem cells contribute to tissue homeostasis and their alterations may reflect organ dysfunctions. indeed, mesenchymal stem cells from obese adipose tissue lose their immunosuppressive (serena et al. 2016) and differentiation (gustafson et al. 2009) functions and contribute to fibrosis (keophiphath et al. 2009) and inflammation (lee et al. 2010; gustafson, nerstedt, et smith 2019). it is thus probable that kidney dysfunctions are associated with functional alterations of kidney mesenchymal stem cells.  the collection of mesenchymal stem cells from kidney can easily be performed from urine and next cultivated for amplification. they are called urine stem cells (usc).  from our experience with obese mouse adipose stem cells, we observed that functional changes of stem cells preceded adipose tissue dysfunctions. functional signatures of mesenchymal stem cells are thus representative of changes occuring in the function of the tissue notably in answer to obesity. these features could be used to identify obese people presenting ongoing alterations of kidney function, before clinical manifestations of kidney dysfunction. because kidney mesenchymal stem cells are easy to isolate from urine, their collection is compatible with the follow up of patients and can be applied to a large number of individuals, including the younger. usc could represent a valuable tool to detect progression towards kidney damage.  in this project we plan to analyse usc alterations induced by obesity and to identify signatures associated with the progression towards kidney damage and type 2 diabetes. the goal is to evaluate usc as potential marker for the non invasive monitoring of patients in answer to a need that is not achieved by the present available approaches. biological: urine collection biological: urine collection biological: urine collection biological: urine collection     non-obese patients with impaired renal function non-obese patients with normal renal function (control group) obese patients with impaired renal function obese patients with normal renal function       to isolate urine stem cells, a sample of 30ml minimum an 100ml maximum as a function of the patient, will be collected in a single time in a sterile flask during collection for the nephrologic exams. a transcriptome analysis of usc will be performed.   urine collection  biological",

component will evaluate two dose levels of rapa-501-allo off the shelf cells in patients with covid-19-related ards, with key endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of rapa-501 allo off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether rapa-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.  the covid-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. as of april 6th, 2021, an estimated 132.1 million people have contracted the virus and 2,866,000 deaths have resulted globally. the united states has the highest totals with an estimated 30.8 million people diagnosed and 556,000 deaths. in stages 1 and 2 of covid-19, viral propagation within the patient is predominant. as such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications (remdesivir). in marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of covid-19, stage 3, is driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation) caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. as such, therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-cytokine therapy (anti-il-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. unfortunately, such interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 covid-19, which includes hyperinflammation due to \"cytokine storm\" and \"chemokine storm,\" tissue damage, hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). the pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. there is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as rapa-501-allo off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid treg/th2 cells.  stage 3 covid-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of icu utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ards and multiorgan failure. narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-il-6 therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 covid-19 and the broad anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3 covid-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (msc) and now, with the current rapa-501-allo protocol, regulatory t (treg) cells. treg therapy has a mechanism of action that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts treg therapy at the forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) and graft rejection. in addition, treg therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places treg cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). rapa-501-allo off-the-shelf cell therapy offers this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects for effective treatment of covid-19 and multiple lethal conditions.  rapa-501-allo cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. during manufacturing, t cells are \"reprogrammed\" ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves t cell de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory programs, the treg and th2 pathways, thus creating a \"hybrid\" product. the hybrid phenotype inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in covid-19, including modulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of multi-organ damage. the hybrid treg and th2 phenotype of rapa-501-allo cells cross-regulates th1 and th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of covid-19. rapa-501 immune modulation occurs in a t cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell therapy. finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ards, treg cells mediate a protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. because of this unique mechanism of action that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic rapa-501 t cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of covid-19-related ards. biological:

            " therapy of toxic optic neuropathy via combination of stem cells with electromagnetic stimulation bioretina inc ankara university technopolisthe axons of the retinal ganglion cells combine to form the optic nerve. the optic nerve transmits electrical signals to the visual cortex by various synapses. optic nerve axons are more sensitive to toxins than retina because they are outside the blood retinal barrier. methanol, various solvents and heavy metals, carbon dioxide, antiarrhythmic, antiepileptic, antibiotics and some vasoactive drugs can cause toxic optic neuropathy. there is a different pathophysiology for each toxin. methanol is easily accessible alcohol in all types of disinfectants. methanol is converted into formaldehyde and formic acid while metabolized in the liver. formaldehyde disrupts atp synthesis by blocking mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. formic acid causes demyelination as a result of metabolic acidosis. neuroinflammation occurs when denatured proteins block axoplasmic flow. all these processes can lead to apoptosis and permanent vision loss. sildenafil is a vasoactive drug used in erectile dysfunction. sildenafil decreases optic nerve head blood flow. neuroinflammation develops secondary to the cessation of axoplasmic flow after hypoxia. if hypoxia and neuroinflammatiom persists, apoptosis and permanent vision loss develop. amiodarone is an ion channel blocker used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. long-term use may cause disruption of ion channel balance in the optic nerve. this condition leads to asymmetric neuroinflammation and apoptosis.  wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (wj-msc) can increase mitochondrial atp synthesis with paracrine effects and suppress neuroinflammation with immunomodulatory effects. repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rems) can rearrange ion channel balances and axoplasmic flow. the aim of this prospective phase-3 clinical study is to investigate the effect of wj-msc and rems combination in the therapy of toxic optic neuropathies. this combination is the first study in the literature for the therapy of toxic optic neuropathies. biological: wharton jelly derived mesenchymal stem cell device: repetitive electromagnetic stimulation device: repetitive electromagnetic stimulation biological: wharton jelly derived mesenchymal stem cell parallel assignment the cases were divided into 3 groups according to their similar demographic characteristics. prospective open label   only wj-msc wj-msc combine witf rems only rems wj-msc combine witf rems       wj-msc rems   wharton jelly derived mesenchymal stem cell repetitive electromagnetic stimulation cordosight magnovision biological device",

            " potential use of autologous and allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with multiple system atrophy potential use of autologous and allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with multiple system atrophythe prevalence of multiple system atrophy (msa) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per 100,000 population. the estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year. many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the difficulty in differentiating msa from other disorders. approximately 29 - 33% of patients with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will develop msa.  there are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. the current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. mesenchymal stem cells (msc) are considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic potential. results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of msc-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. stem cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, mscs have been shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a means of administering therapeutic agents.  the subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible msa based on the consensus clinical criteria for msa. there will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5 subjects each.  group 1 will
