				<h1>Clinical Trials using Mesenchymal Stromal Cells as the Therapeutic Intervention</h1>
				<p><b>Global Map of Clinical Trials</b><br>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been used as a therapeutic intervention in 889 clinical trials since 1994. These trials have enrolled more than 45,000 participants in countries across the globe. The source of these cells has oscillated between patient derived (autologous) and off-the-shelf standards (allogeneic). A handful or trials even use both sources. Most trials do not declare a source. Of those that do, more cite allogeneic MSCs - 185 allogeneic compared to 115 autologous trials. The allogeneic trials have collectively enrolled more participants - 9,254 allogeneic compared to 4,549 autologous.
        <br>
        This interactive map geolocates the trials and assigns each one to a group based on the cell source: allogenic (orange), autologous (dark purple), both (light blue), or undeclared (gray). A trial can only belong to one group. If a trial has multiple study sites, it will appear multiple times on the map. Right click on the circular marker to see the trial title, location name, and a link the NIH ClinicalTrials site with more information. The radius of the circular marker shows the number of particpants enrolled in the trial. Larger circles enrolled more particpants. Use the +/- in the upper left hand corner of the map or your mouse scroll whell to zoom in and out of the map. Use the timeline along the bottom edge of the map to see when trials first started. Press play to animate the trials to appear according to their start date. The button on the top right corner of the map allows you to prescriptively show or hide some of the groups.Following the map are interactive charts. Click on the name of the group in the legend to show/hide the data on the chart.

        All data for the map comes from the US NIH database ClinicalTrials.gov. The code to make the map is open source and freely available.</p>

        <h1>Making the Map</h1>
        <p><b>Method</b><br>The US National Institute of Health (NIH) maintains a database of clinical trials. We searched this repository, ClinicalTrials.gov, using the "Intervention" field looking for "mesenchymal stromal" or "mesenchymal strem" or "allogeneic mesenchymal" or 'autologous mesenchymal'. Results from different searches were coregistered using the url to prevent double-counting of any one trial. The trials were geolocated based on the location of the trial, this can be and often is distinct from the sponsor of the study. Many trials had multiple locations and so those appear multiple times on the map. The size of the circle pointer annotating the trial location is determined by the number of participants enrolled in the trial.  </p>
