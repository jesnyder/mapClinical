Some patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure, for which there is no specific therapy. Therefore, safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia is utterly necessary, mainly in critical cases.

Each item consists of five levels of answers (1=no difficulty/symptoms, 2=mild difficulty/symptoms, 3=moderate difficulty/symptoms, 4=severe difficulty/symptoms, and 5=extreme difficulty (unable to do)/symptoms). The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability). Greater DASH scores reflect greater disability (worse outcome). DASH score is a self-assessment of symptoms and function of the entire upper extremity comprising 30 items. Each item consists of five levels of answers (1=no difficulty/symptoms, 2=mild difficulty/symptoms, 3=moderate difficulty/symptoms, 4=severe difficulty/symptoms, and 5=extreme difficulty (unable to do)/symptoms). The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability). Greater DASH scores reflect greater disability (worse outcome). The scoring system records individual parameters and provides an overall clinical functional assessment. It consists of 4 domains: pain, activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, and power/strength. Pain and ADL are self-assessed, while all other items are assessed by the blinded examiner. A higher score shows a better function (100 as the best), while a lower score shows a worse function (0 as the worst). The scoring system records individual parameters and provides an overall clinical functional assessment. It consists of 4 domains: pain, activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, and power/strength. Pain and ADL are self-assessed, while all other items are assessed by the blinded examiner. A higher score shows a better function (100 as the best), while a lower score shows a worse function (0 as the worst). A systematic review (D'Ambrosi et al., 2019) showed that re-tear rates after rotator cuff repair with scaffolds were 17.97%. We hypothesize that the augmentation using HAM (as scaffold) seeded with AAdMSC would further lower the re-tear rates. We plan to record the recurrence of supraspinatus tendon tear (if any) based on radiographic evaluation with ultrasonography, which will then be confirmed with MRI. Ultrasonography provides an excellent anatomical evaluation of soft tissue which is able to assess any alterations during active locomotion. However, due to its user-dependent nature, we will also confirm the findings with MRI examination. Any grade of re-tear (grade I-III as evaluated by ultrasonography and confirmed with MRI) will be counted in and classified as ""re-tear"".

Respiratory Rate-Oxygenation (ROX) index is defined as the ratio of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)/ Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to respiratory rate. This index can be used in the assessment of disease progression and the risk of intubation in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. Measure of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and its usage within the body during intensive care, measured using fNIRS (Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy). The calculation for Oxygenation index is ((FIO2 * Mean airway pressure)/partial pressure of oxygen). Measuring the respiratory mechanics; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and plateau pressure (Pplat) in ventilated patients visit 8 (day 6) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from a minimum of 0 (normal) to a maximum of 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). The total score corresponds to the sum of the six different scores of the organ systems. In total, the minimum SOFA score is 0 (normal) and the maximum SOFA score is 24 (highest degree dysfunction/failure). SIT measures the participant's sense of smell. SIT has a total score ranging from 0 to 40 with the higher the score indicating a more normal sense of smell As assessed via serum blood samples. As assessed via serum blood samples. Measures the total amount of the oxygen-carrying protein in the blood as assessed via serum blood samples.

Number of participants alive at 60 days post first infusion follow up. Time to discharge or, if the subject was hospitalized, no longer requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring COVID-19-related medical care by 31 days. The numbers represent days at which 25%, 50%, 75% subjects within the treatment group had recovered. Number of days participants were off ventilators during 28 days post second infusion. Number of days participants were off ventilators within up to 90 days of hospitalization. Respiratory Rate-Oxygenation (ROX) index is defined as the ratio of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)/ Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to respiratory rate. This index can be used in the assessment of disease progression and the risk of intubation in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. Measure of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and its usage within the body during intensive care, measured using fNIRS (Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy). The calculation for Oxygenation index is ((FIO2 * Mean airway pressure)/partial pressure of oxygen). Measuring the respiratory mechanics; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and plateau pressure (Pplat) in ventilated patients visit 8 (day 6) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from a minimum of 0 (normal) to a maximum of 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). The total score corresponds to the sum of the six different scores of the organ systems. In total, the minimum SOFA score is 0 (normal) and the maximum SOFA score is 24 (highest degree dysfunction/failure). SIT measures the participant's sense of smell. SIT has a total score ranging from 0 to 40 with the higher the score indicating a more normal sense of smell As assessed via serum blood samples. As assessed via serum blood samples.

The developers used the SF-36 as a base and added 18 questions to address MS-specific problems, including fatigue and cognitive function.  This 54-item questionnaire provides 12 sub-scales, two summary scores, and two extra single-item measures. The sub-scales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There is no single overall score for MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores (scale scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher scale score indicates improved quality of life). |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  To investigate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by improvements in the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL) 54 Instrument. |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  Baseline to Week 52 |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. This scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5-unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist. The Barthel index is an ordinal scale that evaluates functional independence in the domains of personal care and mobility. A total of ten variables describing activities of daily living and mobility are considered, with a higher number reflecting better capacity to operate independently. The Barthel Index assesses the level of help needed by a person on a set of ten activities of daily living (ADL) related to mobility and self-care. The 9-HPT is a short, standardized upper extremity exam. It measures the time taken to complete the test activity, recorded in seconds. The higher the score the worse the disability. The PHQ-9 is the most used depression and suicidal thoughts screening test used to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment.  Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.

Pain intensity is the most common pain domain assessed in research and clinical settings. Although different rating scales have proven to be valid for assessing pain intensity, the 11-point NRS has the most strengths and fewest weaknesses of available measures. An 11-point NRS measure of pain intensity allows for comparison across clinical trials of chronic pain treatment and has been recommended by the IMMPACT consensus group for use in pain clinical trials and by the 2006 NIDRR SCI Pain outcome measures consensus group. We will evaluate changes in scores between baseline and 6 months. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in Numerical Rating Scale |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  6 months |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  Activity-dependent shoulder pain intensity will be assessed using the Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI). The WUSPI is a 15-item self-report instrument that measures shoulder pain intensity in wheelchair users during various ADLs over the past week; for example, transfers, loading a wheelchair into a car, wheelchair mobility, dressing, bathing, overhead lifting, driving, performing household chores, and sleeping. Each item is scored using a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS) which is anchored at the ends with ""no pain"" and ""worst pain ever experienced."" Individual item scores are summed to arrive at a total index score, which ranges from 0 to 150. We will evaluate changes in scores between baseline and 6 months. The subject will be asked to rate on a 7-point scale his or her overall impression following treatment as compared to the previous measurement interval. The 7-point PGIC scale (also referred to as the original Guy/Farrar-PGIC scale; anchored by ""very much improved"" and ""very much worse"") is used to measure global treatment effect and is recommended as a compliment to unidimensional pain intensity scales. Although other versions of the PGIC scale exist, the SCI Measures Pain Committee recommends using the original Guy/Farrar-PGIC scale in clinical trials since it has been used extensively and been shown to be sensitive to change. We will evaluate scores at 6 months. The PESS will be derived from findings during the shoulder examination performed. The PESS was developed to apply a grading system to commonly-used provocative tests for the diagnosis of shoulder soft-tissue disorders. Eleven physical examination maneuvers are given a score dependent upon the pain elicited: 0 (no pain), 1 (equivocal for pain), or 2 (pain present). The scores are summed for a total between 0 and 22. The physical examination maneuvers include: biceps tendon/bicipital groove tenderness; supraspinatus tendon/greater tuberosity tenderness; acromioclavicular joint tenderness; resisted external rotation; resisted internal rotation; supraspinatus test; painful arc test; Neer impingement sign; Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign; O'Brien active compression test for acromioclavicular joint and labral pathology. We will evaluate changes in scores between baseline and 6 months. All participants will undergo a clinical ultrasound examination. The ultrasound will be performed by a physiatrist with musculoskeletal ultrasound training. The Ultrasound Shoulder Pathology Rating Scale (USPRS) applies a grade to seven ultrasound findings for shoulder pathology. The scale is designed to give an impression of global shoulder pathology associated with overuse. A score of 0 indicates no observable pathology, up to a maximum of 23. The exams include biceps tendinosis/tendinopathy; supraspinatus tendinosis/tendinopathy; greater tuberosity cortical surface irregularities; bursal thickening; joint edema; dynamic supraspinatus and subscapularis impingement. We will evaluate changes in scores between baseline and 6 months. Quantitative ultrasound protocols will be used to evaluate changes in morphological and structural characteristics of the supraspinatus tendon after treatment. We will collect conventional B-mode ultrasound images alongside shear wave elastography images and apply custom image analysis algorithms to quantify the parameters of interest. Greyscale parameters of interest include tendon thickness and mean echogenicity (i.e. ""brightness""), which are reflective of inflammation and edema. This method will be adapted based on a previously-validated technique that has been used in wheelchair users with SCI. The primary elastography parameter of interest is strain ratio; that is, the strain within the ROI relative to a reference point in the deltoid muscle immediately outside the tendon. We will evaluate changes in greyscale and shear wave parameters between baseline and 6 months. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index Patient Global Impression of Change Physical Examination of the Shoulder Scale Ultrasound Shoulder Pathology Rating Scale Quantitative Ultrasound of the Supraspinatus Tendon |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months | ",All,18 Years - 70 Years,Phase 2,24.0,OTHER,Interventional, , ,"June 14, 2019","April 30, 2022","April 30, 2022","July 1, 2019",,"February 18, 2020",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT04136743," ultrasound-guided treatments for shoulder pain in wheelchair users with spinal cord injury ultrasound-guided treatments for chronic shoulder pain in wheelchair users with spinal cord injury: a randomized controlled trial drug: dexamethasone device: lipogems parallel assignment  d000000893 d000000932 d000001337 d000018373 d000045505 d000005765 d000005938 d000006728 d000006730 d000018931 d000000970 anti-inflammatory agents antiemetics autonomic agents peripheral nervous system agents physiological effects of drugs gastrointestinal agents glucocorticoids hormones hormones, hormone substitutes, and hormone antagonists antineoplastic agents, hormonal antineoplastic agents micro-fragmented adipose tissue corticosteroid infl aneo anem gast all anti-inflammatory agents antineoplastic agents antiemetics gastrointestinal agents all drugs and chemicals test m6254 m16126 m16127 m237968 m209570 m235540 m3369 m3403 m8033 m8199 m8941 m8940 m20119 dexamethasone triamcinolone triamcinolone acetonide triamcinolone hexacetonide triamcinolone diacetate dexamethasone acetate anti-inflammatory agents antiemetics gastrointestinal agents glucocorticoids hormones hormone antagonists antineoplastic agents, hormonal high low low low low low low low low low low low low the lipogems system (lipogems international spa, milan, italy) is designed to isolate autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue without enzymes or other additives. it uses mild mechanical forces to break down adipose tissue that is extracted from the patient into a form that can be injected into the tendon lesion and other degenerated tissues in a sterile and safe manner. the resulting product is rich in pericytes and mesenchymal stromal cells, retained within an intact stromal vascular niche, that is ready for use in clinical applications. triamcinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid, which is a class of drugs that are commonly prescribed for shoulder pain. they work to reduce pain by limiting inflammation. they are typically injected into the subacromial space with or without ultrasound guidance. d000003907 dexamethasone lipogems dexamethasone micro-fragmented adipose tissue corticosteroid device drug","Rotator cuff disease (i.e., rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear) is a common cause of shoulder pain in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Millions of plastic and reconstructive surgeries are performed annually to repair soft tissue defects due to trauma, tumor resection and congenital defects. Surgical options for lipoatrophy, the lipodystrophy type characterized by subcutaneous adipose tissue atrophy, include: Transfer of autologous fat, Dermis - fat graft, Skin flaps and Commercially available fillers.

Currently, the most commonly filler agent used for the lipodystrophy treatment is polymethylmethacrylate, considered permanent and with a history of short- and medium-term adverse effects. Biocompatible and temporary filler agents such as hyaluronic acid, polylactic acid and collagen have been used for over 25 years for cosmetic purposes and in lipoatrophies. More recently, the use of autologous fibroblasts proved to be efficient solving acne scars and enabling dermis regeneration. Studies in mice showed that the combination of pre - adipocytes with a biomaterial is much more effective in tissue reconstitution than the injection of adipose tissue only, providing volume and also stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation with increased production of extracellular matrix.

Mesenchymal stem cells are able to produce growth factors that provide support to diseased nervous cells.

In this study mesenchymal stem cells will be harvested from the bone marrow, cultivated in a test tube so that they multiply and then infused into the arteries that supply blood to the brain in 20 patients suffering from a rare form of parkinsonism, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Each patient will undergo two infusions, one with the stem cells and one without, at an interval of 6 months. The sequence of the two infusions will be assigned randomly; patients and assessors will not know the sequence (double-blind). Patients will be followed-up for up to 1 year after the last infusion, with regular assessments to assess safety, efficacy on motor and cognitive functions, and effects on the brain by neuroimaging techniques.

The study has a preliminary phase with 5 patients all given stem cell therapy alone, designed to assess safety","Clinical Trial to Evaluate Bone Marrow Stem Cell Therapy for PSP, a Rare Form of Parkinsonism","Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: a Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Clinical Trial",,

When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The umbilical cord blood cells will be grown (""expanded"") on a special layer of cells collected from the bone marrow of healthy volunteers in a laboratory.

Following a bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant, a proportion of patients develop a condition called 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD). In this condition the transplanted cells recognize the recipient as foreign and bring about an immune-mediated destruction of tissues. The treatment for this condition is to use drugs that will cause immunosuppression. A small subset of these patients develop a severe form of GVHD (Grade III or IV) which, in spite of the best currently available treatment, is associated with eventual death in more than 90% of cases. The investigators propose to use infusions of expanded MSC from the donor to treat this condition. A few reports on this approach have already been published in peer reviewed journals and preliminary results appear to be promising. The investigators are also aware that larger trials have been initiated to study this. After getting written informed consent, the investigators will infuse expanded MSC into patients who develop steroid-resistant GVHD.",Evaluation of the Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Graft Versus Host Disease,Evaluation of Potential Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Graft Versus Host Disease Following an Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant,,

If any of following occurring in 28 days, VFDs equals 0:  The patient dies in 28 days; Ventilator never be weaned; Censored case with ventilator never being weaned. The oxygenation index(OI)=partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood(PaO2) divide inspiration fraction of oxygen(FiO2). OI is measured at day0, day1,day3,day7. Murray lung injury scores (LIS) consist of the following 4 parts:  A.Hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2≥300, 225-299,175-224,100-174,<100, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively); B.PEEP (cmH2O) (≤5,6-8,9-11,11-14,≥15, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively) ; C.Compliance (ml/cmH2O)(≥80,60-79,40-59,20-39,≤19, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively); D.Quadrants infiltrated in Chest X-Ray(CXR) (0,1,2,3,4, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively).  The total LIS score is obtained by dividing the total sum of points by the number of criteria present. For example, if only 3 criteria are answered to, the total sum is divided by 3 to reveal the final score.  The LIS score ranges between 0 and 4, with scores closer to 4 indicating severe acute lung injury.

In addition for each category, the sum and difference between the two routes of delivery of the proportions will be reported as percent incidence. Confidence Intervals at the 95% confidence level and P-values for these four groups will be calculated.

The purpose of this study is to collect information that will be used to determine if MSCs can be used to decrease inflammation and possibly slow down enlargement of the participants' aneurysm. The investigators will also be collecting blood samples to study special inflammatory cells that cause aneurysms as well as asking participants to have a ""PET"" (positron emission tomography) scan that can measure inflammation directly in the participants' aneurysm.",Safety and Efficacy of Allogeneic MSCs in Promoting T-regulatory Cells in Patients With Small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,Mesenchymal Stem Cells Induce Regulatory T Cells in Patients With Aortic Aneurysm,,

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response as indicated by the investigator's pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .

Objective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.

Study design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.

Main study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.",Allogeneic MSC Treatment for Pulmonary Emphysema,An Explorative Study for Halting Inflammation in Patients With Emphysema by Administration of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.,,

This index is based on the Classic BILAG index and has many similarities with its predecessor: it is based on the principle of the physician's intention to treat, has transitional property that captures changing severity of clinical manifestations and has a similar ordinal scale scoring system. However, it has nine systems and many of the changes (from the Classic BILAG index) are in the items, glossary and scoring scheme. As with the Classic BILAG index, the individual system scores were not intended to be summated into a global score. The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) has played an influential role in establishing health outcome assessment as a quantifiable set of reliable, valid and responsive hard data points. The HAQ is based on five patient-centered dimensions: disability, pain, medication effects, costs of care, and mortality. It has been validated by mail, in the office, by telephone, and by comparison with paraprofessional and physician judgments as a reliable instrument, and has been significantly correlated with other PRO instruments. Typically, one of two HAQ versions is used: the Full HAQ, which assesses all five dimensions, and the Short or 2-page HAQ, which contains only the HAQ disability index (HAQ-DI) and the HAQ's patient global and pain visual analog scales (VAS). |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  BILAG-2004 score Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  changes of month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12 after treatment changes of month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12 after treatment | ",All,18 Years - 60 Years,Not Applicable,30.0,OTHER,Interventional, , ,January 2017,September 2019,January 2020,"February 7, 2018",,"March 12, 2018",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT03458156," umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for lupus nephritis clinical study of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for lupus nephritis biological: sle group biological: ln group other: the control group parallel assignment    sle group ln group the control group       the patients will be assigned to systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) group, receiving umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. the patients will be assigned to lupus nephritis (ln) group, receiving umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. the patients will be assigned to the control group.   sle group ln group the control group  biological biological other",To investigate the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN).,Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation for Lupus Nephritis,Clinical Study of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation for Lupus Nephritis,,

Currently, there are no drugs that modify the natural course of the disease. As analgesic therapy becomes insufficient, more invasive measures are applied, ultimately leading to arthroplasty.

The scientific community has joined efforts to develop new therapeutic approaches that allow the delay and regeneration of injured tissue in these patients. These include cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources. Although most of the clinical studies carried out in different parts of the world with this therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis have shown therapeutic benefit, it is necessary to develop clinical trials with high quality in our population.

The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Cellistem-OA (biological therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord) in patients with knee osteoarthritis in the Colombian population.

Investigators proposed to carry out an experimental (clinical trial), randomized, controlled and parallel with 30 participants with knee knee osteoarthritis of the medical complex Fundación Oftalmológica de Santander Clínica Carlos Ardila Lulle. The participants will be randomized into two groups: i) 15 patients who will receive a dose of 2 x 106 Cellistem-OA and ii) 15 patients who will receive an active comparator (acetonide of triamcinolone 10mg / mL), which will be administered by intra-articular injection in the superolateral aspect of the knee. The outcomes to be evaluated will be: (i) decrease in joint pain, (ii) increase in joint functionality, (iii) improvement in quality of life and (iv) improvement of articular cartilage.

In Europe, about one million patients encounter a surgical bone reconstruction annually and the numbers are increasing due to our ageing population. Bone grafting intends to facilitate bone healing through osteogenesis (i.e. bone generation) at the site of damage, but this is only attained presently by including cells capable of forming bone into the augmentation.

Bone autograft is the safest and most effective grafting procedure, since it contains patient's own bone growing cells (to enhance osteogenesis) and proteins (to enhance osteoinduction), and it providing a scaffold for the new bone to grow into (osteoconduction). However, bone autograft is limited in quantity (about 20 cc) and its harvesting (e.g. from the iliac crest) represents an additional surgical intervention, with frequent consequent pain and complications.

We hypothesize that using autologous bone marrow cells expanded in GMP facility surgically implanted with synthetic bone substitutes contribute to the resolution of the health and socioeconomic complications of delayed union or non-union after diaphyseal and metaphyseal-diaphyseal fractures with safety and efficacy.",Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Autologous MSCs Combined to Biomaterials to Enhance Bone Healing,Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Autologous MSCs Combined to Biomaterials to Enhance Bone Healing in Patients With Delayed Consolidation After Long Bone Fracture Requiring Graft Apposition or Alternative Orthobiologics,,

Patients are rated on ten items, each of which has value ranges from 0 (the least pathology) to 6 (the most sever pathology). Sum scores range from 0 to 60, with a scoring of 20 indicating moderate and 30 severe depression. The scale is sensitive to change and covers many, but not all, symptom domains in depression. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in depression as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  baseline, week 8, week 26 |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) assesses functional impairment. FAST is a 24-item scale and assesses six functional domains: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive, financial issues, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Higher scores indicate higher degrees of functional impairment. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. The scale is presented and described in the DSM-IV-TR on page 34. The Clinical Global Impression Scale for bipolar lllness (CGI-BP) is a modification of the CGI specifically for use in assessing global illness severity and change in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis. The clinician forms a global judgment both of the severity of the illness as compared to other cases with the same diagnosis and the global degree of change during treatment. There are 3 subscales (severity of mania, severity of depression, severity overall); and each subscale has a range of values from 1 (best) to 7 (worst).

California Verbal Learning Test (second edition (CVLT-II)). The adult version was chosen because it is one of the most widely used neuropsychological tests. This test consists of verbal list learning and memory test. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) assesses problem-solving ability and is thought to be an index of functioning of the prefrontal cortex. The task requires subjects to match cards to one of four target cards according to a certain sorting rule (color, shape or number) without explicit instructions regarding the nature of the sorting rule. After 10 consecutive matches, the sorting rule changes without warning, and the subject needs to determine the new principle. Perseverative errors and number of categories achieved will be used as dependent measures. The Bioplex 200 (Bio-Rad) will be used for multiplex biomarker analysis. The Bioplex 200 (Bio-Rad) will be used for multiplex biomarker analysis. The YMRS is an 11-item scale that is used to assess the severity of mania. Each item is given a severity rating--four items are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in Functional impairment as assessed by the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) Change in Overall functioning in living as assessed by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar illness (CGI-BP), severity of mania subscale Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar illness (CGI-BP), severity of depression subscale Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar illness (CGI-BP), severity overall subscale Change in neurocognition as assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test Change in problem-solving ability as assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) Number of participants with inflammatory markers as assessed by multiplex biomarker analysis Number of participants with inflammatory markers as assessed by multiplex biomarker analysis Change in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Change in C-reactive protein (CRP) level as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Number of participants with a change in brain activity between baseline and week 26 as assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Number of participants who withdrawal due to Adverse Events (AEs) Number of participants with suicidal ideation based on clinical assessment Number of participants with treatment emergent mania or hypomania as assessed by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and clinical assessment |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 baseline, week 26 week 26 week 26 week 26 | ",All,18 Years - 65 Years,Phase 1,30.0,OTHER,Interventional, , ,"June 1, 2021","July 1, 2024","July 1, 2024","March 29, 2018",,"September 7, 2022",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT03522545, adjunctive allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells for treatment-resistant bipolar depression adjunctive allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells for treatment-resistant bipolar depression biological: allogeneic bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) biological: placebo parallel assignment    allogeneic bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal placebo       allogeneic bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) isolated from hematogenous bone marrow placebo for allogeneic bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs)   allogeneic bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) placebo  biological biological,The overall objective of the investigators is to assess the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Derived Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) isolated from hematogenous bone marrow for treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression patient (TRBD).,Adjunctive Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Treatment-resistant Bipolar Depression,Adjunctive Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Treatment-resistant Bipolar Depression,,

Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be easily isolated and culture expanded from bone marrow aspirates and provide an excellent source of progenitor cells for cell-based regeneration strategies due to their ex vivo differentiation and proliferation capacity. Although there are hints that MSCs derived from OA patients may exhibit altered function the role of MSCs with respect to disease development and progression of OA is not clearly understood to date. To assess whether advanced-stage OA affects MSCs' suitability for musculoskeletal regenerative therapy, in the present study, we compare proliferation and differentiation potential of MSCs from osteoarthritic versus healthy donors.",Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Osteoarthritis,Proliferation and Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells From Osteoarthritic Versus Healthy Donors,,

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a serious life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. The outcome for patients with aGVHD is poor and overall survival is low. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as the major complication of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT), limits the application of this curative therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells, which are able to modulate immune response in vitro and in vivo, and have possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as aGVHD. MSCs obtained from umbilical cord (UC) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. In addition, UC-derived MSCs can be used for off-the-shelf use and are obtained without any harm to donors than bone marrow-MSCs. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs in patients with aGVHD.",Safety and Efficacy of UC-MSC in Patients With Acute Severe Graft-versus-host Disease,"Open-Label, Single-Center, Self Control, Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and the Efficacy of Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Acute Graft-versus-host Disease",,

Recently, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated remarkable potential effect in sepsis. MSC treatment significantly reduced mortality in septic mice receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy. MSCs reduced systemic inflammatory cytokine levels in mice, down-regulated of inflammation and inflammation-related genes (such as interleukin-10, interleukin-6). Bacterial clearance was greater in MSC-treated mice. Thus, MSCs have beneficial effects on experimental sepsis and suggest that MSСs-therapy may be an effective adjunctive treatment to reduce sepsis-related mortality.

The safety of MSCs is proved by Graft-versus-host disease treatment MSCs in patients after bone marrow transplantation.

This study hypothesis is that MSCs reduce organ dysfunction/injury, systemic inflammation and mortality in patients with septic shock and severe neutropenia.

The main goal of the study is to evaluate the impact of MSCs therapy on organ dysfunction/injury, systemic inflammation and 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and severe neutropenia. All patients will be randomized in two groups: control group (standard treatment of septic shock) and MSCs-group (standard treatment of septic shock + MSCs infusion of 1-2 millions/kg/ day).",Russian Clinical Trial of Mesenchymal Cells in Patients With Septic Shock and Severe Neutropenia,Russian Single-center Open Randomized Clinical Trial of the Impact of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Therapy on Organ Dysfunction and 28-day Mortality in Patients With Septic Shock and Severe Neutropenia.,,

Stoller's criteria were used in the classification of meniscal injuries, including 0-3 grades, in which: 0 grade, the shape of meniscus was regular, complete and even low signal; 1 grade, focal ellipse or circular high signal appeared in the meniscus, which did not extend to the articular surface and margin of the meniscus; 2 grade, the meniscus showed horizontal linear high signal extending to the articular margin of the meniscus.  But it did not exceed the articular surface; in grade III, the shape of meniscus was irregular and incomplete. Irregular or linear high signal appeared in the meniscus and extended to the articular surface of meniscus. The grade I and II symptoms of meniscus injury were mild, suggesting meniscus degeneration, and grade III suggesting meniscus tear.

The grade I and II symptoms of meniscus injury were mild, suggesting meniscus degeneration, and grade III suggesting meniscus tear. The arthroscopic classification of knee joint cartilage injury refers to the classification criteria formulated by the International Association of Cartilage Repair, which includes 0-IV grades, of which: 0 grade is normal articular cartilage; 1 grade is the surface injury of cartilage with soft edema on the surface, with only small cracks and intact structure; 2 grade is partial cartilage injury, which extends downward from the surface, but the depth of injury is less than 50% cartilage thickness. Grade III, deep articular injury, injury depth > 50% cartilage thickness or through the whole layer; Grade IV, deep articular cartilage injury to the bone cortex, full-thickness cartilage defect, subchondral bone exposure. The degree of meniscus injury under arthroscopy was classified into three grades, including normal, degenerative and tear. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Hospital for special surgery knee score postoperative 1 month Hospital for special surgery knee score postoperative 3 month Hospital for special surgery knee score postoperative 6 month Hospital for special surgery knee score postoperative 12 month Hospital for special surgery knee score postoperative 24 month Hospital for special surgery knee score postoperative 36 month Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative Day 1 Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative Day 2 Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative Day 3 Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative Day 7 Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative 1 month Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative 3 month Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative 6 month Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative 12 month Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative Day One Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative 24 month Visual Analogue Scale Postoperative 36 month Evaluation of cartilage repair under MRI postoperative 12 month Evaluation of cartilage repair under MRI postoperative 24 month Evaluation of cartilage repair under MRI postoperative 36 month Degree of meniscus injury under MRI postoperative 12 month Degree of meniscus injury under MRI postoperative 24 month Degree of meniscus injury under MRI postoperative 36 month Evaluation of cartilage repair under arthroscope postoperative 12 month Degree of meniscus injury under arthroscope postoperative 12 month |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  postoperative 1 month postoperative 3 month postoperative 6 month postoperative 12 month postoperative 24 month postoperative 36 month Postoperative Day 1 Postoperative Day 2 Postoperative Day 3 Postoperative Day 7 Postoperative 1 month Postoperative 3 month Postoperative 6 month Postoperative 12 month Postoperative Day One Postoperative 24month Postoperative 36 month Postoperative 12 month Postoperative 24 month Postoperative 36 month postoperative 12 month postoperative 24 month postoperative 36 month postoperative 12 month postoperative 12 month |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  The patient squatted on the floor and then stood up completely for five consecutive times, recording the time required.

Patients and methods

Clinical trial phase I- II, randomized , multicenter , with three treatment arms and 10 patients for each group. The investigators compare the intraarticular injection of hialuronic acid against the administration of two different doses of mesenchymal stem cells with hialuronic acid according to the following scheme:

Group A: intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (Hyalone®). Single dose.
Group B: Low Dosage of MSCs . Intra-articular injection of 10 million autologous mesenchymal progenitor stem cells cultured ex - vivo (cell suspension sterile small volume (5-10 ml ) in a vehicle suitable for intraarticular injection ) followed by an intraarticular injection Hiaurónico Acid ( Hyalone®).
Group C : High dose of MSCs. Intra-articular injection of 100 million autologous mesenchymal progenitor stem cells cultured ex - vivo ( cell suspension sterile small volume (5-10 ml ) in a vehicle suitable for intraarticular injection ) followed by an intraarticular injection Hiaurónico Acid (Hyalone®).

The primary endpoint is safety and feasibility. The investigators registered the occurrence of complications and / or adverse effects during the study.

In addition the investigators assess the response to intra-articular infusion of CMM analyzing the following parameters:

Clinical assessment of pain and function (Baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months since treatment): VAS , WOMAC , KOOS , EuroQol, SF-16, Lequesne , WOMAC , KOOS.
Radiographic (baseline, 6 and 12 months since treatment): Femorotibial space.
Radiographic using MRI (baseline, 6 and 12 months since treatment): by assessing the number location of the lesions , cartilage thickness , signal intensity , subchondral bone alteration , volume and WORMS and dGEMRIC protocols.",Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis by Intra-articular Injection of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Treatment of Osteoarthritis by Intra-articular Injection of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells,,

nutrients related to wound healing.   personalized nutritional intervention  dietary supplement","The ageing population and the increase in diabetes raise the prevalence of chronic skin ulcers (CCU). In diabetics, precursor cell mobilization decreases. In wounds, the inflammation is prolonged and oxidative stress increases. This is an unfavorable microenvironment for healing. A major risk factor in the development of CCU is nutritional deficiency. Healing needs energy and nutrients for regeneration. In diabetics the malnutrition can be more than 60%. However, although the provision of certain nutrients can improve the healing capacity, it is not a common clinical practice to nutritionally evaluate diabetic with CCU. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that reflect the physiological state of the cells producing them. Stem cell derivatives exosomes are rich in factors, that can provide a favorable microenvironment for tissue regeneration.

The aim of this project is to develop a therapeutic process to accelerate the healing of diabetic CCU, based on the correction of nutritional deficiencies, to improve the regenerative capacity, together with the application of exosomes from mesenchymal stem-cell (MSC) in the wound, creating a microenvironment that favors tissue regeneration. For this, a pilot clinical trial with diabetic patients with CCU is proposed, to evaluate the effect of personalized nutritional supplementation on healing and regenerative capacity.",Evaluation of Personalized Nutritional Intervention on Wound Healing of Cutaneous Ulcers in Diabetics,Evaluation of Personalized Nutritional Intervention Together With the Application of MSC-derived Exosomes on the Regenerative Capacity and Wound Healing of Cutaneous Ulcers in Diabetics,,

Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating GVHD. Therefore, the investigator designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute or chronic GVHD.",Umbilical Cord Blood-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Steroid-refractory Acute or Chronic Graft-versus-host-disease,Umbilical Cord Blood-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Steroid-refractory Acute or Chronic Graft-versus-host-disease,,

Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to enhance the viability of the grafted fat and the reliability of the final outcome of surgery. In the current study potential of mesenchymal stem cells will be studied by comparing two groups of patients requiring fat grafting for contour deformities of face.

In Tegner-Lysholm knee scoring, examinations for the knee joint (Limp, support, pain, instability, locking, swelling, stair-climbing, and squatting) will be evaluated, and a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0 points will be given. According to the evaluation, <65 points are interpreted as bad, 65-83 points as fair, 84-90 points as good, >90 points as excellent. Scores will be recorded by being examined before treatment and at the 6th, and 12th months after treatment. Knee functions of the control group will be evaluated simultaneously, and the effects of treatments on knee function will be determined. The physical activity evaluation of the participants will be evaluated with the IPAQ (international physical activity questionnaire) short form. IPAQ short form will be evaluated and recorded before treatment and at the 6th, and 12th months after treatment. The control group's physical activity will be evaluated simultaneously, and the effects of treatments on physical activity will be determined. Pain assessment of the participants will be evaluated with VAS (Visual analog scale). The VAS will be evaluated and recorded before treatment and at the 6th, and 12th months after treatment. The physical activity of the control group will be evaluated simultaneously, and the effects of treatments on pain will be determined. Participants will receive knee x-ray imaging and knee magnetic resonance imaging before treatment. The same radiological imaging will be performed at the 6th and 12th months after the treatment. At the same time, the same radiological imaging will be performed on the control group, and the effects of treatments on radiological imaging will be evaluated. Before treatment and at the 6th and 12th months after treatment, cytokine levels (IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β, IFN-ɣ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, MCP-1, VEGF) and gene analyzes (IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β, IFN-ɣ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, MCP-1, IL-1ra, MIP-1b, CTGF, TGFβ3, BMP-2, BMP-4, IGF-1, IGF-2, PDGF, EGF, and VEGF genes) will be checked in the samples taken from the synovial fluid and blood. Samples will be taken from the control group along with the treatment group. In this way, the effects of treatments on cytokine levels will be evaluated. Edema in both knees will be measured using a tape measure by marking the midpoints of both patellae. Pre-treatment measurements will be recorded. Measurements of both knees will be recorded at 6 months and 12 months after treatment. The knees of the patients not receiving treatment will be measured simultaneously, and the changes will be compared. The range of motion of both knees will be measured using the ""Baseline Digital Absolute+Axis Goniometer."" Knee extension measurements will be made with the patient in the supine position and flexion in the prone position. Pre-treatment measurements will be recorded.

Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Besides, regulatory T cells(Tregs) had been proved as an immune regualtory T cell subsets, which could reduce immune cell activation and reduce liver injury severity. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.",Safety and Efficacy Study of Co-transfering of Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Regulatory T Cells in Treating End-stage Liver Disease,Phase 1 Clinical Trial Using Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Regulatory T Cells as Individualized Medicine to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy in End-stage Liver Disease,,

Clinical review and questionaires for pain, disability and quality of life at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months Clinical review, questionaires for pain, disability and quality of life at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months.  WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index): Questionnaire to quantify the pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.  SF-12 (Short Form 12, an abbreviated form of SF36) is a questionnaire for the detection of changes in quality of life.  The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used for subjective measurements of knee pain.  LEQUESNE algofunctional index: is a composite measure of pain and disability, with specific self-report questionnaires for knee (osteoarthritis).  All the scale ranges ranges (minimum and maximum scores) are between 0 and 100%.  Values are given in differences from baseline (usually negative values). More negative values show more improvement on both scales. Magnetic Resonance imaging measurements of T2 relaxation (Cartigram) performed at 0, 6 and 12 months to quantify articular cartilage degeneration. The values (in milliseconds) are T1/2 for decay of the T2 MRI signals. Normal values are below 50 ms; values above 50 ms correspond to inflamed cartilage.  Mean (SD) are expressed as the number of values (of a total of 88 measurements) that are between 50 and 90 ms. A value =<4.4 is considered normal (can be attained by chance).

WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index): Questionnaire to quantify the pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.  SF-12 (Short Form 12, an abbreviated form of SF36) is a questionnaire for the detection of changes in quality of life.  The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used for subjective measurements of knee pain.  LEQUESNE algofunctional index: is a composite measure of pain and disability, with specific self-report questionnaires for knee (osteoarthritis).  All the scale ranges ranges (minimum and maximum scores) are between 0 and 100%.  Values are given in differences from baseline (usually negative values). More negative values show more improvement on both scales. Magnetic Resonance imaging measurements of T2 relaxation (Cartigram) performed at 0, 6 and 12 months to quantify articular cartilage degeneration. The values (in milliseconds) are T1/2 for decay of the T2 MRI signals. Normal values are below 50 ms; values above 50 ms correspond to inflamed cartilage.  Mean (SD) are expressed as the number of values (of a total of 88 measurements) that are between 50 and 90 ms. A value =<4.4 is considered normal (can be attained by chance). Values above 4.4 are considered pathological.

Due to bacterial invasion, excessive maturation of granulation tissue, poor abrasion resistance of new epithelium, and coexistence of wound healing and dissolution can lead to delayed wound healing. Residual wounds rarely heal spontaneously and are prone to recurrence. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) boost tissue repair through paracrine. Many biological effectors, including IGF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-β1 have been found in MSC conditioned media (MSC-CM), and play a role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration.Our previous animal experiments have confirmed the role of MSC-CM in regulating wound inflammation, repairing damaged repair cells and promoting wound regeneration.

Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.

Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.

Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.",The Percutaneous Stem Cell Injection Delivery Effects on Neomyogenesis Pilot Study (The POSEIDON-Pilot Study),"A Phase I/II, Randomized Pilot Study of the Comparative Safety and Efficacy of Transendocardial Injection of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Versus Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Chronic Ischemic Left Ventricular Dysfunction Secondary to Myocardial Infarction",,

Treatment's safety within one year from MSC administration by measuring the number, time-frame and severity of adverse events and
Treatment's activity in terms of reduction in total number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (GEL) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

Secondary outcomes are to gain preliminary information on the efficacy of the experimental treatment in terms of combined MRI activity and clinical efficacy (incidence of relapses and disability progression).",Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells for MS: a Phase 2 Proof of Concept Study,MEsenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for CAnadian MS Patients,,

BA incidence is estimated to range from 1:5000 to 1:19000 live births. All patients will die due to complications of liver cirrhosis if the operation is not performed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been found as a promising therapy for liver cirrhosis in adults. Bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation was also performed successfully for children with BA. Compared to MSC isolation from bone marrow, isolating MSCs from umbilical cord (UC) tissue is a less invasive procedure.

Furthermore, UC-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for liver cirrhosis in adults and different pediatric diseases, including liver cirrhosis due to primary biliary cirrhosis. The investigators will compare the outcomes of 17 Kasai operated BA patients who receive UC-MSC transplantation to 17 BA patients who only undergo Kasai operation. Two transplantations of UC - MSCs will be performed via the hepatic artery: the first transplant will be performed at baseline, and the second one will be performed 6 months later with a dosage of 1 million MSCs per kg of body weight. The frequency and severity of the adverse events or serious adverse events associated with UC-MSC injection at 72 hours post-injection will be used to assess the safety. The efficacy of the therapy will be measured using Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score, liver function, and liver biopsy. This study would open a novel cell therapy to improve outcomes of patients with BA.",Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (UC -MSC) Transplantation for Children Suffering From Biliary Atresia,Evaluation Safety and Efficacy of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (UC -MSC) Transplantation for Children Suffering From Liver Cirrhosis Due to Biliary Atresia: A Matched Control Prospective Study,,

The World Health Organization estimates that about 210 million people have COPD. Disease-related mortality is more than 3 million, representing 5% of all deaths, 90% of this mortality being concentrated in middle- and low-income countries. COPD can be subdivided into chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Emphysema, the focus of this project, is histologically defined by the permanent increase of the distal air spaces to the terminal bronchioles associated with the destruction of the alveolar septa in the lung. Approximately two-thirds of adult men and a quarter of women (most without dysfunction) will have well-defined emphysema, but often of limited extent.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, microbicide and repair potential. Regarding COPD, several authors have concentrated efforts in the investigation of the relationship between the severity of the condition and the various sources of adult stem cells. Apparently the lungs have a high chemotactic effect in relation to adult stem cells, since several studies have evidenced a high implantation (6-20%) of stem cells derived from bone marrow, administered systemically, in the pulmonary tissue of receptors. Therefore, MSCs has been tested in different lung diseases have no effective treatment, such as pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, COPD positive results, such as reduction of fibrosis, reduction of proliferation inflammatory cells and cytokines, reduction of infectious processes and recovery of the histological changes caused by pulmonary emphysema.

Based on these findings, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic administration of bone marrow stem cells in patients with severe homogeneous emphysema and evaluating the feasibility, efficacy and safety of this procedure.",Cell Therapy Associated With Endobronchial Valve,Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy Associated With Unidirectional Endobronchial Valve in Patients With Severe Pulmonary Emphysema: A Randomized Clinical Trial,,

Each specific domain have 4 categories (from 0 to 4). For motor subscale, the score ranged from 0 to 124; Therefore,highest scores indicate more severe motor impairment. Cognitive operations are assessed by aplication of three tests: verbal fluency test, Symbol Digit modalities test and the Stroop Color Word test. For all cognitive tests, highest scores translate to better cognitive ability. Behavior assessment score is obtained by summing different items related to the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Highest scores indicate greater behavioral impairment. Functional assessment includes three scales: a functional checklist, an independence scale, and a total functional capacity assessment. The maximum score of 25 points represents greater functional capacity. The BMI (Body Mass Index) will be evaluated through the BMI profiles obtained during the treatment to evaluate the nutritional status. Will be evaluated by Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) registered throughout the study in relation to the baseline score. The total score ranges from 2 to 25, with a higher number indicating more intense ideation and greater risk. Greater lethality or potential lethality of the behavior (endorsed on the Behavior subscale) indicates increased risk. Will be evaluated through Suicidal Domain from HDS (Hamilton Depression Scale) registered throughout the study in relation to the baseline score. Scores above 25 points characterize severely ill patients depressed; scores between 18 and 24 points, moderately depressed patients; and scores between 7 and 17 points, patients with mild depression. Huntington's patients normally present MRI structural abnormalities, including cortical atrophy and structural white matter changes.

Cartilage cell therapy using autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy medicinal product. Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly and extensive two-stage procedure which is limited by the number of chondrocytes obtained by biopsy and the dedifferentiation resulting from the expansion phase. Therefore, there is a need for improvement. A new cartilage repair technique should aim at decreasing surgical trauma, lowering complexity, improving logistics and cost-effectiveness while retaining or improving clinical outcome. Direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes in vitro showed improvement of the chondrogenic phenotype of dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. In addition, preserving the pericellular matrix of chondrocytes improves cartilage formation. These chondrons (chondrocytes with their pericellular matrix) have shown improved cartilage formation when combined with allogeneic MSCs in extensive preclinical studies. The cells are mixed with fibrin cell carrier and applied to the cartilage lesion within one surgical procedure. This will reduce patient morbidity and improve patient care through immediate transplantation of a potent cell-based cartilage product.

It consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. A total lower score indicates more problems. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change Quality of Life assessed by the Emory Quality of Life (EQOL) Survey Score Change in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  Pre-treatment, Follow Up (Up to One Year) Pre-treatment, Follow Up (Up to One Year) |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  Bone marrow aspirate will be placed in 10 mL heparinized tubes and nucleated cells will be isolated with a density gradient and re-suspended in complete culture medium for plating.

Specifically, osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations).",Comparing Mesenchymal Stem Cell Counts in Unilateral vs. Bilateral Posterior Superior Iliac Spine Bone Marrow Aspiration,Comparing Mesenchymal Stem Cell Counts in Unilateral vs. Bilateral Posterior Superior Iliac Spine Bone Marrow Aspiration,,

Grading: 5~6 points for Grade A, 7~9 points for Grade B and 10~15 points for grade C;  Note:  For Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) or Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC): total bilirubin (umol/L): 17~68 is 1 point, 68~170 is 1 point, and >170 is 1 point; The Child-Pugh grading standard has been widely recognized by clinicians, and provides a specific clinical reference for the selection of treatment options for patients with liver cirrhosis and has important clinical value. Overall survival rate of participants in this study. Indicators: Alanine transaminase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT) MELD is a numerical scale, ranging from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill), used for liver transplant candidates age 12 and older. It gives each person a 'score' (number) based on how urgently he or she needs a liver transplant within the next three months.  The number is calculated by a formula using three routine lab test results:  MELD score = 3.8×ln[bilirubin (mg/dl)] + 11.2×ln(INR) + 9.6×ln[Scr(mg/dl)] + 6.4×(Cause: Bile or alcoholic 0, other 1) Bilirubin (mg/dl) = Bilirubin (μmol/L)/17.1 Scr(mg/dl) = Scr(μmol/L)/88.4 KPS score is the Karnofsky (Karen, KPS, percentile method) functional status scoring standard. The higher the score, the better the health status, and the more the patient able to tolerate the side effects of treatment, hence a better curative effect. It is generally believed that a Karnofsky score above 80 is independent, which means the patient is able to take care of himself. Karnofsky score between 50 to 70 stands for a semi-independent status, that is, the patient is semi-self-care. A score of 50 means the patients require help from others. Those with a score greater than 80 are in better postoperative state and have a longer survival period.  The lower the score, the worse the health status. If the score is less than 60, many effective anti-tumor treatments cannot be implemented.

It is a medical condition of reduced function in older adults which is associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes such as falls, disability, admission to hospital, or need for long-term care. Currently, there is no specific medical treatment of frailty. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are undifferentiated cells that self-replicated, and some may change into a particular cell type. These cells go to areas of injury due to signals released by injured cells. Upon reaching, the target tissue, MSCs repair injury by releasing growth factors and immune modulators to assist in the body's repair process. This initial study will assess the practicability of using MSCs for age-related frailty and provide information for planning a future full study of MSCs for maximizing Veteran's functional independence.",Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Age-Related Frailty,A Pilot Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as Novel Therapy for Age-Related Frailty in Veterans,,

Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.

Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.

Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.",PercutaneOus StEm Cell Injection Delivery Effects On Neomyogenesis in Dilated CardioMyopathy (The POSEIDON-DCM Study),"A Phase I/II, Randomized Pilot Study of the Comparative Safety and Efficacy of Transendocardial Injection of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Versus Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Non-ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy.",,

Co-infusion of MSC has been shown to facilitate engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) in an immunodeficient mouse model. In addition, it has been shown that infusion of third party MSC in HSC transplantation could be successfully used as treatment for grade II-IV steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.

One hundred and twenty patients with HLA-mismatched donors will be included over 6 years at multiple centers across Belgium through the transplant committee of the Belgian Hematological Society. The conditioning regimen will consist of fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI, followed by the infusion of donor HSC. Patients will be randomized 1/1 in double-blind fashion to receive or not MSC (1.5-.3.0 x106/kg) from third-party (either haploidentical family members or unrelated volunteer) donors on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression will combine tacrolimus and MMF.

In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.

Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics® umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.

Study design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.

For Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20 patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.

Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires.",UCMSCs as Front-line Approach of Treatment for Patients With aGVHD,Cytopeutics® Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (Cyto-MSC) for Patients With Grade II -IV Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease: A Phase I/II Clinical Study,,

biological,"Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or known as Covid-19 has recently become a global health emergency since it was first detected in Wuhan, the People Republic of China in December 2019. Since then, the prevalence has rapidly increased worldwide. In Indonesia, by the end of April 2020, around 10,000 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19 infection, with a case fatality rate of around 8%.

The pathogenesis of Covid-19 is still under investigation and to our understanding, ACE2 receptors in the alveoli serve as the binding site of the S-protein of envelope spike virus of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 enzyme aids the fusion between cell membrane and capsid of the virus, allowing penetration of virus into the cell. Vesicles containing virion fuse with cell membrane and released as new virions. Cytopathic effect of the virus and its ability to overcome immune response determines the degree of infection.

Differences in immunological profile among degrees of severity of Covid-19 may vary especially for the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia-inhibiting factors (LIF), immunological markers such as CXCR3+CD4+, CXCR3+CD8+ T cell and CXCR3+ NK cells, implying the ongoing cytokine storm. The previous studies also found increasing number for infection markers such as procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. The decreasing number of anti-inflammatory cytokines in such as IL-10 also supports this finding.

Previous studies have shown immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory capacity of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs contributed to the shifting of pro-inflammatory Th2 into anti-inflammatory Th2. One of the most recent study on the usage of MSCs on Covid-19 patients showed increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which give rise to inhibitory effect of T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell population. Vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is found increasing following MSCs administration, which indicates the ability to improve the disrupted capillaries due to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The ability of MSCs in differentiating to alveolar cells is proven by the presence of SPM and SPC2, surfactant proteins produced by type II alveolar cells.

To compare the effect and safety of autologous transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) and mononuclear cells(MNCs) on Diabetic patients with Critical Limb Ischemia and Foot Ulcer.

Methods:

patients were randomized into the A group and the B group by use of a randomization table. One lower limb in A group or in B group was selected randomly for MSCs or MNCs transplantation as MSCs or MNCs group, the other lower limb in the same patient was selected for placebo（normal saline ,NS）injection as NS group.

The whole procedures of this clinical trial were blinded to both patients and investigators.Patients in both groups received the same ordinary treatment. Meanwhile, MSCs and MNCs were transplanted into the impaired lower limbs respectively. Follow-up index include: efficacy (pain,ulcer healing rate, lower limb amputation rate and ,ankle-brachial index,Transcutaneous oxygen pressure,magnetic resonance angiography) and safety (infection of the injection site, immunological rejection, and tumour generation).",Comparison of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Mononuclear Cells on Diabetic Critical Limb Ischemia and Foot Ulcer,Comparison of Autologous Transplantation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Mononuclear Cells on Diabetic Critical Limb Ischemia and Foot Ulcer,,

Among ischemic heart diseases, myocardial infarction has specific significance because the cardiac muscle does not have sufficient and adequate capacity to regenerate; therefore, necrosis of a region leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. Infarction can lead to a progressive and irreversible decrease in cardiac function, resulting in heart failure (HF) syndrome, depending on the area affected by this scar, via a ventricular remodeling mechanism.

In recent years, HF has been revealed as a major public health problem due to its incidence and its social, economic and especially human impact, as it represents a serious limitation of the quality of life of individuals. The prevalence of HF in the general population of the United States and the United Kingdom is approximately 1%, and in those older than 75 years, the prevalence varies between 5 and 10%. Regarding its prognosis, recent data from the Framingham Study indicate that at 5 years, the mortality rate of HF is 75% in men and 62% in women; the mean mortality rate of all cancers is 50%.

The molecular basis of congestive HF is the absence of cardiac cells capable of regenerating the heart muscle. Despite the publication of recent studies suggesting the existence of stem cells capable of regenerating cardiomyocytes destroyed because of myocardial infarction, in humans, the capacity of these cells is insufficient to replace the cells destroyed due to necrosis secondary to ischemia.

In recent years, the accumulation of results derived from preclinical studies has allowed the development of the first clinical trials of the feasibility and safety of cardiac regeneration using cellular therapy. Several studies have shown that t cells exist in adult bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and, more recently, multipotent stem cells (MAPC), with the ability to differentiate into endothelial tissue and cardiac muscle, which can contribute to the regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function in animal infarction models. However, cell therapy research has moved rapidly toward the use of more undifferentiated cells rather than hematopoietic lineages, such as mesenchymal cells. These cells can be obtained from different sources, with a tendency toward the use of characterized allogeneic cells, which are immediately available in the potential recipient. Given that this type of therapy has not been rigorously investigated in Latin America, we aim to determine the effect of therapy using Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells (WJ-MSCs) from the human umbilical cord on neomyogenesis in patients with previous myocardial infarction who are undergoing open revascularization. Our hospital has some experience with regenerative therapy, both in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic infarction, with encouraging results that support this new phase of inter-institutional research.

Objective: To evaluate the safety and estimate the effect of coronary revascularization accompanied by intramyocardial injection of WJ-MSCs and the placement of an extracellular matrix patch seeded with WJ-MSCs compared to coronary revascularization accompanied by injection of culture medium without the presence of WJ-MSC and placement of an extracellular matrix patch without seeding with WJ-MSC on global and regional cardiac function, myocardial viability and the incidence of adverse effects determined as ventricular arrhythmias.",Randomized Study of Coronary Revascularization Surgery With Injection of WJ-MSCs and Placement of an Epicardial Extracellular Matrix,Randomized Study as Proof of Concept of Coronary Revascularization Surgery With Injection of Wharton's Jelly-derived Mesenchymal Cells and Placement of an Epicardial Extracellular Matrix Patch Seeded With WJ-MSCs in Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy,,

For example, stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist produces electrical activity that travels along the sensory pathway on its way to the brain. This activity can be recorded with electrodes positioned along that pathway. Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) The NBSS was designed as an objective and validated way to assess bladder symptoms in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction as a result of spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and spinal bifida. The NBSS consists of 24 questions. The first question classifies patients by bladder management, but does not make up part of the numeric score. The remaining questions address 3 domains: incontinence, storage and voiding, and consequences. The final question is an overall quality of life question. The total score can range from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 74 (maximum symptoms). The Adult Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score¹, also known as the Adult NBD score has been designed to help healthcare professionals evaluate the effectiveness of their patient's current bowel management routine by assessing the impact it has on the patient's quality of life. By having your patients answer 10 simple questions, the Adult NBD Score can help identify and quantify severity of bowel dysfunction in the adult patients. The Adult NBD score consists of 10 questions and is a symptom-score where each symptom is weighted based on its impact on quality of life. The scores from each question are added together and a total score is calculated. The maximum score is 47 while minimum is 0. Score Severity of bowel dysfunction 0-6 Very minor 7-9 Minor 10-13 Moderate 14+ Severe Composition in reference to normal laboratory values. Patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the spine and the spinal cord with and without contrast. The relationship of adverse events to study drug will be graded into the following categories: probable, possible, unlikely, unrelated. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in sensory and motor function following completion of treatment as measured by Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs) change in Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) change in Neurogenic Bowel Symptom Score Incidence of abnormal CSF composition Number of subjects who develop a new pathologic mass at the spinal cord area of injection or anywhere along the spinal cord.

However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with permanent end ileostomy.

The investigator will enroll 40 subjects with T2DM who are only on metformin. The study consists of 4 visits to the GW MFA, including screening visit. Subjects will be recruited from across the DMV area, and prescreened over the phone or in clinic, and then invited for an in-person screening visit at the GW MFA to determine eligibility. If eligible, subject will be enrolled into one of two study Arms, active semaglutide 1 mg or Placebo. This study will include an up titration of study drug. From week 0-4 subject will be on 0.25 mg/week, from week 5-8 subject will take 0.5mg/week, and week 9 to 24 subject will take 1 mg/week of Semaglutide or Placebo.

During the regular 3 visits subject will have their vital measured, body composition assessed using Tanita scale, arterial stiffness measured and blood drawn for EPC cells analysis and standard of care labs. At visit 1 and visit 3, fat biopsy will be done on the belly area to acquire 2-3 grams of fat tissue. Screening will take place at week -2, Visit1 at week 0, Visit 2 at week 8, Visit 3 at week 24.

Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.

Summarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.

Current treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease.",Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell(UC-MSC)Delayed Renal Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD3、4 ),"A Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Clinical Study of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell(UC-MSC)Delayed Renal Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD3、4 )",,

The Geriatric Depression Scale Short form (GDS-SF) is a 15-item screening tool that is used to identify depression in older adults. Answers indicating depression are in bold and italicized; score one point for each bold one selected. A score of 0 to 5 is normal. A score greater than 5 suggests depression and requires evaluation, whereas a score of 10 or greater would require evaluation for treatment .

Dose limiting toxicity definition: For this study, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined as any grade ≥3 adverse reaction AND attributable to γMSCs (attribution listed as at least probable), occurring from γMSC infusion through the day of hematopoietic engraftment or 21 days of transplant, whichever is later. The maximal tolerated dose will be the dose at which 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 subjects demonstrates a DLT.

Relapse and death prior to neutrophil engraftment are considered competing risks for the endpoint of primary graft failure. Secondary graft failure is defined as initial donor-derived neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to < 500/μL for fourteen consecutive measurements on different days, and unresponsive to growth factor therapy, with loss of donor chimerism to < 50%. Platelet engraftment is defined as the first day of a minimum of three consecutive measurements on different days such that the patient has achieved a platelet count > 20,000/μL and > 50,000/μL with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of the three measurements will be designated as the day of platelet engraftment. The event is death in continuous remission treating relapse as the competing risk. Patients alive and in remission at the time of last observation will be censored. Incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD will be measured according to Revised Glucksberg criteria. Incidence of chronic GvHD will be scored according to the recent NIH scoring. Disease-free survival is defined as the minimum time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease, to death or to last follow-up. Primary cause of death will be classified as:  Relapse/Primary disease: If the patient relapsed/progressed after day 0 prior to death, the primary cause of death is relapse/progression, even if they subsequently developed GvHD, organ toxicities or infections that may have contributed to subsequent death. GvHD: Death from acute or chronic GvHD, in the absence of relapse or disease progression.  Infection: Death from documented viral, bacterial or fungal infections in the absence of GvHD or relapse/disease progression.  Organ toxicity: Death from major organ toxicities not attributable to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/MDS, infection or GvHD.  Other: Any other causes of death. Testing for recurrent malignancy in the blood, marrow or other sites will be used to assess relapse after transplantation. For the purpose of this study, relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or MDS and including minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL consistent with pre-transplant features. The event for this endpoint is the time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease or to last follow-up. Death in remission is considered a competing risk. If a patient is enrolled on the study but does not start protocol treatment, a study exit form must be submitted documenting the reason for not starting protocol treatment. Such a subject will not be considered evaluable. Viral activations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will be documented. For the purpose of the study viral activation is defined as any polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay result considered positive by Laboratory Medicine which may or may not lead to the initiation of antiviral therapy as per institutional guidelines. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Primary graft failure Secondary graft failure Platelet engraftment Non-relapse mortality (NRM) Change in Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) Incidence Change in Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) Incidence Disease-free survival (DFS) Primary cause of death Relapse Early discontinuation Viral activation |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  Up to Year 2 Up to Year 2 Up to Year 2 Up to Year 2 Day 30, Day 100 Day 30, Day 100, Day 180, Day 365 Up to Year 2 Up to Year 2 Up to Year 2 Up to Year 2 Up to Day 100 | ",All,Over 1 Year,Phase 1,45.0,OTHER,Interventional, , ,"December 2, 2021",August 2023,August 2023,"March 30, 2020",,"July 19, 2022",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT04328714," interferon γ-primed mesenchymal stromal cells as prophylaxis for acute graft v host disease interferon γ-primed mesenchymal stromal cells as prophylaxis for acute graft v host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients with hematologic malignancies and myelodysplasia drug: interferon gamma (ifnγ)-primed human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells drug: interferon gamma (ifnγ)-primed human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells sequential assignment this study uses a rolling 6 dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. accrual in the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum dose tolerated has been determined in adults. d000000970 d000000998 d000000890 antineoplastic agents antiviral agents anti-infective agents adult population pediatric population infe aneo all anti-infective agents antineoplastic agents all drugs and chemicals inhibitor details m9559 m9558 m3466 m3366 interferons interferon-gamma antiviral agents anti-infective agents high high low low to determine the maximal dose, initially adult subjects will receive a single infusion of third party, freshly ex vivo expanded, ifnγ-primed mscs at a dose of 2 x 106 cells/kg of ideal body weight on day +1 (the day after infusion of the hematopoietic cell graft). the dose will be escalated to 5 x 106 and then 10 x 106 cells/kg. in absence of any dose limiting toxicity, 10 x 106 cells/kg will be accepted as the maximal dose.  subsequent participants in the adult and pediatric cohorts will receive the maximal dose as determined by the initial adult participants.  participants will receive the infusion in an inpatient setting. mscs will be intravenously infused through a central line or a large bore peripheral iv using standard blood product tubing within 4 hours of release. the product will be infused by iv push or syringe pump over approximately 30-60 minutes or to gravity depending on product volume. d000007372 d000007371 interferons interferon-gamma interferon gamma (ifnγ)-primed human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells  drug",The protocol is a phase I open label study evaluating the safety and feasibility of peri-transplant infusion of freshly expanded interferon gamma primed MSCs in adult and pediatric patients undergoing HCT for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).,Interferon γ-Primed Mesenchymal Stromal Cells as Prophylaxis for Acute Graft v Host Disease,Interferon γ-Primed Mesenchymal Stromal Cells as Prophylaxis for Acute Graft v Host Disease After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies and Myelodysplasia,,

A modified Bayesian continual reassessment method (mCRM) will be used. At each visit patients will be assigned a RECIST visit response of CR, PR, SD or PD depending on the status of their disease compared to baseline and previous assessments.

The number of patients experiencing each AE will be summarised by the CTCAE grade. The number and percentage of patients with adverse events in different categories (eg, causally related, CTCAE grade ≥3 etc) will be summarised by dose group, and events in each category will be further summarised. Tumour response data will be summarised using the following response categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD) and Non-Evaluable (NE).  Waterfall plots (bar charts) indicating the percentage change from baseline in sum of the diameters of target lesions (TLs) may be produced depending on how much data is obtained in patients with measurable disease at baseline. These may be individual patient plots of changes in tumour size over time or dose level plots with the best percentage change per patient displayed.

In the phase I study, patients will receive cisplatin and pemetrexed on day one followed by MSCTRAIL cells on day 2. This constitutes one cycle of treatment. Each patient will receive 3 cycles of treatment at 21 day intervals. The aim of phase 1 is to estimate the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MSCTRAIL in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy.

During the phase II study patients will be randomised to either the intervention or the control arm of the study. All patients in both arms will receive cisplatin and pemetrexed on day one of treatment. Patients randomised to the intervention arm will receive the recommended dose of MSCTRAIL from Phase I on day 2 whilst those in the control arm will receive a placebo.

The REBORNE scale is an ad-hoc and validated scale, developed by Gomez-Barrena et al. (article currently under preparation) as a modification of the RUST score (Whelan, 2010; Journal of Trauma). In the REBORNE scale, the presence/absence of radiological consolidation is evaluated on a total of 4 cortices. Score range from 0 (no bone callus visible) to 4 (callus present with same density as cortical). The total score will be recorded. To compare level of pain (by Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) between the experimental arms and the comparator.  The NRS is a scale that rates the patient´s pain from 0-10 (0= no pain, 10= worst pain), at the time of the visit. To compare the rate of complications between the experimental arms and the comparator To compare the health status (by using the Short Form-36 Health Questionnaire) between treatment arms.  The SF-36 questionnaire is a validated, widely used patient-reported health survey which measures their physical and mental health status. It consists of 36 questions organized in 8 dimensions.

The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. An additional advantage is that they can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. These cells have already been tested in several clinical trials with an excellent safety record.

The objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be cell-treated while the remaining 20 patients will be injected with a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care.

The feasibility of the project is supported by the expertise of the Meary Cell and Gene Therapy Center, which is approved for the production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and has already successfully prepared the first batches of cells, as well as by the involvement of a cardiac surgery team which will leverage its experience with stem cells for the treatment of heart failure to make it relevant to the Stroma-Cov-2 project.",Cell Therapy Using Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS,Cell Therapy Using Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS,,

Rods and cones largely depend on the retinal pigment epithelium for their proper functioning. Various growth factors and their receptors are present in retinal epithelium and a number of genes are responsible for the production of these growth factors. Genetic mutation in any of these genes causes retinal degeneration by progressive loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. The disease initially starts with night blindness and leads to the loss of central vision and eventually total blindness. To date, there is no definitive cure for patients suffering from RP. Recently, stem cell based therapies have shown great promise for the management of RP. It is well documented that umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have the ability to release various paracrine and immunomodulatory factors that are similar to those synthesized by retinal pigment epithelium. Multiple routes including systemic (intravenous) and localized (subretinal, intravitreal, suprachoroidal and sub-tenon) have been employed to administer UMSCs for the management of RP. It is important to note that deep sub-tenon region (space between the sclera and the conjunctiva) acts as both natural culture medium for cells and as immune privileged site because of avascularity of the region. It has been reported that the injection of UMSCs in sub-tenon space of human subjects have improved the visual acuity even after 1 year post-injection. In addition, the injection of UMSCs in suprachoroidal space enhances the entry of growth factors released by the cells into choroidal flow and maintain the constant growth factors secretion to the choroidal and retinal tissues. Limoli and colleagues were the first to report the suprachoroidal administration of cells being the safe mode of cell delivery with no complications. The present study is aimed to investigate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of UMSC injection employing two different routes (sub-tenon injection versus suprachoroidal injection) for the treatment of RP in human subjects.",Investigation of Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of UMSCs for the Management of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP),Investigation of Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UMSCs) for the Management of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP),,

The option for surgical treatments based on the size and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency, drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.

The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial, involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24 months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI.",Efficacy of Allogeneic UCMSCs for Treating Large Defects Knee Injury,Phase IIb Study Assessing the Efficacy of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Knee Cartilage Injury,,

Identification and assessment of the severity of non-motor symptoms is carried out using Non-motor Symptoms Questionnaire (PD NMS Questionnaire).A score of 30 represents the worst result with a score of zero representing (no disability). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is used to assess sleep quality over the last month.The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is used to measure daytime sleepiness.The ESS score can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'. We use the Hamilton Depression Scale - Hamilton psychiatric rating scale for depression (HDRS) - to identify signs of depression. A score of 52 represents the worst result with a score of zero representing (no disability). |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  motor symptoms change non-motor symptoms change sleep quality change daytime sleepiness change signs of depression change |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  3 month 3 month 3 month 3 month 3 month |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:   |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:   |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:   | ",All,18 Years - 69 Years,Phase 2 Phase 3,50.0,OTHER,Interventional, , ,"July 1, 2017","December 1, 2021","December 31, 2021","October 18, 2019",,"March 3, 2021",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT04146519, parkinson's disease therapy using cell technology developent and implement a method of parkinson's disease therapy using cell technology biological: autologous mesenchymal stem cells other: placebo parallel assignment    study group control group phsol all pharmaceutical solutions all drugs and chemicals  m21013 pharmaceutical solutions low autologous mesenchymal stem cells saline solution   autologous mesenchymal stem cells placebo  biological other,"Treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease using mesenchymal stem cells is a perspective method to influence on the pathogenesis of the disease.

Poor healing of the incision will increase the patient's pain and prolong the patient's hospital stay, and the choice of wound treatment is closely related to the wound healing effect. Mesenchymal stem cells mainly rely on paracrine effects to exert their therapeutic effects and obtain better therapeutic effects in wound healing.

Quality of life evolution includes global assessment by the patient and the physician.  The global assessment by the patient and the physician involves evaluation of: - Overall pain intensity in the lumbar spine (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = extreme); - patient's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor); - physician's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor).

VAS pain scale ranges from 0 to 100: where 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable. In brief, the patients will fill VAS tests indicating the amount of pain experienced at rest and in motion. For this the investigators will assign each of the patients to one of 4 categories designated as ""employable"" which included those who were unemployed due to pain, employed but on sick leave, laid off, or working. The other categories include retired, disabled, and elderly at least 60 years of age, eligible for social security. Evolution of affected disc(s) by quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) density measurements in T2 and T1 spin/echo and T1 rho weighted images used as an indication of disc fluid and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) content. The ""quality"" of the patient's lumbar disc/discs will be monitored non invasively using T2 weighted MRI sagittal images and, in T1 spin/echo MRI. Lumbar disc grading will be performed in the sagittal T2 weighted images by two physicians independently who were experienced in MRI of the spine. They will review each intervertebral disc from L1-2 to L5-S1 by the modified Pfirrmann criteria. The modified Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade 1 to 8 for disc degeneration. The investigators will compare the medical and non-medical costs between the two groups of patient. For this purpose, resource use in each arm will be collected in physical units in the eCRF (electronic case report form) at the clinical centre as follows:  Acute care medical hospitalisations related to IDD Acute care surgical hospitalisations related to IDD Rehabilitation hospitalisations related to IDD Analgesics Work disruption Evaluation of changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) through the measurement of weight (kg) and height (m) of each subject enrolled in the study. The investigators will assess the percentage of patients who will develop haematological disorders. For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine haematological parameters (haematocrit, haemoglobin, RBC, WBC) to monitor the physiological status of the patient. The investigators will assess the incidence of disorders related to coagulation. For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine coagulation parameters (INR, PTT) to monitor the coagulation status and hemostasis risks of each subject. The investigators will evaluate the incidence of metabolic alteration in patients recruited. For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine biochemical parameters (Electrolytes, Creatinine, ALT, AST, AP, Bilirubin) to monitor the metabolic function of liver and kidney. Blood sampling will be used to determine the concentration of C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to monitor inflammatory response in each subject. Participants will undergo to urinalysis which consists in routine urine tests for the semiquantitative assessment of urinary characteristics to monitor the physiological status of the subjects. Participants will undergo to spine examination for the identification of relevant clinical signs. The clinicians will evaluate: abnormalities in gait (pattern of walking); spinal range of motion (eg, bend forward); posture and spinal alignment (such as scoliosis or kyphosis).

This is dangerous because the spinal cord contains cells which control one's ability to move their legs and walk, and also to be able to urinate and have bowel movements normally. One of the current treatments for fetal MMC is to perform a surgery on the fetus before it is born which has many names including in utero surgery, prenatal surgery, or fetal surgery. This is a surgery that occurs inside the uterus (the womb) where the surgeon closes the opening in your fetus' back to cover the exposed spinal cord.

Researchers have found that adding stem cells to the repair is effective in improving the ability of animals with MMC to walk, and that the stem cells are safe in animal studies. These stem cells are thought to protect the cells in the spinal cord that control movement and developmental outcomes. This study is being performed to look at the safety and effectiveness of stem cells on the fetus's exposed spinal cord during prenatal surgery.",Cellular Therapy for In Utero Repair of Myelomeningocele - The CuRe Trial,Phase 1/2a Trial of Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Repair of Fetal Myelomeningocele,,

i) Determine dose safety of ORBCEL-C (selected Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human umbilical cord) ii) Evaluate treatment activity through assessment of biomarkers

This trial has two main stages:

Stage 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered by observing for occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
Stage 2 will use the maximum tolerated dose found in stage 1 to and further determine safety and activity outcomes of ORBCEL-C.

Upon completion of this trial we hope to be able to justify and conduct separate, larger scale trials using ORBCEL-C.","A Single-arm,Phase IIa,Safety and Efficacy Trial of Selected MSCs in the Treatment of Patients With PSC & AiH","An Adaptive,Multicentre, Phase IIa, Multi-disease Trial Investigating the Safety & Activity of a Single Infusion of Selected Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the Treatment of Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis & Autoimmune Hepatitis",,

Conventional therapeutic approach includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new opportunities for development of the same.

MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue.14

As limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been undertaken to explore the tolerability & effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC in second treatment arm in IPF patients.

The purpose of this research study is to determine if the infusion of a combination of stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same patient will contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in patients with symptomatic severe coronary ischemia(CI).

In this trial we will determine whether the combination stem cell treatment is safe, feasible and results in the development of mature stable and/or collateral vessels and improvement of cardiac function.

Coronary Ischemia (CI) is intractable angina due to severe coronary artery disease which can seriously decrease blood flow to the heart.

CI needs a comprehensive treatment since the condition will not improve on its own. The overall goal of the treatment is to increase blood flow to the heart and improve symptoms of angina.

The study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and unable to provide appropriate blood supply to the heart.

Patients eligible to participate in this study are those suffering from severe blockages of the vessels of the heart and are not candidates for percutaneous revascularization or surgical procedures.",Phase II Combination Stem Cell Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Coronary Ischemia(CI),Phase II Study for the Transfer of Bone Marrow-Derived Mononuclear and Mesenchymal StemCells Into the Myocardium for the Treatment of Severe Coronary Ischemia,,

Maximal score is 24 and higher scores represent worse function The knee society score is divided into four parts: it consists of the ''Symptoms''(25 points), the ''Patient satisfaction''(40 points), the ''Patient expectation''(15 points) and the ''Functional activities''(100 points). Each part will be evaluated separately.Higher scores indicate better knee score/satisfaction/functioning or higher expectations. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Cartilage repair Change in MOS item short from health survey(SF-36) Change in Lequesne Index Change in knee society score (KSS) |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  From before randomization until 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment start.

Patients with spine problems often need surgeries that include fusion (bony healing) of vertebrae (bones in your back) together in order to hold the bones steady allowing them to heal together (fusion). If the vertebrae (back bones) fail to heal together, which occurs about 10-15% of the time, it can result in a slower recovery and may require revision (another) surgery. By using a small portion of the graft taken during surgery the investigators hope to define the cells that make bone most efficiently.

Improving implantation rates in ICSI cycles has been the focus of research in recent decades. Because success rates is not satisfactory enough especially when transferring good embryos to the uterine cavity and pregnancy does not occur. Trying to improve endometrial receptivity, the investigators have thought about stem cell therapy as stem cells have played a pivotal role in regenerative medicine in many pathologies as myocardial infarction, Diabetes Mellitus and spinal cord injuries.

Garget and Healy reported in 2011 treatment of a case with Asherman's syndrome by administration of bone marrow stem cells in the uterine cavity. Endometrial growth and improved vascularity has been observed by ultrasound follow-up and Doppler study of endometrial blood flow. Endometrial regeneration has been enough to support pregnancy through successful IVF trial.

The investigators have succeeded in previous work to isolate MSC from placental tissue and differentiate it to endometrium-like cells. The investigators compared the differentiation ability of placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Wharton Jelly derived MSC to differentiate to endometrium under 3 different culture conditions: endometrium conditioned medium (ECM), follicular fluid (FF) conditioned medium and medium containing both. The investigators found that placental MSC has better differentiating ability to endometrium especially under culture conditions containing both ECM and FF as evidenced by prominent appearance of glandular pattern and expression of progesterone receptors in differentiated cells.

Therefore the investigators need to direct this study and test the effect of placental derived MSC in improving implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure, unresponsive endometrium to ovulation induction drugs or with endometrial atrophy or advanced maternal age planning for ICSI trial.

Patients and Methods:

60 patients attending Kasr El-Aini assisted reproduction unit and private IVF center will be randomized to three groups by computer generated programs:

The first group, patients randomized to receive differentiated stem cell therapy:

After ovum pick-up, MSC differentiated to endometrium is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter. Embryo transfer will be done at day 5 at the blastocyst stage to allow enough time for endometrial regeneration and increased endometrial receptivity.

The second group, patients randomized to receive undifferentiated stem cell therapy:

Immediately postmenstrual undifferentiated MSC is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter to allow enough time for the MSC to differentiate as it needs 7-10 days for differentiation. Ovum pick-up will be done as usual while all other steps will be the same including embryo transfer which will be done at day 5.

The third group, control group:

The mortality was as high as 20% -40%. Due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments, supporting treatment is the predominant therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Its cure is essentially dependent on the patient's immunity. While the immune system eliminates the virus, numerous inflammatory cytokines are produced and a cytokine storm occurs in severe cases.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in injury repair and immune regulation, showing advantageous prospects in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. MSCs prevent cytokine storms by retarding the TNF-α pathway, alleviate sepsis by modulating macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, DC cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. After infused, MSCs aggregate in the lungs, improve the lung microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelia, and improve pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary function.",Safety and Effectiveness of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Pneumonia of Coronavirus Disease 2019,Safety and Effectiveness of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Pneumonia of Coronavirus Disease 2019,,

They are undifferentiated ""blank"" cells that do not yet have a specific function. Under proper conditions, they begin to develop into specialized tissue and organs. They are self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. They serves as a sort of repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish other cells as long as the person is still alive. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility and elevated serum gonadotropins. POF occurs in 1 % of women. In majority of cases the underlying cause is not identified. Management essentially involves hormone replacement and infertility treatment.

SVF have the potential to facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing. The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.

In addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.

MSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19 Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective.

The methods to treat SCI patients in sequela stage update are poor. Though traditional rehabilitation therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, its effect to improve the neurological disorders of these patients, such as the dysfunction of sense, motor, autologous adjustment of blood pressure control of urination and defecation, perspiration , etc. is unsatisfying. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function. Studies show that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can remarkably improve the neurological function of SCI in animals without any severe side effect.

In this study, the investigators use mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord to treat 40 SCI patients (20 cases in early stage and 20 cases in sequela stage). The investigators also follow-up ten patients who only receive rehabilitation and another ten outpatients who accept neither stem cell therapy nor rehabilitation. On this basis, the investigators can compare the efficacy of these two treatments.",Difference Between Rehabilitation Therapy and Stem Cells Transplantation in Patients With Spinal Cord Injury in China,Efficacy Difference Between Rehabilitation Therapy and Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation in Patients With Acute or Chronic Spinal Cord Injury in China,,

Adult (18-60 years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from refractory epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included in this study. The pts were randomized to the standard treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (control group, 30 pts) or anti-epileptic drugs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (study group, 30 pts). The pts in the study group received one intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded MSCs (40-101 x 106 cells) and one subsequent endolumbal injection of neuroinduced MSCs (2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cells). Both the unfavorable reactions to MSC infusions and the clinical effects, including complications, were examined. The unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS; i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia).The possible beneficial effects of therapy in the two groups of pts were examined based on clinical observations and electroencephalography measurements (prior and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy). To determine potential changes in disease progression, the signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and particularly, changes in seizure character and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The main points of disease monitoring were ""yes"" or ""no"" responses (to therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to evaluate electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves based on standard and additional criteria. The paroxismality index, the peak frequency of EEG activity, the index of slow activity, and the summarized points of EEG pathology signs were calculated for each patient. All assessments were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to identify the potential differences between the two pts groups. Therapy was terminated when immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed.

SARS-CoV-2 works like a hijacker (hackers), sabotaging communication between cells so that the immune system, like T-cells, kills not only infected cells but also healthy cells. This dysregulation results in hyper-inflammation which cause damage to organs, not just the lungs. This is the cause of the high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.

Exosomes are vesicles with a size of 30-100 nanometers originating from within cells that function to communicate with other cells. Exosomes are transport containers that contain bioactive cargo: such as proteins, genetic material, and various other molecules. These containers move from cells of origin, flowing through blood vessels or other body fluids to target cells. Exosomes penetrate the cell membrane and act on various organelles within the target cell.

All cell types can produce exosomes. What differentiates them is the cargo they contain. The exosome produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contains bioactive cargo derived from mesenchymal stem cells, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, messengerRNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). The target cells are immune system cells, infected cells and progenitor cells from infected organs. On target immune cells, the anti-inflammatory cytokines work as immunomodulators to relieve hyper-inflammation. In infected cells, the miRNAs work to prevent viral replication by inhibiting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA (viral mRNA silencing and degrading). In lung progenitor cells and other infected organs, the growth factors work to stimulate protein synthesis processes that function for organ regeneration.

This study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) clinical trial with two arms: one intervention arm, and one control arm. The EXOSOME-MSC will be tested as adjuvant, on top of standard COVID-19 drugs. It will be injected to participants via intravenous route twice, in day-1 and day-7 of 14 days of study participation.",Efficacy and Safety of EXOSOME-MSC Therapy to Reduce Hyper-inflammation In Moderate COVID-19 Patients,Efficacy and Safety of EXOSOME-MSC (Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes) Therapy to Reduce Hyper-inflammation In Moderate COVID-19 (2019- New Corona Virus Disease) Patients,,

Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studies clinically.

Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach.

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be grown from bone marrow provided by healthy volunteers. Volunteer bone marrow donors for BMSCs are generally required to meet the same healthy history and infectious disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood donors. BMSCs are being used to treat a number of immune system and cardiovascular disorders, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), heart disease, and vascular disease. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center is interested in collecting bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to produce clinical-grade BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients.
This study will also collect bone marrow from autologous donors (donors who will later receive their own BMSCs) for further treatment.

Objectives:

- To collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy subjects and autologous donors in order to produce BMSCs.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who are either healthy volunteers or individuals who will need to receive their own BMSCs.

Design:

Prospective healthy volunteers will be asked a series of questions designed to identify exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C, or other transfusion-transmitted diseases. A blood sample will be collected and tested for the abovementioned diseases and for other problems that may prevent bone marrow donation.
Prospective autologous donors will also have blood tests to evaluate their own suitability for bone marrow donation.
Eligible participants will be scheduled to provide a marrow aspirate/biopsy, taken from the upper part of the thigh bone, using standard bone marrow donation techniques.
The collected bone marrow will be processed into BMSCs at the National Institutes of Health.",Collection of Bone Marrow From Healthy Volunteers and Patients for the Production of Clinical Bone Marrow Stromal Cell (BMSC) Products,Collection of Bone Marrow From Healthy Volunteers and Patients for the Production of Clinical Bone Marrow Stromal Cell (BMSC) Products,,

This is a study for patients who have respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that have not gotten better. Because there is no standard treatment for this infection, patients are being asked to volunteer for a gene transfer research study using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

Stem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific function in the body. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown from bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of bones). Stem cells can develop into other types of more mature (specific) cells, such as blood and muscle cells.

The purpose of this study is to see if MSCs versus controls can help to treat respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.",Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for the Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Induced Acute Respiratory Failure (COVID-19 Disease),"Single Donor Banked Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for the Treatment of COVID-19 Induced ARDS: A Non-Blinded Randomized, Controlled Study",,

X-ray will be performed for both knees at Screening Visit, while only for the target knee at the other scheduled visits. Change from baseline in the synovial fluid analysis of the target knee at Week 52, if the subject's knee is suitable for arthrocentesis per investigator's judgment.  The volume of synovial fluid aspiration will be determined by the investigator and will be recorded in the CRF. The appearance, white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils will be examined. Percentage of subjects using the rescue medication(s) during Visit 3 to Visit 7 and Visit 3 to Visit 8.  Subjects are allowed to take acetaminophen and/or designated NSAID as rescue medicine to reduce the pain when needed. The acceptable NSAIDs are Etoricoxib and Celebrex. The maximum oral doses for acetaminophen, Etoricoxib, and Celebrex are ≤ 2000 mg/day, ≤ 120 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively, while the topical use of these three rescue medications is allowed at any dose levels. The incidence of adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE). All AEs will be assessed for severity by the investigator based on NCI-CTCAE v5.0. Further, the investigator will judge if the AE is IP-related. Refer to Section 8.4 for details of AE definition and reporting. Changes from baseline at each post-treatment visit in vital signs. Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature. Respiratory rate, pulse rate, and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) will be obtained after the subject has been at rest for at least 5 minutes in a sitting position. Vital signs will be performed before and one hour after the Chondrochymal® or HA administration. Changes from baseline at each post-treatment visit in laboratory examination.  Laboratory tests to be measured in this study will consist of the following:  Hematology: WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and international normalized ratio (INR, Screening only). Biochemistry: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (screening only). Abnormal findings in physical examination.

The MOCART classification is one of the most frequently used MR score for postoperative cartilage repair tissue evaluation. The MOCART score is a 9-part and 29-item scoring system, also resulting in a final cartilage repair tissue score between 0 and 100 points; 0 points represent the worst imaginable score, 100 points represent the best imaginable score. The MOS SF-36, It is a generic scale to evaluate health/disease status. It comprises 36 items divided into two components: Physical Health (PH) and Mental Health (MH). PH includes four subscales: Physical Function (PF), Role Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), and General Health (GH). MH includes four subscales: Vitality (V), Social functioning (SF), Role Emotional (RE), and General Health (GH).  Each component (PH and MH) and each of the eight subscale scores are transformed into a 0-to-100 scale. Higher scores represent better health status The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) evaluates functional limitations related to foot and ankle issues. Consist in 42 items that cover 5 dimensions: Symptoms (S: 7 items), Pain (P: 9 items), Activities of Daily Living (ADL: 17 items), Sport and Recreation Activities (SRA: 5 items), and foot and ankle related Quality of Life (QoL: 4 items). Raw scores of each sub-scales results of the sum of each item score.  These raw scores are standardised into a 0 to 100 scale; higher scores mean higher dysfunction due to foot/ankle condition. The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale aims to evaluate overtime changes in the functionality of the same patient in musculoskeletal ankle and foot pathology. It is a survey that consists of 21 items about activities of daily living, and 8 items about sports skills.  Raw scores of each sub-scales are standardised into a 0 to 100 scale; higher scores mean higher dysfunction due to foot/ankle condition. Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS-Pain): a pain rating scale based on self-reported measures of symptoms. A 10cm line numbered from 0 to 10 represents a continuum between ""no pain"" (zero) and ""worst pain"" (ten).  It can also be interpreted as a 0-to-100 points score. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change on tissue reparation quality Change over time of general health status Change over time of functional limitations of foot and ankle.

The LOC can be an important source of pain and affects comparatively younger, working age and athletically active patients.

Although there are several therapeutic strategies, debridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically are the most frequent procedures. After this surgery, it is expected that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Though good results have been reported, this fibrocartilage presents histological characteristics of lower quality to those of the native articular cartilage.

Based on previous studies in different joints, it is hypothesized that the augmentation treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal allogeneic stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with debridement and microfractures only.

Therefore, the present study seeks to compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.",The Effectiveness of Adding Allogenic Stem Cells After Traditional Treatment of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Randomized, Multicentric, Prospective, Double-blind Study: Effectiveness of Adding Allogenic Stem Cells to a Platelet-poor Plasma Scaffold After Arthroscopic Debridement and Microfractures in Patients With Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus",,

A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However, it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to immune reconstitution in chronic HIV infection. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated to decrease immune responses of the host, and can suppress inflammation in HIV-infected non-responders. Here, the investigators propose a hypothesis that MSC can reduce immune activation which subsequently lead to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts dependent on dose of transfused MSCs in HIV-infected patients.",Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Immune Reconstitution in HIV-infected Patients,"Phase 2 Study of UC-MSC in Restoring CD4 T Cell Counts and Reducing Immune Activation in HIV-infected Patients Underlying Long-term Antiviral Therapy: a Multicenter, Does-escalating, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Trial.",,

This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation.

This mechanical process retains the vascular architecture, mature pericytes, and MSCs for autologous injection. Lipogems is currently FDA-approved for orthopedic and arthroscopic procedures; thus, this would be an on-label use for knee injections.

Pain level is marked on a 100 mm line with the 0 mm corresponding to ""no pain"" and the 100 mm corresponding to 10/10 pain. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 100 mm line between the ""no pain"" anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm). |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) Over Time |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  Prior to procedure then post-procedure: 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  Patient self-reported outcome measure to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The WOMAC consists of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: Pain (5 items), Stiffness (2 items), and Physical Function (17 items). The following descriptors are used for all items: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. These correspond to an ordinal scale of 0-4. The scores are summed for items in each subscale, with possible ranges as follows: pain=0-20, stiffness=0-8, physical function=0-68. A total WOMAC score is created by summing the items for all three subscales. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. The score can range from 0 to 96; however, this score is typically reported as a percentage of 100 for normalization. Patient self-reported outcome measure to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated issues. KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL).

Current treatment limitations have generated interest in alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, some with the aim of healing damaged articular cartilage. There has been preliminary support in the literature for reduced pain and improved functional performance in patients who receive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as part of a treatment regimen. MSCs can be costly and are limited by complex regulatory issues. This interest in an alternative isolation method lead to the development of Lipogems. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems. In addition, given the limitations of prior research on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids, the investigators will also include this as an additional study group to compare to placebo. There have been case reports published showing favorable outcomes. This would be the first study reporting data on the efficacy of Lipogems for pain relief in knee OA in a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample of patients.

The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive an injection of Lipogems will experience a decrease in pain of the affected knee and an increase in joint functionality in comparison to placebo. The investigators also hypothesize that patients who receive an intra-articular corticosteroid will experience decreased pain or improved functionality in the affected joint compared to placebo.",Efficacy of Micro-fragmented Adipose Tissue Injection for Knee Osteoarthritis.,"Evaluating the Efficacy of Micro-fragmented Adipose Tissue and Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injections for Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis: a Randomized, Placebo Controlled Study.",,

One of the most common knee injuries is a meniscus tear, which can have several consequences. Immediately, the soldier may be separated from the military for over one year or assigned a permanent activity limiting duty profile. Over time, meniscal tears may also increase the risk of other knee injuries, such as osteoarthritis, which is one of the most common medical reasons for discharge from active duty service. The current standard of care includes conservative treatments, such as physical therapy and rest. Once conservative treatments fail, surgery is generally the next option. However, there is limited evidence that surgery is effective and some studies suggest it can accelerate the development of osteoarthritis. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a regenerative treatment for meniscal tears termed micro-fragmented adipose tissue in reducing pain and restoring activity levels. We will recruit active-duty military personnel and civilians with meniscal tears and provide them with either the adipose tissue treatment or a control treatment consisting of saline.

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out.

Each variable contained ranked subscales that could be summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 14, with 0 representing normal skin and a higher score representing a more marked or abnormal scar. The Chinese version of the VSS has been shown to have good intraclass correlations and Cronbach's α measures. All scars will be assessed independently by two observers on the same day when the participants are lying in a supine position with the scar exposed in bright light.

In the case of failure after corticosteroid treatment, different therapeutic options have been introduced as second or third-line strategies. In this scenario, infusion of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has emerged as an additional tool for treatment of GVHD.

Although an overall and disease free survival of 85% to 100%, can be obtained in allogeneic blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation using an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor, only about 25% of patients have such a donor.

PURPOSE: In an attempt to avoid GVHD, reduce earlier infection rate and decrease regimen-related toxicity while maintaining better engraftment, this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient's own adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) or AD-MSC transdifferentiated HSC (AD-HSC) transplant after an immunosuppressive regimen in treating patients who have severe aplastic anemia.

The patient will be in the study for one year for observation and active monitoring. After treatment and active monitoring are over, the patient's medical condition will be followed indefinitely. The principle measures of safety and efficacy will be :

Patient survival probability at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.

HOOS consists of 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living (ADL), and function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec), and hip-related quality of life (QOL). In total, 40 items: 10 items for pain, 5 items for other symptoms (3 for symptoms and 2 for stiff- ness), 17 items for function in ADL, 4 items for function in Sport/Rec, and 4 items for hip-related QOL. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is scored from 0 to 4. Scores are summarized for each subscale and trans- formed to a 0-100 scale (0 indicating extreme problems and 100 indicating no problems). Change in Harris Hip Score (HHS) score. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points). Change in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)  The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures. Change in modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) score. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points). Change in IKDC Questionnaire score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function  The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms. Change in WOMAC score. WOMAC score is used to assess patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee using 24 parameters in 5 categories.  1 Pain 2.Stiffness 3.Physical function 4.Social function 5. Emotional function  Scoring and Interpretation  Response : points none - 0 slight 1 moderate 2 severe 3 extreme 4  score = = summary (points for relevant items) average score = = (total score) / (number of items) Interpretation: minimum total score: 0 maximum total score: 96 minimum pain subscore: 0 maximum pain subscore: 20 minimum stiffness subscore: 0 maximum stiffness subscore: 8 minimum physical function subscore: 0 maximum physical function subscore: 6 Change in DASH score. DASH outcome measure is a 30-item. The items enquire about the degree of difficulty in performing different physical activities because of arm, shoulder and hand problems (21 items), the severity of each of the symptoms of pain, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness and stiffness (five items) and the impact of the problem on social functioning, work, sleep and self-image (four items).  The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability  A minimum score is 30; a maximum is 150. The range of the scores, therefore-from 30 to 150-equals 120. The raw score is then transformed to a zero-to-100 scale with zero reflecting no disability (good function) and 100 reflecting maximum disability. Change in CMS score. CMS is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient  The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function. Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain in the target hip following completion of treatment cycles. Visual analogue scales (VAS) are psychometric measuring instruments designed to document the characteristics of disease-related symptom severity in individual patients and use this to achieve a rapid (statistically measurable and reproducible) classification of symptom severity and disease control The VAS is a commonly used tool in health outcome studies, when using it to assess importance of certain action or intervention, how we can interpret the results, on 1 to 10 line (where 1; the least and the 10; the highest) |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  HIP DISABILITY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (HOOS) Harris Hip Score Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) modified Harris Hip Score for knee The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Questionnaire) WOMAC (for hip and knee) Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] The Constant-Murley score (CMS) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Time Frame: Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  Defined as any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, or diseases that emerge or worsen relative to baseline (i.e., if present upon study entry) during the study regardless of causal relationship.

HOOS consists of 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living (ADL), and function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec), and hip-related quality of life (QOL). In total, 40 items: 10 items for pain, 5 items for other symptoms (3 for symptoms and 2 for stiff- ness), 17 items for function in ADL, 4 items for function in Sport/Rec, and 4 items for hip-related QOL. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is scored from 0 to 4. Scores are summarized for each subscale and trans- formed to a 0-100 scale (0 indicating extreme problems and 100 indicating no problems). Change in Harris Hip Score (HHS) The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points). Change in KOOS score  It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)  The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures. Change in modified Harris Hip Score (HHS) The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points). Change in IKDC Questionnaire score  The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee.  Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function  The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms. Change in WOMAC score. WOMAC score is used to assess patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee using 24 parameters in 5 categories.  1 Pain 2.Stiffness 3.Physical function 4.Social function 5. Emotional function  Scoring and Interpretation  Response : points none - 0 slight 1 moderate 2 severe 3 extreme 4  score = = summary (points for relevant items) average score = = (total score) / (number of items) Interpretation: minimum total score: 0 maximum total score: 96 minimum pain subscore: 0 maximum pain subscore: 20 minimum stiffness subscore: 0 maximum stiffness subscore: 8 minimum physical function subscore: 0 maximum physical function subscore: 6 Change in DASH score  The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome measure is a 30-item. The items enquire about the degree of difficulty in performing different physical activities because of arm, shoulder and hand problems (21 items), the severity of each of the symptoms of pain, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness and stiffness (five items) and the impact of the problem on social functioning, work, sleep and self-image (four items).  The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability  A minimum score is 30; a maximum is 150. The range of the scores, therefore-from 30 to 150-equals 120. The raw score is then transformed to a zero-to-100 scale with zero reflecting no disability (good function) and 100 reflecting maximum disability. Change in CMS. The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient  The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain in the target hip following completion of treatment cycles. Visual analogue scales (VAS) are psychometric measuring instruments designed to document the characteristics of disease-related symptom severity in individual patients and use this to achieve a rapid (statistically measurable and reproducible) classification of symptom severity and disease control The VAS is a commonly used tool in health outcome studies, when using it to assess importance of certain action or intervention, how we can interpret the results, on 1 to 10 line (where 1; the least and the 10; the highest), |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  HIP DISABILITY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (HOOS) Harris Hip Score Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) modified Harris Hip Score for knee The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Questionnaire) WOMAC (for hip and knee) Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] The Constant-Murley score (CMS) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)] Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)] Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)] Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)] Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)] Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5) |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  Defined as any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, or diseases that emerge or worsen relative to baseline (i.e., if present upon study entry) during the study regardless of causal relationship.

Disease presentation is varied but typically is based on characteristic aminotransferase elevations, histological abnormalities, elevated levels of serum globulins, and the presence of one or more autoantibodies. Two types of juvenile AIH have been identified according to seropositivity for smooth muscle and /or antinuclear antibody (AIH type 1) or liver kidney microsomal antibody (AIH type 2). Standard therapy in clinic consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which displays the efficacy in 80% of patients. However, 7% of patients deteriorate despite compliance with the standard corticosteroid regiments (treatment failure),13% of patients improve but not to a degree that satisfies remission criteria (incomplete response), 13% of patients develop serious drug-induced complications, and 50%-86% of patients will relapse after drug withdrawal. These serious drawbacks counterbalance the benefits of conventional therapy, and they are compelling reasons to refine current treatment strategies and pursue alternative therapies.

Histologically, the disease is characterized by chronic portal inflammation with infiltration, destruction and loss of the epithelial cells in the small-sized and medium-sized bile ducts. Currently, Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13-15mg/kg/day is recommended as therapeutic drugs for PBC by AASLD and is approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with UDCA may delay disease progression and prolong survival free of liver transplantation. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both.

Scale consists of six grades from 0 to 5; 0 denotes no symptoms and 5 indicates severe disability. For clinical purpose, mild disability range is from 0 to 2; moderate disability ranges from 3 to 4 and 5 indicates severe disability. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a 15-item impairment scale used to measure stroke severity. The NIHSS includes the following domains: level of consciousness, eye movements, integrity of visual fields, facial movements, arm and leg muscle strength, sensation, coordination, language, speech and neglect. Each impairment is scored on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 2, 0 to 3, or 0 to 4. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 42 (the higher the score, the more severe the stroke). The Barthel index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). It uses ten variables describing ADL and mobility including: help needed with grooming, toilet use, feeding, transfers, walking, dressing, climbing stairs, bathing, presence of absence of fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence. Each performance item is rated on this scale with a given number of points from 0 to 10 or 0 to 15. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 100. A higher number is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence. Totally dependent ranges from 0 to 20, severe dependent ranges from 21 to 60, moderate dependent ranges from 61 to 90, mild dependent ranges from 91 to 99, and 100 indicates completely independent. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Frequency of dose limiting adverse events Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to measure the prognosis National institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to measure stroke recovery Barthel Index (BI) to evaluate the self-care ability Rate of muscle strength level of the hemiplegic limb |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  3 days 3 months 3 months 3 months 3 months |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:  The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is based on a 15-point scale for estimating and categorizing the consciousness. The test measures the motor response (1 to 6), verbal response (1 to 5) and eye opening response (1 to 4). The score is determined by the sum of the score in each of the 3 categories, with a maximum score of 15 and a minimum score of 3. A lower number indicating a more severe injury and a poorer prognosis. The Glasgow outcome score (GOS) applies to patients with brain damage allowing the objective assessment of their recovery. This allows a prediction of the long-term course of rehabilitation to return to work and everyday life. Scale consists of five grades from 1 to 5. 1 denotes death. 2 denotes persistent vegetative state.3 denotes severe disability. 4 denotes moderate disability and 5 denotes low disability. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Mortality rate Change in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score Change in Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score MRI (T1, T2, Flair, DWI) scanning |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  12 months 1 month 12 months 12 months | ",All,30 Years - 75 Years,Phase 2,100.0,OTHER,Interventional, , ,May 2020,November 2022,November 2023,"August 26, 2019",,"May 26, 2020",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT04074408," intracavitary injection of humscs in acute basal ganglia hematoma after stereotactic aspiration intracavitary injection of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in acute basal ganglia hematoma after stereotactic aspiration: a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial procedure: stereotactic surgery biological: humscs procedure: stereotactic surgery biological: humscs biological: placebo parallel assignment    cohort 1 cohort 2 cohort 1 cohort 2 cohort 2       stereotactic aspiration surgery single intracavitary infusion 1 day after stereotactic aspiration surgery single intracavitary infusion 1 day after stereotactic aspiration surgery   stereotactic surgery humscs placebo  procedure biological biological",A study to examine the safety and potential effectiveness of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs) in adults who have suffered spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage in basal ganglia.

Study hypothesis: We start with the hypothesis that both treatments are equally effective.

Trial Design: This is a prospective study. The participating patients will be divided into two groups, each group receiving either one of the treatment modalities. This study will not be randomised or blinded. Both procedures will be done at the Spire Alexandra Hospital by Professor A. A Shetty, who is one half of the team that devised both techniques.

Trial Participants: All participants will be from patients attending Professor Shetty's clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital.

Planned Sample Size: 50 patients in each arm.

Follow-up duration: The participating patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery by visits to the clinic and assessed clinically. The surgical outcomes will be measured by by IKDC, KOOS and Lysholm scores; cartilage growth will be measured by the MOCART score.

Planned Trial Period: Two to three years

Primary Objective: To establish superiority, if any, of either procedure over the other.

Primary Endpoint: At the end of the 2 year follow up for all participating patients.",A Study to Compare Two Techniques for Articular Cartilage Repair:ACIC Vs.
