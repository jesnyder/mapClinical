      "BriefSummary": [
            "A new strategy for treatment of late radiation damage is to develop methods aimed at stimulating the regenerative capabilities of irradiated tissues. Since the main pathogenetic mechanism of the development of late radiation damage is the death or damage of the replicative mechanism of stromal cells (SC), a justified approach can be considered as transplantation of intact SC. Currently, there is convincing evidence in the scientific literature that the injection of intact autologous SCs into the zone of fibrosis surrounding the chronic radiation ulcer leads to the healing of a wound defect.\n\nAn Initiative Clinical Trial. Introduction of autologous regenerative cells of adipose tissue for the treatment of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula. It is assumed that patients will be included in the project within 12 months; the monitoring of each patient will last for 6 months; the total duration of the clinical part of the study will be 18 months; The total duration of the clinical trial including the preparatory phase and the writing of the report is about 24 months. It is assumed that at least 16 patients aged 20 to 75 years who have verified diagnosis of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula will participate in this pilot project. The aims of the clinical trial are to preliminarily assess the safety, effectiveness and quality of life of patients after introducing autologous regenerative cells of adipose tissue for the treatment of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula."

SF-36 is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health.\n\nThe SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.\n\nThe eight sections are:\n\nvitality\nphysical functioning\nbodily pain\ngeneral health perceptions\nphysical role functioning\nemotional role functioning\nsocial role functioning\nmental health",
