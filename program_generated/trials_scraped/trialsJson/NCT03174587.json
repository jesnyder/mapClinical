            "Lupus is a representative autoimmune disease that affects the whole body.

So, it is expected to have treatment effects of lupus nephritis.\n\nThe clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, phase 1 clinical trials.\n\nIf that subject's written informed consent form to participate in this clinical trial will be conducted the required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol within 56 days investigational drug administration.\n\nThen, the register for each dose step. For the final 3 subjects in the inclusion / exclusion criteria and be administered a drug test.\n\nCheck the adverse events for more than four hours after administration of the investigational drug, and will determine whether the expression of adverse drug reaction(ADR) by the visit after 3 days, 7 days and 28 days.\n\nExcept for dose administration, all subject are tested in the same schedule.
