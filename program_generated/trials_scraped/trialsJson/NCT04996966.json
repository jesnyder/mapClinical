The research process is as follows: 1. Sixteen eligible patients with ischemic heart disease were recruited, fully informed, and signed a consent form, and randomly divided into placebo control group (n=8) or hUC-MSCs treatment group (n=8); 2. Knee replacement was performed under general anesthesia in both groups. In the cell therapy group, 1\u00d710^6/kg human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells were intravenously injected to the patient immediately after the surgery and at day 3 after the surgery. Before the operation, 6 hours, 3 days, 7days, 14 days, and 28 days after the MSCs injection, all patients receive a review of which main content includes symptom improvement, lung function improvement, and adverse events."
