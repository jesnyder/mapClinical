            "This phase IIb study is a prospective, single-blind, parallel, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chondrochymal\u00ae in subjects with knee OA. All the subjects will be enrolled in Taiwan. The target population is composed of subjects with unilateral or bilateral OA knee(s). For subjects with bilateral OA knees, only the knee with more severe symptoms will be selected as the target knee. If the severities of the OA symptoms are the same for both knees, the knee with more pain should be selected, where the WOMAC pain score will take the priority over the VAS index. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of the study groups, Chondrochymal\u00ae Group or Control Group, in 1:1 ratio. To keep the blindness, the subject's eyesight will be masked by a curtain while receiving the IA injection."

The eligible donor's bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest or femur. The collected BM-MSCs were then cultured, expanded and cryopreserved in a Good Tissue Practice (GTP)-complied laboratory. The qualified cells in cryopreservation meeting the release criteria will be thawed, mixed with lactated Ringer's solution, and transferred into a sterile syringe as the final product.",

It is a scale of 10 cm in length, representing the subject's pain intensity with higher scores indicating more severe pain. VAS score ranges from 0 to 10 cm, and will be transformed to a \"0 to 100\" mm scale.",

It has 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The SF-36 QoL questionnaire consists of 8 scaled scores in various health domains including 4 items in vitality, 10 items in physical functioning, 2 items in bodily pain, 5 items in general health perceptions, 4 items in physical role functioning, 3 items in emotional role functioning, 2 items in social role functioning, and 5 items in mental health. The score for each domain will be transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, on which zero corresponds to \"worst health status\" and 100 to \"best health status\".",

The WORMS, diffusion mapping (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), and T2 map values (it is a value from the worst region for screening visit), will be recorded in the CRF to evaluate the effect on knee cartilage response.\n\nWORMS are used to evaluate the articular cartilage lesions at three joints, including 14 anatomic compartments as follows (Peterfy et al., 2004)",
            "Change from baseline in knee joint space width (JSW) of the target knee. Knee X-ray for knee joint space width (JSW) assessment will be performed on anterior-posterior (AP) view, Rosenberg's view, and axial view of patella 45\u00b0 (lateral part and medial part). X-ray will be performed for both knees at Screening Visit, while only for the target knee at the other scheduled visits.",

The maximum oral doses for acetaminophen, Etoricoxib, and Celebrex are \u2264 2000 mg/day, \u2264 120 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively, while the topical use of these three rescue medications is allowed at any dose levels.",

Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature. Respiratory rate, pulse rate, and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) will be obtained after the subject has been at rest for at least 5 minutes in a sitting position. Vital signs will be performed before and one hour after the Chondrochymal\u00ae or HA administration.",
