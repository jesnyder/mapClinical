All patients have previously banked their own mesenchymal stem cells at Hope Biosciences. Eligible participants are either over 50 years of age, have preexisting conditions, or are at high exposure risk of contracting COVID-19. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide immune support against COVID-19, measured by the percentage of participants in each category of a 7-point ordinal scale and the presence or absence of adverse events and serious adverse events related to the study drug. In addition, participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by standard clinical laboratories and inflammatory markers. Participants will complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires."
