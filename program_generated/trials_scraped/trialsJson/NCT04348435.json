The primary endpoint of this study is to provide immune support against COVID-19, measured by the percentage of subjects that develop symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by standard clinical laboratories and inflammatory markers. Participants will complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires."
