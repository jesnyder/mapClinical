            "The purpose of this study is to determine if mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from the fat tissue can be safely administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with spinal cord injury. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) have been used in previous research studies at the Mayo Clinic. All subjects enrolled in this study will receive AD-MSC treatment, which is still experimental and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for large scale use. However, the FDA has allowed the use of this agent in this research study."

All subjects will receive the same dosage of stem cells via intrathecal injection. Enrolled subjects will first undergo a minor surgical procedure in which a sample of the patient's adipose tissue will be harvested from a small incision in the patient's abdomen or thigh. The subject's adipose tissue will then be used to derive and culture-expand AD-MSCs for 4-6 weeks. Autologous AD-MSCs will be transplanted through intrathecal injection at the level of L4-5 under fluoroscopic guidance at a single dose of 100 million cells. Patients will be evaluated at set intervals following the injection: day 2, day 3, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 24, weeks 48, week 72 and week 96."

            "An adverse event is defined any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, or diseases that emerge or worsen relative to baseline (i.e., if present upon study entry) during the study regardless of causal relationship to the study drug.",
            "The severity of adverse events will be graded into the following categories: mild, moderate, and severe.",
            "The relationship of adverse events to study drug will be graded into the following categories: probable, possible, unlikely, unrelated.",
            "SAE is defined as adverse events that result in death, life threatening adverse experiences, hospitalization, new or prolonged disability/incapacity.",
            "The ASIA Impairment Scale describes a person's functional impairment (both motor and sensory) as a result of their spinal cord injury. The scale has 5 levels, ranging from A (complete) to E (normal).",
            "Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) are electrical responses recorded either from muscles, or from axons of the descending motor tract, in response to electrical or magnetic stimulation of nervous system structures that govern movement. While there are many different methods for stimulation and recording, the most common approach involves transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor pathway, using subdermal needle electrodes positioned in the scalp above primary motor cortex.",
            "Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs) are electrical responses recorded from the nervous system following electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve. For example, stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist produces electrical activity that travels along the sensory pathway on its way to the brain. This activity can be recorded with electrodes positioned along that pathway.",
            "Patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the spine and the spinal cord with and without contrast.",
            "Blood will be drawn in order to monitor for markers of systemic inflammation. The normal range of red blood cells varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 10^12 cells per liter.",
            "Serological test - Automated white cell differential. A machine generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells, usually split into granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.",
            "Serological test: Platelets are not complete cells, but actually fragments of cytoplasm from a cell found in the bone marrow called a megakaryocyte. Platelets play a vital role in blood clotting. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is in the range of 150,000 - 400,000/ cmm (150 - 400 x 10^9/liter).",
            "Serological test: C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. C-reactive protein is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/dL.",
            "Serological test. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test, and is a non-specific measure of inflammation. The normal range is 0-22 mm/hr for men and 0-29 mm/hr for women.",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of the body in the urine. A BUN test is done to see how well the kidneys are working. Results of the blood urea nitrogen test are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, so blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. Results are reported in mg/dL.",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A sodium blood test allows the doctor to see how much sodium is in the subject's blood. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. A normal sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) of sodium.",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliEquivalents per liter (mEq/L).",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal blood reference range of chloride for adults in most labs is 96 to 106 milliequivalents (mEq) per liter.",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Inflamed or injured liver cells leak higher than normal amounts of certain chemicals, including liver enzymes, into the bloodstream, which can result in elevated liver enzymes on blood tests. The reference range for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is as follows: Males: 6-34 IU/L, Females: 8-40 IU/L.",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. For a subject without diabetes, a fasting blood sugar on awakening should be under 100 mg/dl.",
            "Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal range for carbon dioxide is 23 to 29 mEq/L (milliequivalent units per liter of blood)."
