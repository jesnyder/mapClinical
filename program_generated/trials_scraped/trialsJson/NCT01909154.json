In this study, the lesion is considered chronically established, when there are no signs of functional recovery after a minimum follow-up period of 6 months after the spinal cord injury. The upper age limit is justified by the low potential of in vitro expansion of bone marrow stromal cells over 60 years.\nComplete paraplegia, with loss of motor and sensory function below the lesion (grade A in the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment (ASIA) Scale .\nSpinal injury MRI morphologically visible, and without images that suggest spinal cord transection, with separation of the both ends of the spinal cord.\nTracking evolutionary possibility after treatment protocol and to comply physiotherapy maintained throughout the follow up period.\nWritten informed Consent according to good clinical practice (GCP) and local regulations, obtained before any study procedure.\nHematological parameters and creatinine, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) in normal range according to laboratory standards, are accepted, however, small non-significant deviations according to the investigator.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPregnancy and lactation\nSystemic disease represents an added risk to treatment\nPatients with questions about their possible cooperation in rehabilitation-physiotherapy treatments later, or negative report psychological assessment prior.\nNeuroimaging data showing spinal cord section with separation of the terminal portion of the spinal cord\nCurrent neoplastic disease diagnosed or treated in the previous five years\nPatients treated with hematopoietic growth factors or requiring stable anticoagulation\nAdded neurodegenerative disease\nHistory of substance abuse, psychiatric illness or allergy to protein products used in the process of cell expansion\nHIV positive serology and syphilis\nHepatitis B or Hepatitis C active According to the investigator's opinion if there are findings on physical examination, abnormal clinical test results or other medica relevant entries, social or psychosocial factors which might influence negatively the study."

            "Sensitivity recovery was measured using the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) scale to measure the Surface sensitivity (LTS), pain sensitivity (PPS), and the degree of motor function in key muscles (MS). The sum of MS, LTS, and PPS configure total ASIA score. A minimum possible score is 0 points. A maximum possible score is 224 points for a patient with normal sensation.\n\nASIA score was obtained before surgery, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. Mean and standard deviation for the 12 patients were obtained at all the time points and statistically analyzed.",

The minimum posible score is 0, and the m\u00e1ximum posible score is 48, being a score of 48 a normal functioning across all categories, and 0 a severe degree of functional h\u00e1ndicap (significant impact of daily life).\n\nPain is classified as no pain; mild pain, ordinary pain killer, effective;severe pain, narcotics required; extreme pain, uncontrolled.",
            "Changes in the neurophysiological parameters (SSEPs, somatosensory evoked potentials) measured as number of patients WITH SSEPs, each patient through underwent neurophysiological studies before treatment, as well as six and 12 months after surgery, paying attention mainly to the presence or abscence of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), the presence or absence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by magnetic stimulation over the scalp, and to electromyographic (EMG) recording of motor unit potentials in infralesional muscles. Previous to cell therapy in any of the patients SSEPs were recorded.",

The neurogenic bladder is one of the biggest problems associated with SCI (spinal cord injury), with important personal and social implications.",
            "Number of patients with a decrease in volume and hyperintensity of intramedullary lesions. In general, in the areas of SCI, variable degree of spinal cord atrophy and hiperintense images are observed. These images corresponds to cysts, gliosis and myelomalacia. After cell administration a reduction of supposed cyst and a decrease or disappearance of hyperintense lesions suggest a patient improvement."
