            "Recently there has been a growing interest in the role of subchondral bone in knee arthritis, both in its etiology and evolution and in its clinical significance. It has now been widely demonstrated that changes in the subchondral bone can develop both as a cause and as a consequence of joint degeneration and it is now accepted in the scientific community that the presence of these changes is of clinical importance, causing pain and an inflammatory state that can contribute to the evolution of arthrosis arthropathy. Recently the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow has been proposed for the treatment of gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently, treatments have been studied and proposed for the treatment of the bone-cartilage interface in knees affected by osteoarthrosis, using autologous bone marrow concentrate, with promising results."

            "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative and disabling disease of joint joints, in which metabolic impairment between the synthesis and degradation of cartilage and subchondral bone, involves progressive destruction of joint tissue accompanied by chronic pain and synovial inflammation. Currently, available therapies are mostly palliative and designed to mask symptoms. The study proposed here has been constructed on the basis of the scientific evidence reported in the literature regarding the etiology and the treatment of OA. As recently demonstrated, the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow was effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently, treatments aimed at treating the bone-cartilage interface in arthritic knees have been studied and proposed. In the 2016 Val et al. pilot study, stem cells from the tibial bone marrow injected into the percutaneous bone-cartilage interface were described as a new therapeutic approach to osteoarthritis of the knee. This procedure is able to repair cartilage by stimulating subchondral bone angiogenesis and alleviating ischemia associated with arthritic knee pain, generating extremely positive outcomes in patients with low-grade osteoarthritis and relieving long-term pain in patients with high-grade osteoarthritis. This treatment is also able to induce differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, leading to an increase in the size of the intra-articular matrix, demonstrating an effective and minimally invasive treatment for the resolution of OA. The study described here aims to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the synergistic effect of both injections, with the aim of improving the symptomatic picture of patients with OA of the knee. Combining percutaneous injections at the bone-cartilage interface with intra-articular injections will provide proven results for the use of stem cells such as cartilage repair, increased vascularity, and pain reduction, in both compartments of the knee affected by OA. The positive effects reported in the literature regarding intra-articular injections will be combined with those reported with respect to the use of percutaneous injections at the cartilage, in order to obtain a better outcome in the treatment of the disease than in previous studies."

            "The KOOS score consists of 5 categories; Pain, Other symptoms, Functionality in daily activities, Functionality in sports and recreational activities, and Quality of life. The previous week shall be taken into account as a reference at the time of compilation.

            "This score allows to estimate the level of motor activity of a subject with a score between 0 and 10 (0 represents 'incapacity' and 10 represents 'participation in competitive sports'). In the study the TEGNER Score will be compiled directly by the Investigator, through an interview to the patient.",
            "The WORMS score is composed of seven voices that describe in the complex, the aspect of the joint, evaluating specifically the state of the cartilage with sequences T2-weighted FSE and FS-3D SPGR (taking into consideration thickness and signal) presence of subchondral cysts with suppressed fat sequences T2-weighted FSE, presence of subchondral edema with suppressed fat sequences T2-weighted FSE, joint profile (considering any flattening or depression of the articular surface compared to normal), the presence of osteophytes and their size, the state of the meniscus, both medial and lateral, the state of the synovia by distension of the synovial cavity. The radiologist will fill the WORMS score forms.",
