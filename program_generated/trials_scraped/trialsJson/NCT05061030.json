            "This is a combined phase 1 and 2 study in 66 subjects, male or female, between 7-21 years of age that have recently (< 6 months) been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The first phase 1 part of the study includes six subjects openly receiving allogeneic Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells as the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) Protrans, three each in the age ranges 7-11 and 12-18.The second part is a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled phase 2 study in parallel design comparing allogeneic Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment (as Protrans) to placebo in children and adolescent subjects (7-21 years of age) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, The primary objectives of this study will be to investigate the safety, tolerance and efficacy after an allogieneic infusion of Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells."

The sixty subjects in the second part of the study are stratified by age (12-21 and 7-11 years, respectively) and randomized to one of two treatment arms (active or placebo), with a 6-month safety delay for the younger stratum.\nMentally stable and, in the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with the procedures of the study protocol.\nFasting plasma C-peptide concentration >0.12 nmol/L.\n\nSubjects of child-bearing potential must agree to using adequate contraception until one year after the administration of WJMSC/Placebo. Adequate contraception is as follows:\n\noral (except low-dose gestagen (lynestrenol and noretisteron), injectable or implanted hormonal contraceptives.\nintrauterine device\nintrauterine system (for example progestin-releasing coil)\nvasectomized male (with appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects with body weight >100 kg\nSubjects with unstable cardiovascular status incl. NYHA class III/IV or symptoms of angina pectoris.\nSubjects with uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265160/105 mmHg).\nSubjects with active on-going infections.\nSubjects with latent or previous as well as on-going therapy against tuberculosis, or exposed to tuberculosis or has traveled in areas with a high risk of tuberculosis or mycosis within the last 3 months.\nSubjects with serological evidence of infection with HIV, Treponema pallidum, hepatitis B antigen (subjects with serology consistent with previous vaccination and a history of vaccination are acceptable), or hepatitis C.\nSubjects with any systemic immune suppressive treatment\nSubjects with a known demyelinating disease or with symptoms or physical examination findings consistent with possible demyelinating disease.\nPregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\nSubjects with known, or previous, malignancy.\nTaking oral anti-diabetic therapies or any other concomitant medication which may interfere with glucose regulation other than insulin.\nSubjects with GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface.\nSubject with any condition or any circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make it unsafe to undergo treatment with MSC.\nKnown hypersensitivity against any excipients, i.e., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)."
