Intravenous and locally targeted stem cell treatment have already been reported in the context of treating various chronic pain conditions with early evidence of efficacy and a good safety profile. The treatment of CM is based on the model for treatment with botulinum where superficial facial and cranial injections are utilized. In addition, stem cells can be given intravenously as well."

            "Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling complex neurological disorder recognized as a complication of migraine in the the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Patients with CM experience headache on 15 days per month. CM is associated with significant disability and reduced health-related quality of life. Approximately 1.3% to 2.4% of the general population suffers from CM, and one in five CM sufferers cannot work because this condition impacts their ability to lead productive lives. CM is frequently complicated by overuse of acute pain medications. Some drugs have regulatory approval for migraine prophylaxis; none are approved specifically for CM prophylaxis although recently, botulinum injection has been FDA approved for CM treatment with marginal treatment effects with many patients failing to have complete remission. The present study is being undertaken as a phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell preparations (MSC) for treatment of CM."

            "Headache pain is scored on a range from 0 'no pain' to 10 'worst pain ever.' Patients reported the number of headaches total per month (each diary has a total possible number of 31 entries).Total score is calculated by adding the sum score of each headache (maximum possible = 310). Clinical improvement was noted for patients whose scores improved by at least 20%.",
            "The HIT-6 is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 6 questions, with qualitative answers ranging from \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" \"very often,\" and \"always\" to describe the frequency and impact of headaches on patient lives. Answers correspond with point values as following: never = 6 points, rarely = 8 points, sometimes = 10 points, very often = 11 points, & always = 13 points. A total score of 50 or more indicates severe disability related to headaches. Clinical improvement was noted for patients who reported at least a 20% decrease in their scores from baseline.",
