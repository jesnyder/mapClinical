            "Investigators plan to recruit 24 voluntary patients of decompensate liver cirrhosis with HBV, dividing them into 3 group\uff1a1) low-dose group: 100mL with 2.5\u00d710^7 cells\uff1b2) medium-dose group: 100mL with 5.0\u00d710^7 cells\uff1b3) high-dose group: 100mL with 1.0\u00d710^8 cells. Each group contains 8 patients. Investigators treat the participants with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells via venous transfusion. First investigators arrange a whole test for participants, such as vital sign examination, laboratory test, ECG, CT, MRI, ultrasound etc. Investigators screen these patients with a complete eligibility criteria. Then investigators proceed the therapy in the 1st, 8th and 15th day. There are 8 times of follow-up visit for these patients, 4 times of those are proceeded during the hospitalization, while other 4 times happens after the discharge. The follow-up visit includes vital sign examination, laboratory test, ECG, CT, MRI, ultrasound, Child-Pugh grade, MELD grade, SF-36 test. These follow-up visit last 24 weeks since the first treatment. After that, investigators also arrange a survival visit through phone or clinic each 6 months, lasting another 1.5 years. The main object of this research is investigating the survival rate, promotion of the liver function, improvement of health, safety of hUC-MSCs, tolerability of patients, for exploring a new way for the therapy of decompensated liver cirrhosis with HBV."
