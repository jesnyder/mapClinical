            "Interventions to alter the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee are elusive and joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far, the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators' pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion criteria."

Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit\nFemales becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will be recorded. Females in the multiple-dose cohorts (M50 and M100) who become pregnant during the treatment cycle will not receive their remaining injections.\nChronic (> 3 months), unilaterally symptomatic, primary femorotibial knee OA\nRadiographic medial and/or lateral femorotibial knee OA at least Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 accompanied by definite joint space narrowing as agreed upon by two study co-investigators\nPrevious 6 week or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments: activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or injection therapy (e.g. cortisone, hyaluronic acid/viscosupplement)\nAble to routinely walk without assistance (e.g. cane, walker)\nClinically stable target knee\nNo surgery planned in the target knee for at

Criteria\n\nPregnant or nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant during the study period\nCongenital or acquired malformation of the target knee resulting in significant deformity or leading to problems with the study treatment or analysis of the results\nSignificant malalignment on full length, standing radiographs\nArthroplasty hardware or implantable devices in the index knee

months prior to study enrollment\nLocking, catching, give-away or another major mechanical symptoms of the target knee\nSymptomatic patellofemoral arthritis or chondromalacia in the index knee\nHistory of intra-articular infection in the index knee\nHistory of superficial infection in the index knee within 6 months of study enrollment, or evidence of current superficial infection affecting the index knee\nHistory of falls requiring medical attention, or gait instability\nClinically significant abnormal hematology (complete blood count with differential), blood chemistry, or urinalysis screening laboratory results, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, creatinine, and CRP\nBody mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2\nTaking anticoagulant medications (e.g. warfarin, heparin) or clopidogrel (Plavix)\nTaking herbal therapies or supplements within 4 weeks of enrollment or unwilling to avoid use of herbal therapies or supplements until at least 30 days following completion of the study drug treatment cycle (includes, but not limited to chondroitin sulfate, diacerein, n-glucosamine, piascledine, and capsaicin)\nTaking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. COX-2 inhibitors) without a stable dosing regimen for at least 4 weeks before baseline evaluation, or anticipating not remaining on a stable dose until at least 30 days following completion of the study drug treatment cycle\nUse of electrotherapy or acupuncture for OA, unless there is a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks before baseline assessment\nTaking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other antimetabolites) within 3 months prior to study enrollment\nOn chronic, immunosuppressive transplant therapy or having a chronic, immunosuppressive state, including use of systemic steroids/corticosteroids\nCurrent tobacco product use, including nicotine patch or other nicotine products\nSystemic inflammatory, rheumatological or connective tissue disorder including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, system lupus erythematosus, and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome\nRheumatological or inflammatory disease of the knee or chondrocalcinosis/calcium pyrophosphate disease (CPPD), hemochromatosis, inflammatory arthritis, arthropathy of the knee associated with juxta-articular Paget's disease of the femur or tibia, ochronosis, hemophilic arthropathy, infectious arthritis, Charcot's knee joint, villonodular synovitis, and synovial chondromatosis\nOngoing infectious disease, including but not limited to tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis\nClinically significant cardiovascular (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension > 90 mmHg diastolic and/or 180 mmHg systolic), neurologic (e.g. stroke, TIA) renal, hepatic, orthopedic (e.g. surgery on other weight bearing joints that will interfere with study, osteoporosis, acute lower body fractures), or endocrine disease (e.g. diabetes).\nVascular or neurological disorder affecting the index either lower limb\nHistory of cancer/malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin not associated with the target knee\nHistory of blood dyscrasia, including but not limited to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and monoclonal gammopathy\nParticipation in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 3 months of study enrollment\nKnown allergy to local anesthetics of other components of the study drug\nAny contraindication to MRI scan according to MRI guidelines, or unwillingness to undergo MRI procedures\nHistory of or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, recreational use of illicit drug or prescription medications, or have use of medical marijuana within 30 days of study entry\nAny illness or condition which, in the investigators'
