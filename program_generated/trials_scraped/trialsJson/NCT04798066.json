If the study subject agrees to participate in the clinical trial, after reading the document, he/she must sign it. By giving his/her signature, study subject allows the principal investigator and/or designated staff to perform the following study procedures:\n\nCollection of medical history and demographic information.\nCollection of prior (up to a week before screening) and current medications.\nEvaluation of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.\nMeasurement of Weight in lb. and Height in inches.\nCollection of vital signs, including respiratory rate, pulse rate, SPO2, blood pressure and body temperature.\nCollection of laboratory samples, including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood Count and Coagulation Panel, C - reactive protein and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and urine pregnancy test if female of childbearing potential.\nCompletion of Patient Questionnaires, VAS of Symptom's and Fatigue Scale.\nPhysical Examination by the principal investigator.\nAdverse Events Monitoring. Within a 28-day period, all screening data should be collected and analyzed, and the principal investigator must decide whether the screened subject is eligible to participate in this Intermediate- Size Patient Population Expanded Access Protocol.\n\nVisit 2, 3, 4*, 5 and 6. (Infusions 1, 2, 3*, 4 and 5) Throughout these visits, the principal investigator and/or delegated staff will perform the following assessments:\n\nPre-Infusion Check List\nUpdate Medical History Form if necessary.\nUpdate Concomitant medications list if applicable. (no premedication necessary for the infusions)\nMeasurement of Weight in lb.\nCollection of vital signs, including respiratory rate, pulse rate SPO2, blood pressure and body temperature.\nCompletion VAS of Symptom's and Fatigue Scale.\nPhysical Examination by the principal investigator.\n\nInvestigational Product Administration:\n\nDrug Name: HB-adMSCs\nRoute: Intravenous\nDose: 200 million.\n24 hours telephone encounter after Investigational Product Administration to assess incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events.\n\nAdverse Events monitoring.\n\nAt Visit 4/Infusion 3: Collection of laboratory samples, including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood Count and Coagulation Panel, C - reactive protein, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urine pregnancy test female of childbearing potential and Patient Questionnaire.\n\nVisit 7 (Follow up 1/Phone call)\n\nUpdate Medical History Form if necessary.\nUpdate Concomitant medications list if applicable.\nAdverse Events monitoring.\n\nVisit 8.
