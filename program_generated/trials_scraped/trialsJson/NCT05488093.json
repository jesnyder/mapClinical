            "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease. It is characterized by a progressive destruction of all the components of the joint, especially the cartilage.

In the final stage, the only therapeutic option to relieve patients is to replace the joint with a total knee prosthesis.\n\nThanks to the contribution of an evaluation technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS device), our objective is to better evaluate and understand the movement deficit in knee OA subjects.\n\nThe hypothesis is that, thanks to the contribution of a technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS), the investigators can better evaluate the movement deficit of knee OA subjects. The goal is to propose specific, rapid telekinetic biomarkers, allowing a better evaluation of functional improvements following therapeutic interventions, such as a total knee replacement."

            "Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease. It is characterized by a progressive destruction of all the components of the joint, especially the cartilage.

In the final stage, the only therapeutic option to relieve patients is to replace the joint with a total knee prosthesis.\n\nPrevious research has shown that self-administered questionnaires to assess the benefits of management in knee osteoarthritis were limited and didn't accurately describe recovery from total knee replacement.\n\nFunctional performance tests can objectively capture a patient's mobility, but each test only approaches a small number of parameters involved in movement, which is not representative of the subject's experiences in daily life (walking, going up/down stairs, getting up from a chair).\n\nIn knee OA the assessment of pain and function is often based on validated parameters (visual analog scales and/or self-questionnaires) but variable over time (during the day, depending on physical activity or between 2 medical visits).\n\nGiven these challenges, there is great interest in using low-cost wearable sensors to develop mobile tools to obtain functional data on patients.\n\nThanks to the contribution of an evaluation technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS device), the objective is to better evaluate and understand the movement deficit of of knee OA subjects.\n\nThe investigators believe that the combination of clinical, biological, imaging and mobility parameters will allow us to identify prognostic factors for OA.\n\nThe hypothesis is that, thanks to the contribution of a technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS), the investigators can better evaluate the movement deficit of knee OA subjects. The goal is to propose specific, rapid telekinetic biomarkers, allowing a better evaluation of functional improvements following therapeutic interventions, such as a total knee replacement.\n\nAnother hypothesis is to better understand the alterations in mobility of the knee OA subject by studying several parameters: contractile function of the quadriceps; changes in body composition and muscle volume; and biological functions of muscle fibers and joint tissue."
