Following a successful lead-in phase, a total of one hundred forty-four (144) subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive Combo, MSCs, c-kit+ cells, or placebo. After randomization, baseline imaging, relevant harvest procedures, and study product injection, subjects will be followed up at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study product injection. All subjects will receive study product injection (cells or placebo) using the NOGA\u00ae XP Mapping and Navigation System. Subjects will have delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DEMRI) scans to assess scar size and LV function and structure at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post study product administration. All endpoints will be assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 180 \u00b130 days and 365 \u00b130 days respectively from the day of study product injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, the Investigators will utilize an \"intention-to-treat\" study population, however an as treated analysis will also be conducted."
