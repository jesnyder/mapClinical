            "Traditionally, RA has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and non-biologics-DMARDs. Only non-biologics-DMARDs and, at a lesser extent, glucocorticoids have shown to be able to prevent or interrupt the inflammatory and destructive disease processes.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic stromal cells that are able to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, and adipose. MSCs can be easily isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue and rapidly expanded in culture. MSCs have also been shown to have immuno-suppressive and healing capacities, improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties could be used for novel therapeutic applications in various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), genetic bone and cartilage disorders and bone metastasis. MSCs can potently modulate immune responses, showing antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory capacities.\n\nThis study is a multicenter phase Ib/IIa, escalating dose, single blind clinical trial to assess the safety of the intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) to refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerance, and to identify, if possible, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose for future clinical trials on efficacy of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs for patients suffering rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under treatment with at least one non-biologic-Disease modifying antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) who have previously failed to treatment with at least two biologics. The secondary objective is to obtain information on the clinical and functional effects of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs in patients with RA and to explore pharmacodynamics parameters.\n\n53 patients (i.e. patients having received at least one dose of study treatment) in three different cohorts are planned to be included in this clinical trial. Expansion will start after acute toxicity assessment of the first three patients of each cohort.\n\nDose and intervals for the trial consist of the following active groups: a) first cohort: 1 million cells/kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; b) second cohort: 2 million cells / kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; c) third cohort: 4 million cells / kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15."
