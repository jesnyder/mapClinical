            "This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best method of delivery of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in improving heart function in patients with heart failure caused by anthracyclines (a type of chemotherapy drug used in cancer treatment). MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from progression to advanced heart failure."
