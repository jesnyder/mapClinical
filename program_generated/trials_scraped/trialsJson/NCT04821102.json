            "JOINTSTEM is injectables for an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.\n\nIt primarily aims to regenerate cartilage. The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is expected to stimulate the regeneration of cartilage, and to innovatively improve joint function with cartilage regeneration.\n\nThe subjects of this therapy were patients with K&L grade 3 aged 20 or older.\n\nThis study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with two arms to evaluate JOINTSTEM as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening period, approximately 21 patients will be randomly assigned into one of the following two arms in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 placebo control). After each patient completes 12-month visit (Visit 6) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis."

First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given in Table 1. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores.",
