      "BriefSummary": [
            "The immune system of a patient can attack the liver or the kidney received from a donor (organ rejection). This can be prevented by treating these patients long-life with immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs lead to numerous side effects and fail to prevent the rejection occurring months later after the transplantation (chronic rejection). Recently, it has been shown that a particular type of cells present in the bone marrow, namely Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), when injected to a patient, suppress its immune system and increase success rates of blood cells transplantation. This outcome opens doors to investigate the potential of these cells to provide a valuable tool for improving solid organ transplantation without the need of high concentration of immunosuppressive drugs. The present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of MSC administration after liver or kidney transplantation."

The outcome of each of these 2 subgroups will be compared with that of similar control patients undergoing liver or kidney transplantation but who will not receive MSC.\n\nLiver and kidney transplanted patients will receive standard immunosuppressive therapy, TAC-MMF-stero\u00efds and TAC-MMF-stero\u00efds plus an IL-2-R antibody respectively. Patients enrolled in the experimental arms will be infused with a single dose of 1,5-3,0 10E6 MSC/kg, 3(+/-2) days after the transplantation.\n\nWeaning of immunosuppression will be attempted from month 6 in liver transplant patients who did not present a rejection episode and show normal graft function and graft biopsy.\n\nKidney transplant patients will continue standard immunosuppressive therapy indefinitely.\n\nMale or female (>18 years) individuals unrelated to the recipient or the graft donor will be MSC donors.
