            "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease involving primarily the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. The main clinical features are back pain and progressive stiffness of the spine. Oligoarthritis of the hips and shoulders, enthesopathy, and anterior uveitis are common, and involvement of the heart and lungs is rare. The current understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder is limited.It mainly about to hereditary susceptibility (eg HLA-B27),infection and autoimmunity.\n\nAlthough traditional drugs, such as Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs such as methotrexate, salicylazosulfapyridine OR thalidomide) and steroids have been used in the treatment of AS, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response to these drugs is not satisfied. Addition, the severe side effects of these drugs have also been observed. The management of AS patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed. Although the application of TNF alpha receptor inhibitor (such as Etanercept) has got the success in the early treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, the tolerance to this biological agent make the therapy to this disease rather difficult. Recently, owning to its immunoregulatory, immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties, the infusion of human MSCs isolated from human bone marrow have been a promising and effective treatment to AS patients. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC transplantation in the AS patients and compare the efficiency with the Etanercept to treat AS patients.\n\nThis study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MSC transplant therapy (experimental group) or Etanercept therapy (control group). Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. The experimental group will receive infusion per week in the first 4 weeks and every two weeks in the second 8 weeks, totally for 12 weeks. After 3 months, patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After 12 weeks (Phase I) and 48 weeks (Phase II) from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated."

The MRI sequence included a T1-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence and a fat-saturated short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence.\n\nMR images were first analyzed using the ASspiMRI-a scoring system , which is based on grading disease activity on a scale of 0 to 6. In addition to the ASspiMRI-a scoring system, the inflammation area and average intensityof each inflammatory site were calculated. The background value (BV) was obtained by taking 10 normal sites of the vertebral body of 1 layer and calculating the average. The inflammation extent of each inflammatory site was calculated by the formula:\n\nvalue of inflammation area (VIA) \u00d7 [value of average intensity (VAI) - BV]. The summation of the inflammation extent of all inflammatory sites in all scanning layers was defined as the total inflammation extent (TIE) of each patient."
