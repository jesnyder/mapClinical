Each ATCell\u2122 cell line will be created from cells grown from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of a participant's own adipose tissue collected by liposuction, and each treated participant will only receive their own cells.\n\nWithin the treated group, 3 dosing levels will be explored: 50 million cells, 150 million cells, or 300 million cells, and a Placebo group which will receive 5% dextrose lactated Ringer's solution free of cells. Participant follow-ups will take place 1 day following the tissue harvest procedure and, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following ATCell\u2122 treatment. Comprehensive participant's evaluations involving data collection will take place 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment.\n\nIt has been proposed that in general, mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) events need to be taken far more seriously, and that even mild TBI events can result in lasting negative consequences as evidenced by lower performances on neuropsychological assessments when compared with age-matched controls2. In fact, this condition may eventually lead to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which, together may be termed the AD-like dementias3, further underscoring the need for effective clinical intervention. Currently, no effective treatments are available for this condition aside from treatment of the symptoms, although some more comprehensive treatments have been proposed."

            "Completed by Participant as a part of physician visits at baseline, and 1, and 6 months following treatment . Scores of completed SF-36 will be numerically determined and compared to baseline. Changes against baseline will be represented numerically (positive or negative).The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.",

Scores How long it takes the participant to connect a sequence of 25 consecutive targets in sequential order on a sheet of paper or computer screen to complete the two tests will be numerically determined (seconds) and compared to baseline. The goal of the test is for the subject to finish both parts as quickly as possible, with the time taken to complete the test being used as the primary performance metric If a person makes an error in the test, there's no change in the score other than that it makes their completion time longer since the person has to go back to correct the error, thus extending their time, shorter completion times indicate improved scores.",
