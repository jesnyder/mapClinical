      "BriefSummary": [
            "There is evidence that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) can differentiate into oligodendrocytes and neurons, and improve the recovery of nerve function, which strongly suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of hUCB-MSCs as an intervention treatment for spinal cord injury. At present, there are only a few clinical centers in which hUCB-MSCs transplantation for treatment of chronic spinal cord injury has been performed and a certain degree of efficacy has been achieved. However, this has not been supported by systematic standardized randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the investigators design a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs to treat spinal cord injury. The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the locomotor function of patients with spinal cord injury. The secondary objectives were to investigate whether hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the muscle tension of patients with spinal cord injury and investigate the complications and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation."

Patients interested in participation in this study or their legal guardians contact the project manager via telephone. Patients will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria after providing signed informed consent. Eligible patients with chronic spinal cord injury will receive intravenous, lumbar, and local administration of hUC-MSCs/hUCB-MSCs (provided by Cell Bank of Stem Cell Clinical Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University). The primary outcome measure of this study is neurologic function scores, including ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) motor score, ASIA sensory score, ASIA impairment scale (ASIA classification), and acupuncture score. These scores will be used to evaluate the recovery of nerve function after spinal cord injury and determine the therapeutic efficacy and persistence. The secondary outcome measures of this study include Walking Index of Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI), Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Kunming Locomotion Scale (KLS), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and Visual Analogous Scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse reactions. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, patients will be followed up to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation in the treatment of spinal cord injury."
