            "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.\n\nThis study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.\n\nPatients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months post initial injection."
