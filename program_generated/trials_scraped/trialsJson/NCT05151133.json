            "The investigators is now carrying out a clinical study of Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UCMSCs) in the treatment of Allergic rhinitis (AR). UCMSCs is known to its multilineage differentiation potential, strong proliferation ability, low immunogenicity, convenient material acquisition, and fewer restrictions on ethical and moral issues. The investigators hope to find a novel, minimally invasive, effective and simple treatment for the large number of patients with persistent moderate to severe AR."

            "Allergic rhinitis (AR), is a noninfectious inflammatory disease of nasal mucosa mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody and involved in a variety of immune active cells and cytokines after the atopic body is exposed to allergens. The incidence of allergic rhinitis increases as people's living standards improves. It is estimated that about 1.4 billion people worldwide have been affected by the disease. Some patients with moderate to severe AR have no improvement in symptoms after drug treatment, which continues to affect daily life and work. Therefore, these patients urgently needs a new, minimally invasive, effective and simple treatment. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the mesoderm, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat and other cells. MSCs can also secrete a variety of bioactive molecules, which have the effects of regulating immunity and anti-inflammatory. Based on its immunomodulatory effect, MSCs is gradually becoming a new star in the treatment of allergic diseases. In pre-clinical studies on the treatment of AR, MSCs have shown good therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThis study is a prospective, open, single-center clinical study. Participants were recruited into three different dose groups. The cohort size of each dose group was 6 participants. The subjects of each group each will receive one course of treatment with a single injection. Subjects of group 1 will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 2 will receive 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg; with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 3 will receive 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs. One month after each injection, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will comprehensively evaluate the results of the phased clinical research, and after determining the safety and feasibility of the research, the enrollment of the next phase will start. The subjects will be followed up on the 3rd day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the treatment. The main outcome measures are the severity and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcome measures are RQLQ score, VAS score, serum inflammatory factor detection, nasal secretion inflammatory factor detection, nasal function test and nasal endoscopy, etc. In addition, the investigators will also monitor safety indicators such as blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, immunological indicators, tumor markers, etc. At the end of the study, according to the data obtained, the clinical safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of UCMSCs in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent AR will be evaluated, so as to provide drug dose basis for the next stage of clinical research."

A total of 28 measurements are individually scored from 0 to 6 points. A score of 0 indicates that the subject has not been affected by nose and eye symptoms in the past week, a score of 1 indicates that it is almost unaffected, a score of 2 indicates a minor influence, a score of 3 indicates a slight influence, a score of 4 indicates a moderate influence, and a score of 5 indicates a severe influence, a score of 6 indicates that it is extremely severely affected. In terms of daily activities, a score of 9 directly indicates that daily activity cannot be carried out due to nose and eye symptoms.",
