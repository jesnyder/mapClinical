            "The majority of Covid-19 cases either are asymptomatic or result in only mild disease. However, in a substantial percentage of patients, a respiratory illness requiring hospital care develops, and such infections can progress to critical illness with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support (Zhou 2020) , (Chen 2020) , (Cao 2020) , (Ruan 2020) . Among patients with Covid-19 who have been admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom, the case fatality rate has been approximately 26%, a percentage that has increased to more than 37% among patients who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation.(Docherty 2020) Although remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time until recovery in hospitalized patients, (Beigel 2020). Efforts to modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death have shown promising results.\n\nINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT The NK1R+ MSC cell therapy are allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells that will be delivered intravenously.\n\nDetails on cell culture and expansion of the cells are provided in the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls Section of the IND.\n\nCells are provided cryopreserved and are thawed, washed, and prepared for IV delivery.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and the optimal cell dose of the NK1R+ hMSC in patients recovering from ARDS.\n\n."
