            "This is a single site, randomized single blinded, two arm study researching the effects of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) versus Triamcinolone in patients with hip osteoarthritis. The aims and hypothesis are as follows:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Evaluate the change in pain and functional scores of a single bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in patients with hip osteoarthritis through validated patient reported outcomes scores at baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that triamcinolone and BMAC groups will have pain reduction after each respective intervention. The changes with triamcinolone will be noticeable on the short term. The BMAC changes will take longer to have an effect but will longer duration. The investigators hypothesize that at 6 months and 1 year participants receiving BMAC will have better scores reported on the WOMAC compared to the triamcinolone injection and better than prior to injection.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Evaluate the change of bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in participant's performance on the 6 minute walk test from baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be higher walking distances on the 6 minute walk test in the participants receiving a BMAC injection in comparison to triamcinolone starting at the 3 months follow-up time.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Quantify and correlate cell characterization with patient reported outcomes score.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be better patient reported outcomes in patients who have a higher concentration of mesenchymal stem cells injected.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 50 patients into each arm. Bone marrow will be aspirated then subsequently concentrated using the Emcyte PureBMC kit. The investigators will test the BMAC viability, rapid sterility, endotoxin, platelet concentration, volume, and total nucleated cell counts prior to injecting. The BMAC will be utilized as a hip injection into the affected hip of the patient.\n\nPatients receiving the Triamcinolone will undergo a sham bone needling to simulate the aspiration to keep patients blinded. Both groups will receive their injections under ultrasound guidance."

            "The goal of the study is to enroll 50 subjects in the bone marrow arm (BMAC group) and 50 in the triamcinolone arm (triamcinolone group). Once part fulfill the inclusion criteria, participants will be randomized to either intervention.\n\nParticipants will be enrolled in a staggering manner for the BMAC arm. The first 4 participants will be enrolled with at least 1 week interval in between these patients. During these weeks, the investigators will obtain results from the BMAC culture and evaluate safety response to the procedure. Participants enrolled in the triamcinolone arm will not be enrolled in a staggering manner, as the safety and efficacy are established as this is part of standard of care for hip osteoarthritis.\n\nParticipants will have the study protocol explained to them and will consent to the study, agreeing to have the bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and hip injection performed. Prior to any interventions, the participants will complete the baseline patient reported outcomes scores, and blood draw outlined in SOA section 1.3\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed during screening. Kellgren-Lawrence grade will be determined by blinded radiologists and co-investigators (Drs. Amer Hanano and Carl Winalski). An average score will be taken.\n\nIn order to blind the patient of the intervention, the triamcinolone group will undergo a \"sham\" bone needling of the bone cortex to simulate bone marrow harvesting (BMH). The posterior iliac spine will be anesthetized and needled simulating a BMH. Following the needling, the group will then receive a triamcinolone injection.\n\nThe process of aspirating the bone marrow used has been described by Dr. Friedlis and Dr. Centeno and will be completed under ultrasound guidance and in sterile fashion19. Multiple small draws of maximum 10 cc will be completed from different locations in the posterior superior iliac spine. The procedure as described is safe and been completed in more than 2000 individuals. Three to six passes are completed on each posterior superior iliac spine and a total volume of 60 cc of bone marrow is aspirated.\n\nThe BMAC group will have bone marrow aspirated using the Emcyte ASPIRE\u2122 needle and subsequently concentrated using the Emcyte PureBMC\u2122 system. 1 cc will be sent for further testing at Biosciences Research Associates and 1 cc will be utilized for endotoxin testing, total nucleated cell counts (TNC), gram stain, and viability. BMAC concentration including TNC will be analyzed on a hematology analyzer, Micros ES 60, immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow.\n\nThe parameters are set below:\n\nParameter Acceptance criteria Total Nucleated cell count (TNC) \u226540 x 106 cells/mL Platelet Concentration \u2265 600 x 106 cells/mL Final volume (from the device) \u2265 7 mL\n\nThe investigators will measure endotoxin concentrations utilizing the Charles River Nexgen PTS point of care instrument. The limit of endotoxin for general medical devices is 0.5 EU/device output. The investigators will abide by this parameter. All testing will be performed immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow and before injection into patient to ensure the device output safety.\n\nRapid sterility will be assessed using a gram stain, performed by a CLIA certified laboratory at Cleveland Clinic Florida. If gram stain is positive, the aspirate will not be injected. Patient will be considered a screen failure. All testing will be performed immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow and before injection into patient to ensure the device output safety.\n\nViability will be measured at bedside, as well as at Biosciences Research Associates. Cells will be stained with trypan blue and subsequently read on an autofocus, automated cell counter. Viability of 90% or more is expected. All testing will be performed immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow and before injection into patient to ensure the device output safety.\n\nRapid sterility testing will be completed at Cleveland Clinic Florida CAP accredited lab and 14 day sterility will be further analyzed by independent Wuxi AppTec.\n\nThe remaining 5 cc will be utilized as the intervention group injectate. The BMAC will be injected as is and will not undergo any further manipulation and/or dilution.\n\nThe 5 cc BMAC dose or triamcinolone will be injected into a single affected hip joint under ultrasound guidance.\n\nOnce the injection has been completed, patient will be monitored for 15 minutes and discharged home. Participants will be instructed to not use ice or anti-inflammatory medications for at least 6 weeks. For pain control following the procedure, the participant will be recommended to use acetaminophen or tramadol depending on the severity. Heat may be applied to the hip joint in case of muscle tightness. Ice should be avoided at the injection site. It may be applied at the site of bone marrow aspiration.\n\nParticipant will then follow-up in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-procedure to completed PROs and functional assessment with research staff. Participants will be asked to communicate to the Principal Investigator when anti-inflammatory medications are initiated, if necessary. Following the injections, both groups will resume home exercise program which participants had been completing prior to the injection in a pain free approach."
