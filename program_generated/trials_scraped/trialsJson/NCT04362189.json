Eligible participants are suspected to have COVID-19 and consent to participate. The primary endpoints of this study are to detect change from baseline in inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, C Reactive protein), improving oxygenation, and decreasing time to return to room air (RTRA). In addition, participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by standard clinical laboratories, change from baseline in exploratory markers (D-dimer, myoglobin, troponin, creatinine kinase MB, serum ferritin, CD4:CD8 ratio, CD3-CD56+), time to negative PCR results and clinical improvement according to 7-point ordinal scale, as well as incidence of adverse events."
