            "To date, the main pathological characteristics of AD patients are the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) into senile plaques, the abnormal aggregation of intracellular Tau protein to form neuron fiber tangles (NFT) and neuron death. There are still no effective treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse Alzheimer's disease.\n\nExosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. These vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling, and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.\n\nThe purpose of this single center, open label, phase I/\u2161 clinical trial, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficacy of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exos) in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease."
