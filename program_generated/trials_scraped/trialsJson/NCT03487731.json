(This includes but is not limited to a trial of oral medications, 6 weeks of physical therapy, intra-articular injection of the facet joints, and/or facet joint medial branch neurotomy.)\nDiagnosis of lumbar facet joint pain confirmed by analgesic injections.\nHave spinal level L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 bilaterally for bilateral pain and same side only for unilateral pain.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nIn order to participate in this study, a subject must not:\n\nPrevious surgical intervention for back pain\nPrevious mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injection(s) in to facet joints\nUse of anticoagulation or NSAIDs within 5 days of the injection\nMRI finding of severe high grade lumbar stenosis\nLeg pain exceeding back pain\nPain worse with flexion maneuvers\nFracture of lumbar vertebrae\nBe a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraceptive methods. Female subjects must undergo a blood or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to injection.\nInability to perform any of the assessments required for endpoint analysis.\nClinically abnormal screening laboratory values.\nSerious comorbid illness or any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the subject or preclude successful completion of the study.\nHypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nBe an organ transplant recipient.\nHave a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., subjects with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curatively-treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma, if recurrence occurs.\nHave a non-pulmonary condition that limits lifespan to < 1 year.\nHave a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months.\nBe serum positive for HIV, hepatitis BsAg or Viremic hepatitis C.\nBe currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial."
