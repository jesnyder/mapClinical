            "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established therapeutic modality for high risk hematological malignancies in adults and children. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality after HCT is graft versus host disease (GVHD), affecting up to 70% of patients even with current prophylaxis and directly accounting for approximately a third of regimen-related death. Currently, pharmacologic prophylaxis consists of a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate, a drug combination introduced around 40 years ago. Despite this regimen being recognized as the standard of care, it is only partially effective, increases the risk of infection and disease relapse and imparts drug-related, short- and long-term adverse effects. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potent immune modulatory activity which is markedly enhanced by exposure to interferon \u03b3. In murine models, interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) primed MSCs (\u03b3MSCs) potently suppress GVHD without untoward adverse effects suggesting this cell therapy may markedly reduce the regimen related toxicity of HCT; however \u03b3MSCs have never been infused into patients.\n\nThis protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that freshly expanded \u03b3MSCs can be reliably produced and safely infused into patients undergoing HCT as GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nThis is an investigator-initiated Phase I study using a rolling 6, dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual to the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined in adults. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for a future Phase II study to demonstrate efficacy and support a Phase III randomized trial.\n\nThe researchers plan to enroll a minimum of 4 and maximum of 45 subjects who are greater than 1 year old. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after the HCT. The study will be conducted at Emory University and will recruit participants from the Winship Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital in Atlanta at Egleston."

Relapse and death prior to neutrophil engraftment are considered competing risks for the endpoint of primary graft failure.",

            "Platelet engraftment is defined as the first day of a minimum of three consecutive measurements on different days such that the patient has achieved a platelet count > 20,000/\u03bcL and > 50,000/\u03bcL with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of the three measurements will be designated as the day of platelet engraftment.",

GvHD: Death from acute or chronic GvHD, in the absence of relapse or disease progression.\n\nInfection: Death from documented viral, bacterial or fungal infections in the absence of GvHD or relapse/disease progression.\n\nOrgan toxicity: Death from major organ toxicities not attributable to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/MDS, infection or GvHD.\n\nOther: Any other causes of death.",

For the purpose of this study, relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or MDS and including minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL consistent with pre-transplant features. The event for this endpoint is the time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease or to last follow-up. Death in remission is considered a competing risk.",
