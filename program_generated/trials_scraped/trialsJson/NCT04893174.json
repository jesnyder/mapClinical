            "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common type of arthritis diagnosed. KOA is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of articular cartilage. The prevalence of the Knee osteoarthritis will continue to increase as life expectancy and obesity rises. Osteoarthritis is typically a progressive disease that may eventually lead to disability. The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.\n\nThe rate of progression also varies for each individual. Common clinical symptoms include knee pain that is gradual in onset and worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain after prolonged sitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment for knee osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options when conservative treatment fails. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis currently exist. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of KOA."
