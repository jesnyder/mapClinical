            "This randomized clinical trial aims to determine if cells from a patient's own adipose tissue is safe and capable of helping regenerate the femoral head in patients with osteonecrosis. The standard of care is known as hip decompression which simply removes dead tissue from the femoral head and creates a new cavity to be filled in by healthy bone. This trial will use hip decompression in one hip and hip decompression supplemented with adipose derived regenerative cells in patients with osteonecrosis in both of their hips."

      "DetailedDescription": [
            "Preclinical and clinical data suggest that ADRC may serve as a safe and efficacious adjuvant agent for the treatment of ON. However, to the authors knowledge no RCT in the United States has formally evaluated safety of ADRC in the setting of ON. Therefore, the primary endeavor of this Phase I pilot study will be to evaluate safety of ADRC for pre-collapse ON of the femoral head.\n\nThe Celution 800/GP System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, USA) for preparation of ADRC from lipoaspirate is currently being evaluated in FDA approved clinical trials including an orthopedic indication (osteoarthritis). In addition, the device has a CE Mark registration in Europe and Class I approval in Japan. As such, it serves as a known platform that produces a clinical grade product for human use. Other devices on the market process lipoaspirate by either mechanical, washing, or centrifugation methods; however, the remaining components of original adipose tissue are significant and impair the regenerative process. Derivation of relatively pure ADRC has been achieved by few devices and the Cytori Celution 800/GP System is the only one to our knowledge with a sufficient safety and efficacy track record enabling multiple investigational device exemption (IDE) approvals. The reagent used (Celase\u00ae) is of a clinical and pharmacologic grade for use in humans. The production of Celase is free of mammalian products."
