      "BriefSummary": [
            "There are about 240 million chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected people in the world, and about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients every year. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. Reversing or delaying the process of cirrhosis and reducing the development of compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is one of the effective methods for liver disease treatment. MSCs are mainly derived from bone marrow, but bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have some shortcomings, such as cumbersome sampling, and the proliferation and differentiation ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells decrease obviously with the age of donors, which is not conducive to cell therapy. Umbilical cord has many advantages, such as wide source, convenient collection, small immune rejection, and small ethical controversy, which makes it a hot spot in stem cell research and has a wider prospect in cell therapy. This clinical study will explore the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B virus-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis."

            "There are about 1.7 billion people with different types of chronic liver diseases in the world, of which about 240 million are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and about 15%-40% of chronic hepatitis B can develop into liver cirrhosis and die of liver hardness every year There are hundreds of thousands of patients. There are about 90 million hepatitis B carriers in China, including about 20 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Every year, about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated liver cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. From the progression of liver fibrosis to the decompensation of liver cirrhosis, liver failure often occurs. Statistics show that slow increase The 28-day mortality rate of patients with acute liver failure of grade 1, 2 and 3 is as high as 22%, 32% and 77%. The 90-day mortality rate was 41%, 73%, 95%. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the most effective means to treat decompensated liver failure due to liver cirrhosis, However, the shortage of donor liver, immune rejection and high cost have become treatment obstacles. Application of artificial liver support system for blood flow Plasma replacement can remove toxic substances from blood, but it can't supplement albumin and coagulation factors, and it is important to whether reducing the mortality rate is still controversial. Therefore, it reverses or delays the process of liver cirrhosis and reduces the compensatory stage of liver cirrhosis It is an important link in the treatment of liver diseases that the patients develop into decompensated stage The curative effect of medical treatment on hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory period) is very limited; Liver transplantation is difficult to popularize in clinical application due to the lack of donors and high cost. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are derived from mesoderm in early development, is a high degree of self-renewal ability, Pluripotent stem cells with high proliferation ability and multidirectional differentiation potential widely exist in bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, and other tissues. They can be cultured and expanded in vitro, and can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, cartilage tissues, nerve cells, hepatocytes and so on under the control of specific conditions, which has great application value in cell therapy and tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory stage). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group, with 10 cases in each group, a total of 20 cases. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, namely, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with stem cells based on conventional medical treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of patients were observed in detail within 24 weeks after treatment, and the long-term effect of stem cell therapy was observed after 96 weeks of treatment."
