            "This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center, superiority study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JointStem, autologous adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC), in patients diagnosed as knee osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening period, approximately 140 subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the following two arms in a 1:1 ratio (1 JointStem : 1 Placebo). After each subject completes 48-Weeks visit (Visit 8) and the data management team confirms all individual data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis."
