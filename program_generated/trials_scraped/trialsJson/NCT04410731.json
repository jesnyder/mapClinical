The normal range of red blood cells varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 10^12 cells per liter.",

Platelets play a vital role in blood clotting. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is in the range of 150,000 - 400,000/ cmm (150 - 400 x 10^9/liter).",
            "Serological test: C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. C-reactive protein is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/dL.",
            "Serological test. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test, and is a non-specific measure of inflammation. The normal range is 0-22 mm/hr for men and 0-29 mm/hr for women.",

Urea is made when protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of the body in the urine. A BUN test is done to see how well the kidneys are working. Results of the blood urea nitrogen test are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).",

Almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, so blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. Results are reported in mg/dL.",

Inflamed or injured liver cells leak higher than normal amounts of certain chemicals, including liver enzymes, into the bloodstream, which can result in elevated liver enzymes on blood tests.
