At second and fourth week, the participants are subjected to microneedle and fractional CO\u2082 laser according to the respective protocol in split-face fashion, which the randomization will be determined by an independent operator. Succeeding the treatment, four-fold concentrated ADMSCs secretome will be administered topically to the both sides of face. The final skin condition will ultimately be recorded at the sixth week, along with their satisfaction and convenience degree, also the adverse events experienced during the trial. Appropriate statistical analyses will subsequently be performed at the significance level of 0.05."
