            "Approximately 10% of all female Crohn's patients have a rectovaginal fistula. Rectovaginal fistulas cause air, stool, and/or drainage per vagina and may be associated with pain, recurrent urinary tract infections and diminished quality of life. Conventional therapy includes immunosuppressive medications used to treat Crohn's disease and various surgical interventions. However, all have limited ability to heal these fistulas. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat people with rectovaginal fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease."

The study will randomize 20 participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with MSCs versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved patients will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the six month visit to receive an injection of MSCs, and will be followed for one year after treatment for a total duration of 18 months."
