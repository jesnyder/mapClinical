Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items.

The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).",
            "Change in IKDC Questionnaire score\n\nThe questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee.\n\nScores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function\n\nThe transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.",

            "Change in DASH score\n\nThe Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome measure is a 30-item. The items enquire about the degree of difficulty in performing different physical activities because of arm, shoulder and hand problems (21 items), the severity of each of the symptoms of pain, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness and stiffness (five items) and the impact of the problem on social functioning, work, sleep and self-image (four items).\n\nThe scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability\n\nA minimum score is 30; a maximum is 150. The range of the scores, therefore-from 30 to 150-equals 120. The raw score is then transformed to a zero-to-100 scale with zero reflecting no disability (good function) and 100 reflecting maximum disability.",

These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient\n\nThe test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function",

Visual analogue scales (VAS) are psychometric measuring instruments designed to document the characteristics of disease-related symptom severity in individual patients and use this to achieve a rapid (statistically measurable and reproducible) classification of symptom severity and disease control The VAS is a commonly used tool in health outcome studies, when using it to assess importance of certain action or intervention, how we can interpret the results, on 1 to 10 line (where 1; the least and the 10; the highest),"
