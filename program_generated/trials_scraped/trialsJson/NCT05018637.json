            "Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are serious health problems. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has gained considerable attention to treat osteoporosis and OVCFs because implanted healthy MSCs could be differentiated into osteoblasts and reduce the susceptibility of fractures by facilitating new bone formation.\n\nThis study compares teriparatide (PTH 1-34) injection to combined treatment with Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) and teriparatide (PTH 1-34) in patients with OVCFs.\n\nIt is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 study."
