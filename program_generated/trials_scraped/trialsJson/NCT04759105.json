            "Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of disability in the world, affecting all occupational sectors with different incidence rates. It is estimated that 60 percent of all workers suffer from LBP during their careers, 10 percent of which become chronic (The Lancet. September 2017). Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of cases. A key characteristic of IDD is loss of matrix integrity and biomechanical functional failure. Today, no therapy can restore intervertebral disc (IVD) function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. Current therapies are aimed at pain reduction. When these treatments fail, several types of surgery are performed but they are often related to side effects, disturbance of motion and other biomechanical consequences. New strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Encouraging results from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that cell-based regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for LBP. LBP patients treated with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BM-MSC) showed rapid and progressive improvement of functional indexes of 65 percent to 78 percent over 1 year after intradiscal administration without side effect. ACTIVE is an ambitious randomized clinical trial aimed at developing a treatment for IDD based on intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC to improve the quality of life of workers and the disability of patients with LBP. ACTIVE main aim is to generate efficacy and safety profiles of single injections of 15 million cells/mL of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 4 discs) versus sham procedure. The regenerative potential of BM-MSC treatment will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technologies on quarterly basis up to 12 months."

Contraception will be maintained during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure. Additional pregnancy testing will be performed at the end of relevant systemic exposure. The patients will be required to use contraception from initial treatment administration until 24 months after the last dose of study drug.\nIn each case of delayed menstrual period (over 1 month between menstruations), confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended. The complete list of contraceptive methods is described in the patient information sheet.\nPositive serology for following infection: Syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B, or C.\nContraindication to MRI assessed by the investigator.\nIntolerance or allergy to local anaesthesia.\nAny history of Cancer or immunodeficiency disease.\nPrevious transplantation."
