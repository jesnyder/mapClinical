Separate cohorts of each group (NV and V) will receive either a single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions separated by 48-hour interval).\n\nThe Phase 2a randomized and placebo-controlled trial in this study will investigate the potential efficacy of IV infusion of ULSC in a total of 40 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS that will all be EITHER NV or V; the determination of that eligibility criterion and the ULSC dosing regimen will be based on Phase 1 data of safety and tolerability. Phase 2a will evaluate EITHER single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions separated by 48-hour interval).
