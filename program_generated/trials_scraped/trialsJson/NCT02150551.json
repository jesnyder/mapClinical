            "In this trial, investigators will infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells intravenously, as a treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis that has not responded to conventional therapies. The goals of this study are to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. When isolated from a donor and infused into an animal or human, they have been demonstrated to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease."
