            "A phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) was performed with primary Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) attended in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation, BSMMU, between January 2018 and December 2021. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of BSMMU for this clinical trial (Reference No: BSMMU/2018/25, dated 01/01/2018). Impacts of a single intra-articular (IA) injection of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) containing mesenchymal stem cells on pain, physical function, stiffness, and cartilage thickness assessed and compared before and after intervention. Patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis (OA) knee included in the study. Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiological scores were used to define OA grade; however, high-frequency musculoskeletal ultrasonogram (MSUS) was used to measure cartilage thickness. There is no standard protocol to follow while assessing cartilage thickness; however, recent work of Podlipska and co-workers would be a worth consideration for using adipose tissue for cartilage regeneration. As medial tibio-femoral joint is the most commonly involved in KOA, here, we consider medial femoral cartilage thickness. The assessment used a commercially available ultrasound device (Samsung Accuvix, 2010, origin- South Korea) with a 15 megahertz linear transducer ML6-15. The patient was positioned supine with the knee in full flexion. A proximal-distal probe sweeping over the anterior-central knee area, medial femoral articular cartilage imaged in an axial plane. Degenerated cartilage signified either loss of surface sharpness or increased inner echogenicity; local or total thinning of articular cartilage. The definitions for articular cartilage degeneration are as follows: Grade 0 - a monotonous anechoic band with sharp hyperechoic anterior and posterior interfaces, Grade 1 - loss of the average sharpness of cartilage interfaces and or increased echogenicity of the cartilage, Grade 2a - grade 1 plus thinning of articular cartilage less than 50%, Grade 2b - more than 50% but less than 100% thinning of articular cartilage, Grade 3 -100% local loss of the cartilage tissue.\n\nA total of thirty KOA was randomly divided into two groups - case and control. Both groups received conventional care for KOA (acetaminophen 1 gram thrice daily for 14 days, quadriceps strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, mind-body, proprioception, mechanical diagnosis, and therapy (MDT) exercises, and activities of daily living (ADL) modifications4, 18-20. Fifteen received six milliliters (ml) single-dose of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) and 3 ml activated PRP). PRP was activated with 0.1 ml calcium gluconate per 0.9 ml of PRP (1:9 ratio). However, no orthobiological product was given in another fifteen participants."
