            "Actively developing stem cells (SCs) transplantation techniques cause natural interest to the problem of regeneration in the lungs. Numerous experimental studies proved the benefits of different types of SCs in experimental models of pulmonary emphysema (PE).\n\nG. Zhen et al. have shown that the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rats with papain-induced emphysema leads to their migration into the lungs, differentiation into type 2 alveolocytes, and inhibition of apoptosis and prevention PE.\n\nK. Schweitzer et al. have proved the activity of inflammation in the airways, alveolocytes and endothelial cells apoptosis decreased after adipose SCs intravenous administration to mice with emphysema caused by chronic exposure to tobacco smoke or VEGF receptors blockade. The study of E.P. Ingenito et al. found that endobronchial installed MSCs engraft into the alveolar wall and peribronchial interstitium and release integrins, extracellular matrix components (collagen IV, laminin and fibrillin), platelet-derived growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor \u03b22.\n\nOur study also found reliable deterrent effect of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs on the development of elastase-induced emphysema in rats at different terms of transplantation.\n\nAfter the success of pilot studies have started clinical trials. Currently, the website http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov reported three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in patients with COPD and emphysema. Two of them have already been completed and the results of the first pilot project published.\n\nAuthors on the example of 4 patients showed a complete absence of adverse effects, improved quality of life and stability of functional parameters at 12 months after starting treatment One of the problems of MSC transplantation in patients with respiratory failure is an accelerated apoptosis of transplanted cells under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Since it is proved that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxia increases their survival in hypoxic conditions, increases the expression of growth factors and antiinflammatory cytokines, we suppose that MSCs grown in hypoxic medium may have a significant positive effect on the disease."
