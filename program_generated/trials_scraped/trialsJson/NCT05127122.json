The duration of the study is 60 days, and the endpoints are as follows:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nThe incidence of serious adverse events.\nAll-Cause Mortality at 28 days.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nVentilator-free days at 28days.\nImprovement in partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio from pre-infusion baseline(Day 0)to Day 7.\n\nThe study population will consist of 81 inpatient adult patients between 18 and 85 years of age with moderate to severe ARDS as defined by modified Berlin's criteria. Patients will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology to one of the following 3 treatment arms:\n\nPLACEBO: Normal saline 100 mL\nEXPERIMENTAL: IP 10 mL mixed with Normal Saline 90 mL\nEXPERIMENTAL: IP 15 mL mixed with Normal Saline 85 mL"

The required duration of usage of double barrier method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the beginning of the screening period until 90 days following the last dose of the study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nVulnerable populations such as pregnant patients, children, individuals with severe physical or mental disabilities who cannot provide meaningful consent.\nActive malignancy requiring treatment within the last five years.\nMajor physical trauma in the last 2 days, including motor vehicle accidents, assaults, mechanical falls with sequelae of significant bleeding or craniofacial bruising, and surgeries, such that not one or more injury may be undiagnosed at time of screening.\nDiagnosis or suspected diagnosis of sepsis without basic microbiology cultures (urinalysis, urine culture, two sets of blood cultures, respiratory culture, at least a standard respiratory viral panel PCR) being collected prior to screening. (Note: Standard respiratory viral panel is defined by at least PCR testing for Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza 1-3, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, and RSV.)\nDuration of mechanical ventilation exceeds 5 days or 120 hours.\nSevere pre-existing organ dysfunction prior to admission, as evidenced by being currently listed on one or more organ transplant list, or intermittent Hemodialysis (HD) or Peritoneal Dialysis.\nPresence of severe hematologic disorder or coagulopathy, such as Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy, as evidenced by the activation of a Massive Transfusion Protocols (as defined by the rapid administration of packed Red Blood Cells, Fresh Frozen Plasma and Platelets in fixed ratios, including at least 6 packed Red Blood Cells, within a 24 hour period) within 72 hours or frequent thrombosis of catheters (as specified by replacing 2 catheters or more within a 72 hour period of new placement) within 72 hours.\nSevere anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome requiring more than 10 units of packed Red Blood Cells transfused within the last 12 months.\nPatient is currently connected to Extracorporal Membrane Oxygenation."
