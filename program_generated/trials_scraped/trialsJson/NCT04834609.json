An alternative to this treatment could be injection with freshly collected autologous adipose tissue. In this study 27 patients with cryptoglandular anal fistulas were treated with freshly collected autologous adipose tissue.A clinical assessment of the patient prior to inclusion was undertaken and a loose seton placed for at least 6 weeks prior to fat injection. An MRI of the pelvis was performed before inclusion. Fistulas with secondary tracts and/or cavities were excluded. The operation was performed in one procedure including liposuction and injection of adipose tissue. A sample of adipose tissue from all 27 patients was analyzed. AT-MSCs were isolated and characterized using cellular and molecular analyses. Clinical and MRI-scanning evaluation of fistula healing and evaluation of ano-rectal function was performed after 6 months. AT-MSCs phenotype was compared between responders and non-responders with respect to fistula healing. The evaluation of the AT-MSCs was performed in a blinded manner."
