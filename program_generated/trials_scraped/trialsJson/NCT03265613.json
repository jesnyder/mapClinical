            "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both. Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."
