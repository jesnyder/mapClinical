Stem cell suspension will be injected by peribulbar and if the injection was done, patients will be given a quinolone antibiotic. On day 1st and day 7th after therapy, patients will be observed the presence of infection, inflammation, and increasing of eye pressure. On day 7th, day 30th, and day 90th after therapy, patients will do a visual field test, visual acuity test, electroretinography, funduscopy, and Optical Coherence Tomography examination. The observation results will be written in the observation table and analyzed by a statistic. After the data was completed, then make a discussion, conclusion, and suggestion of the study."
