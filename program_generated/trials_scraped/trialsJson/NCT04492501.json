All patients of Cytokine release storm (CRS) received either Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg or Dexamethasone 6-12mg/day irrespective of disease severity.",
            "addition to standard care TPE will be performed once daily using COBE Spectra Apheresis machine version 7 (Manufacturer TERUMO BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA INC) having continuous flow centrifugation. Venous access will be achieved using an ultrasound guided double lumen catheter (Arrow - 12 FR) via femoral vein. Patient's total blood volume will be calculated as per Nadler's formula. Anticoagulant acid dextrose ratio will be 1:10 and flow rate 30-40 ml/minutes (Adjusted as per hemodynamic status). Patients' blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation will be monitored throughout procedure. Duration of procedure varied from 2-4 hours and 1-1.5 times total plasma volume will be removed during each procedure. Replacement fluid will be fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline in 2:1 respectively. All procedures will be performed in intensive care or high dependency unit by Apheresis Department of PEMH. TPE will be continued till recovery.",

      "BriefSummary": [
            "Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related pneumonia, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Investigators have seen recently from experience in Western countries with best health care systems that pandemics cannot be managed in hospitals. Investigators have seen ICUs crowded to capacity, healthcare workers being exposed and going to quarantine or dying after exposure to large doses of viral inoculums. Investigators recommend that institutions should register for Clinical trials and consider emergency use of TPE. In Pandemics, time is of essence to avoid mortality by intervening early with available evidence, preferably as part of clinical trial.Since the outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19), main treatment modalities have been antivirals, interferons, glucocorticoids, anti-coagulants and supportive treatment in addition to traditional Chinese medicine. There are also clinical trials exploring hydroxyquinoline / chloroquine sulphate, azithromycin, immunoglobulins, Vitamin-C, washed microbiota, nebulized interferon, teicoplanin as well as Mesenchymal stem cells. However, most of these trials were small and remain in the experimental phase with currently no effective / speci\ufb01c antiviral with robust scientific evidence as regards the mortality reduction in COVID-19.In an attempt to treat COVID-19, investigator will use different investigational treatment either alone or in combination to see mortality and morbidity benefit on the basis of limitted evidence available so far. These investigational modalities include Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), Convalescent Plasma (CP), Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in addition to standard supportive treatment."

For adults not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 5 standard doses will be used. However, patients with known hypersensitivity to Remdesivir, multi organ failure, ALT > 5 times ULN and GFR < 30ml/minute will not be given Remdesivir.

At Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre (AFBMTC), MSCs will be isolated from bone marrow harvested cells. About 50ml bone marrow will be collected from iliac crest using aseptic technique in syringes primed with anticoagulant. The collected sample will be diluted with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and MSCs will be separated using density gradient centrifugation. After resuspension the cells will be seeded at a fixed concentration of 100,000 cells/cm2 in specially designed flasks and incubated at 37Oc in 5% CO2. Medium will be changed after every third day till harvesting of MSCs from the flasks. Once confluent (approximately day 20) the cells will be harvested with sterile techniques using Trypsin- EDTA solution."
