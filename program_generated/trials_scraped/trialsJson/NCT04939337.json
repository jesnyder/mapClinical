The current study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem cells from healthy donors for the treatment of perianal fistulas in patients presenting CD.\n\nPrimary objective: To assess the safety (incidence of treatment emergent adverse-events) of TH-SC01"
