            "The trial includes a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 32- week treatment period, and a safety Follow-up period of 20 weeks after the last investigational product administration.\n\nThis clinical trial will be open to enroll 60 eligible participants diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Patients' recruitment will be conducted by the study team, if eligible participants are identified based on eligibility criteria, a screening visit will be scheduled. Informed consent form will be given to the study participants and signed before any study procedures. Informed consent form will include information about the clinical trial and some aspects should be considered during this process.\n\nAfter Informed consent has been obtained, each participant should complete the following visits.\n\nVisit 1 - Screening, during this visit, the principal investigator will make the decision to determine whether the screened participant is eligible and whether the next visit can be scheduled. Once, the principal investigator has evaluated the eligibility of the subject screened (up to 28 days), a randomization process will be conducted in order to assign the eligible subject either allogeneic HB-adMSCs or placebo. Randomization will only apply to eligible subjects. If a study participant does not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the screening process, he/she will be considered Screen Failure (SF) and randomization is not required.\nVisit 2 - Infusion 1, (Baseline): this visit will be used as a starting point for comparison of participant's data. During this visit, eligible study participants will receive his/her first investigational product administration or placebo with monitoring of vital signs for a total of 2 hours after drug exposure. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 3 - Infusion 2: approximately 4 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 4 - Infusion 3: approximately 8 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 5 - Infusion 4: approximately 12 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 6 - Infusion 5: approximately 16 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 7 - Infusion 6: approximately 20 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nPhone Call - Safety Follow Up: approximately 24 weeks after the initial investigational product administration, active study participants will complete a phone call follow up.\nPhone Call - Safety Follow Up: approximately 32 weeks after the initial investigational product administration, active study participants will complete a phone call follow up.\nVisit 8 - End of Study, during this final visit (approximately 52 weeks after Week 0) a complete group of study assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic HB-adMSCs or Placebo administrations."
