      "BriefSummary": [
            "Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a kind of mesenchymal tumor with malignant differentiation potential. It originated from mesenchymal stem cells of gastrointestinal tract.The most common is that gastric stromal tumors(GST) make up 60-70% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.The first choice for the treatment of non-metastatic gastric stromal tumors is to ensure the integrity of the tumor and obtain the negative surgical margin.At present, the common surgical methods of resection of gastric stromal tumors include laparotomy and laparoscopy, most of them are partial gastrectomy, wedge-shaped resection, proximal subtotal gastrectomy, distal subtotal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy, etc.There was no significant difference between open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.With the rapid development of endoscopic technology in recent years, endoscopes have been continuously explored in practice.Laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery(LECS) is different from the past technology. It is a new radical resection of GIST presented by Japanese scholars. LECS resects the tumor completely by laparoscopy with the help of the precise positioning and guidance of endoscopy .This method conforms to the idea of the modern minimally invasive surgery, and avoids many problems\uff0csuch as incomplete resection and disorders of digestion caused by excessive tissue resection. Investigators will observe the diffenrence of LECS and traditional laparoscopic surgeries.Firstly,the investigators will collect 80 cases of GST patients, randomly assigned for the laparoscopic group, the LECS surgical treatment. Secondly, to analyzing the basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time, blood loss, the number of transfer laparotomy or laparoscopy, the number of cut edge positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, the cases of anastomotic fistula bleeding, stenosis, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency, reflux esophagitis, bile reflux gastritis and other indicators.The purpose of this subject is to observe the effectivity and safety of LECS , invent serval LECS equipment patents and provide some references for LECS applying to the minimally invasive surgery of the digestive tract tumor and multidisciplinary treatment mode.It also provides reference for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, ectopic pancreas, carcinoid, early carcinomas, giant adenomas and polyps."
