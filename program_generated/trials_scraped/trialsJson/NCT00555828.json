            "Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transendocardial injection using the Cordis Biosense NogaStarTM Mapping Catheter with the Biosense MyostarTM Left Ventricular Injection Catheter of 25 M, 75 M, and 150 M allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) in subjects with AMI.\n\nSecondaryObjective\n\nThe secondary objectives are to explore functional efficacy for subsequent study design, as well as late-term dose related tolerance, by:\n\nEvaluating the effect of allogeneic MPCs on exploratory efficacy endpoints related to cardiac function on Days 90, 180, and 1 year\nEvaluating the change from baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and the New York Heart Association Classification at 30 days, 3 and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years\nEvaluating follow-up safety through Day 360\nProviding preliminary data to support dose selection for future studies"
