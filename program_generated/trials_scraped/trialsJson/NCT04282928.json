            "Viral pneumonia is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by respiratory viruses. It is mainly caused by the invasion of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and adenovirus into the lower respiratory tract. Every winter and spring is the epidemic season. Influenza virus and adenovirus have high infectivity and pathogenicity. The rapid progress of some patients may be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction And died of complications. The fatality rate of severe patients is 9.8% - 60%. Most of the dead cases were the elderly and the patients with basic diseases. In addition to the complications, the main cause of death is ARDS caused by virus infection, on the other hand, the basic immune function of the elderly is poor, so it is difficult to form an effective antiviral response in response to virus infection. The direct destruction of the alveolar epithelial barrier and the systemic inflammatory response induced by the infection, namely, the destruction of the alveolar capillary barrier by the inflammatory waterfall, are the important pathogenesis of ARDS. How to effectively regulate the inflammatory response, prevent the inflammatory exudation and edema of the lungs, improve oxygenation, and reduce organ damage; at the same time, how to effectively improve the basic immune function and enhance the anti-virus immune response of such patients, has become the key to the success of the treatment of patients with severe viral pneumonia.\n\nUmbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) can differentiate into the different germ layers and play an important role in immune regulation and damage repair regulation. Clinical trials have shown that MSC is safe and effective in the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, and it can improve the immune function of patients with viral infectious diseases. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against severe viral pneumonia.\n\nThis is a randomized, singlecenter, open lable, intervention controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 40) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The routine treatment group (n = 20) will receive the treatment according to \"Influenza diagnosis and treatment plan (2019 version)\", the HUC-MSCs adjuvant Group (n = 20) will receive intravenous infusion of definitive HUC-MSCs (1\u00d710^6 cells/Kg \u00d7 body weight(kg), which was selected by immunomodulatory assay through coculture with BV2 cell) on the basis of the routine treatment once at day 1 after joining. Follow-up duration is 90 days. The difference of 90 day mortality and average length of stay between the two groups will be observed and recorded. The changes of inflammatory index, viral load, oxygenation index and pulmonary imaging will be monitored at different time points after treatment in the two groups. The serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) will be observed during the period.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore the efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of severe viral pneumonia through improving the antiviral immune response of patients, reduce the lung inflammatory damage caused by the virus and the pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the injury, and finally achieve the goal of reducing the mortality and improving the prognosis of severe patients, and to evaluate the safety."

            "Before the infusion of UC MSCs and on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 30th, 60th and 90th day after the infusion, the peripheral blood of the patients will be collected to detect the number of leukocyte (10^9/L) or lymphocyte (10^9/L).",

            "Before the infusion of UC MSCs and on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 30th, 60th and 90th day after the infusion, the peripheral blood serum of the patients will be collected to detect the level of CRP, SAA, ESR, PCT and IL-6 (\u03bcg/L).",
            "Before the infusion of UC MSCs and on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 30th, 60th and 90th day after the infusion, the arterial blood of the patients will be analyzed and the oxygenation index (mmHg) will be calculated according to the oxygen concentration of the patients. The change trend of the oxygenation index will be observed.",
            "Before the infusion of UC MSCs and on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 30th, 60th and 90th days after the infusion, the throat swabs and peripheral blood were collected respectively. The RNA copies of the virus will be detected by RT-PCR. The change trend of the viral load in the throat swabs/peripheral blood of the patients in each group will be observed after the treatment with different regimens, and the difference of the viral load between different groups will be compared",
            "Two senior (associate chief physician and above) respiratory radiologists read the films independently. The chest CT images of the two groups will be evaluated before UC-MSCs infusion and on the 7th, 30th and 90th day after UC MSCs infusion. The changes of chest CT images at different time points before and after treatment will be observed and the differences between different treatment groups will be compared."
