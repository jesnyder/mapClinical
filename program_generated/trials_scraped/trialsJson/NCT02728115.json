            "This is a first-in-human, non-randomized, phase I study in which participants with HD will receive three intravenous injections of one of two doses of the investigational product, one every month for three months. Safety evaluation data will be composed by the register of adverse events (including type, frequency, intensity, seriousness, severity, and action taken related to the investigational product), could be include changes in vital signs, physical and medical evaluations, laboratory or serology tests and electrocardiogram (ECG), and by the incidence of benign and malign neoplasms. Preliminary evidence of efficacy will be evaluated by global clinical improvement (CIBIS) and evolution of disease improvement (motor, cognitive and behavioral degradation) through Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale - UHDRS and inflammatory markers: IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 (interleukin IL) e TNF-alpha (tumoral necrosis factor alpha). CNS improvement will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluctuation in suicide tendency grade will be evaluated by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).The immunological response of HD product over the administration period will be evaluated by CD4+ and CD8+ proliferation and inflammatory markers release.\n\nParticipants who show evidence of loss of clinical benefit achieved over the course of treatment verified through worsening greater or equal to that expected for the natural course of the disease on motor, cognitive, behavioral and functional capacity symptoms assessed by the UHDRS scale, will receive additional doses of the product as long as there is clinical benefit at the Investigator's discretion and/or until the product is marketed. The same dose used by the subject during the treatment period will be administered throughout the period of additional doses."
