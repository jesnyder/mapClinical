            "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nMen and Women 18-75 years of age with a diagnosis of unhealing perianal fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease and must be on maximal standard of care therapy (e.g., antibiotics, 5-ASA, and immunomodulator, anti-TNF, anti-integrin, and anti-interleukin therapies) for at least six months duration.\nPresence of perianal fistula with maximum of two internal fistula tracts and a maximum of three external openings based on clinical assessment and MRI. Fistula must have been draining for at least 6 weeks prior to the screening visit.\nMedically refractory perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (i.e., standard of care such as antibiotics, immunosuppressives)\nHave no contraindications to MR evaluations: e.g., pacemaker or magnetically active metal fragments, claustrophobia\nAbility to comply with protocol\nCompetent and able to provide written informed consent\nConcurrent Crohn's-related therapies with stable doses corticosteroids, 5- ASA drugs, immunomodulators, anti-TNF therapy, anti-integrin and anti-interleukin therapies are permitted.\nA female participant and of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at time of screening, and must not plan to become pregnant during the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nInability to give informed consent.\nClinically significant medical conditions within the six months before administration of MSCs: e.g. myocardial infarction, active angina, congestive heart failure or other conditions that would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of the patient.\nSpecific exclusions: Hepatitis B or C, HIV, Abnormal AST or ALT at screening\nHistory of cancer including melanoma (with the exception of localized skin cancers) in the past five years\nReceived treatment with an investigational drug or device within 60 days of randomization or have not completed 5 half-life washout (whichever is later) for drugs or biologics. If the half-life of the product is not known, then subjects cannot be randomized within 6 months of investigation drug treatment.\nParticipated in a cell therapy-based trial within 6 months before randomization\nParticipated in Crohn's/ulcerative colitis or any fistulizing Crohn's study within 6 months before randomization\nPregnant or breast feeding or trying to become pregnant.\nPresence of a rectovaginal or perineal body fistula\nChange in Crohn's immunosuppressive regimen prior to enrollment. Subjects should be on stable, maximal medical therapy for 4 months prior to enrollment.\nUncontrolled intestinal Crohn's disease which will require escalation for medical therapy or surgery within 3 months of enrollment\nSevere anal canal disease that is stenotic and requires dilation or severe proctitis making difficult to the surgery\nA female or male participant unwilling to agree to use acceptable contraception methods during participation in study. Acceptable contraception methods include: Implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, an intrauterine device, a bilateral tubal ligation, a vasectomy, a vasectomized partner for female participant, double-barrier methods, and physical barrier if male participant is not vasectomized\nAssociated perianal abscess(es).\nLaboratory exclusions: Serum creatinine levels >1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Total bilirubin >1.5 \u00d7 ULN. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5.0 \u00d7 ULN. Hemoglobin <10.0 g/dL for females or <11.0 g/dL for males. Platelets <75.0 \u00d7 109/L.\nAny contraindications to MRI or surgical or anesthetic procedure(s)\nAny major GI surgery or major perianal local surgery within 6 months of randomization"

            "To assess fistula healing induced by the delivery of a single injection of 100M allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs on refractory perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease using radiographic assessment (MRI) assessments.\n\nComplete healing defined as MRI with an absence of a fluid collection >2cm in 3 of 3 dimensions, lack of edema, inflammation, or sign of active inflammatory response. A remnant of scar of a fistula tract may remain.\n\nPartial healing defined as MRI with an absence of a fluid collection >2cm in 2 of 3 dimensions, lack of edema, inflammation, or sign of active inflammatory response. A remnant of scar of a fistula tract may remain.\n\nLack of response defined as healing which does not meet the threshold for partial healing.\n\nWorsening disease defined as MRI with fluid collection >2cm in 2 of 3 dimensions, edema, inflammation, or sign of active inflammatory response. An increased number of tracts may be seen, or increased branching from the primary tract.",
