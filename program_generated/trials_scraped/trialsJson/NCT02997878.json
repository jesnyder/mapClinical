All patients who have been recruited to and completed the 14-day reporting period in stage 1 will continue to be evaluated for outcomes as per Stage 2.\n\nThe primary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\n\u2022 Is safe and tolerated over the period of trial follow up (up to 56 days)\n\nFor PSC patients only \u2022 Reduces serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients with PSC.

This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate marker of hepatic inflammatory activity and outcomes in AIH.\n\nThe secondary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C elicits a change over the duration of the study after treatment in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\nLiver biochemistry and function, immunoglobulin G concentrations (in AIH patients) and composite risk scores\nNon-invasive clinical markers of fibrosis\nPatient quality of life (QoL)\nSeverity of co-existent IBD in patients with PSC.\n\nFurther exploratory research objectives of the trial determine whether MSC infusion modulates the immune response by measuring whether treatment elicits a change in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\nMarkers of immune activation including immunoglobulin values and C-reactive protein concentration\nMarkers of biliary injury including total bile acid levels\nCirculating inflammatory cells profile this includes phenotypic expression of T regulatory cells (Tregs) a common mechanistic primary endpoint\nEndothelial cell activation markers such as VAP-1 and ICAM1\nSerum cytokine, chemokine, microRNA and RNA expression profiles"
