            "This study is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one, two, and three intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in young children with ASD. Children ages two to 11 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of CTCs. The first cohort of three patients will receive a single dose. If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three patients will receive two doses, given two months apart. The third cohort will consist of six patients, each of whom will receive three hCT-MSC infusions with a two-month interval between doses. All participants will have an initial clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD and confirm protocol eligibility. The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions and incidence of infections will be assessed. ASD-specific outcome measures, described below, will be assessed at baseline and six months from baseline and results will be described."
