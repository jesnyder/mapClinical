            "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, predicted to be the third leading cause of death in adults by 2020. Patients with COPD are characterized with airflow limitation and chronic inflammation, which is caused by cigarette smoking, noxious particles or gases. These inhaled irritants will induce inflammation, emphysema and fibrosis though chronic exposure. The current pharmacological treatment of COPD is symptomatic and is mainly based on bronchodilators, such as selective \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (short-and long-acting), anticholinergics, theophylline, or a combination of these drugs. In patients with continuing exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) may be added in the form of a triple fixed dose combination inhaler that includes ICSs, long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABA) and inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Although current clinical treatment strategies can improve and stabilize COPD states and quality of life, none of them are able to modify the progressive decline in lung function which is the hallmark of this disease. Therefore, development of new therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COPD in adult patients is of urgent need. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of COPD."
