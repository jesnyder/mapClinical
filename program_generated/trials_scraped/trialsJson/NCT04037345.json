Subjects who voluntarily signed consent form and met inclusion/exclusion criteria, were evaluated eligible and participated in this trial. Investigator selected knee to be evaluated (right or left) and administered investigational product to selected knee on Day 1.\n\nA total of 3 or 6 subjects will be enrolled in low-dose or mid-dose group each, and 6 subjects will be enrolled in high-dose group. The study used a dose escalation scheme (from low-dose to high-dose) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)."

The patient marks on the line at the point that represents their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end to the point of the mark. The score ranges from \"0\" or no pain to \"100\" very severe pain.",
            "Change of score in IKDC compared to baseline. IKDC subjective knee evaluation consists of three categories: symptoms, sports activities, and functions. For each category, there are 7 questions for symptoms, 2 questions for sports activities, and 2 questions for functions, a total of 11 questions for evaluation. The scores for each category are summed up and divided into 87, which is the maximum score possible, and then is evaluated by converting it into a scale of 100 points. Higher score indicates better function and less symptoms for the knee.",
