            "Inclusion Criteria\n\nParticipants aged 30-80 years old with a diagnosis of MSA based on clinical criteria and standardized autonomic testing. This approach allows for identification of patients with MSA with very high specificity and is yet sensitive enough to allow for enrollment of patients at a disease stage at which an intervention on the natural disease course has a meaningful impact on patient outcome. Patients therefore have to fulfill Gilman Criteria (2000) for probable MSA of the parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) or cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) and have findings on autonomic function testing suggestive of MSA (CASS \u22655 or a TST% \u226525%).\nParticipants who are less than 4 years from the time of documented MSA diagnosis.\nParticipants with an anticipated survival of at least 3 years in the opinion of the investigator.\nParticipants who are willing and able to give informed consent.\n\"Normal\" cognition as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We will require a value >24.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nAny of the following conditions will exclude the participant from entering the study:\n\nWomen of childbearing potential who do not practice an acceptable method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are: surgical sterilization, intrauterine devices, partner's vasectomy, a double-protection method (condom or diaphragm with spermicide), hormonal contraceptive drug (i.e., oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long-acting injectable contraceptive) with a required second mode of contraception.\nParticipants with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might preclude safe completion of the study or might affect the results of the study. These include conditions causing significant central nervous system (CNS) or autonomic dysfunction, including congestive heart failure, recent (<6 months) myocardial infarct, cardiopulmonary disease, severe, uncontrolled hypertension, thrombocytopenia (<50 x 10(9)/L), severe anemia (<8g/dl), immunocompromised state, liver or kidney disease (creatinine >2.3mg/dl), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c >10g%), alcoholism, amyloidosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, sympathectomy, unstable peripheral neuropathies, concurrent infections, orthopedic problems that compromise mobility and activity of daily living, cerebrovascular accidents, neurotoxin or neuroactive drug exposure, parkinsonism due to drugs (including neuroleptics, alpha-methyldopa, reserpine, metoclopramide).\nParticipants with malignant neoplasms.\nParticipants who have taken any investigational products within 60 days prior to baseline.\nMedications that could affect autonomic function. If patients are taking those medications, those will be suspended prior to autonomic testing. Therapy with midodrine, anticholinergic, alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists or other medications that affect autonomic function will be withdrawn 48 hours prior to autonomic evaluations. Fludrocortisone doses up to 0.2 mg per day will be permitted.\nDiseases with features of Parkinsons Disease; e.g., diffuse Lewy body disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, essential tremor, hereditary olivopontocerebellar atrophy, or postencephalitic parkinsonism.\nDementia (DSM-IV criteria - American Psychiatric Association 1994). The score on the Mini-Mental State Examination must be >24.\nHistory of electroconvulsive therapy.\nHistory of brain surgery for Parkinsons disease.\nPatients with contraindication for MRI scanning, including those with MRI-incompatible pacemakers\nPatients with active systemic infection or local infection, which is close to the spinal injection site"
