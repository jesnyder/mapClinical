            "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a complex condition affecting men worldwide. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common causes of ED. The prevalence of ED in DM varies around 35-85%. Recently, stem cell therapy has started to become the focus of experimental and clinical studies for the treatment of ED. Stem cells have been shown to be able to regenerate functionally damaged tissue, depending on the stimuli or signals received. Stem cells studies in experimental animals have been carried out using biomarker parameters, including VEGF, Bcl-2, E-selectin, cGMP, eNOS and have been shown to be successful in increasing cell survival and angiogenesis, stimulating antiapoptotic, proneurogenic, proinflammatory, and antifibrotic effects and improvements to these biomarker parameters. This study aims to determine the efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells as a therapy for ED due to type 2 diabetes in human."

            "Prior to conducting clinical trials, researchers asked for written informed consent. If the subject agrees, the study will direct the subject and control to collect basic data in the form of vital signs, blood pressure, filling out the IIEF-5 questionnaire, complete blood count (CBC), lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and total testosterone, biomarker examination (E-Selectin), VEGF, Bcl-2, miRNA 16, miRNA 126), and penile Doppler ultrasound. The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction was made on the basis of an IIEF-5 score <22.\n\nPenile Doppler ultrasound was performed by a senior radiologist with interpretation of the ultrasound images performed and reported in a blinded fashion (the reader/interpreter does not know the patient's complaints). Penile Doppler ultrasound examination was performed under flaccid conditions and post-sexual stimulation conditions. Prior to the examination, the patient was given sildenafil 100 mg orally, then the flaccid phase was examined. Patients were asked to perform sexual stimulation of themselves and measurements were taken afterwards.\n\nParallel with the patient recruitment, stem cells processing was carried out based on the production method using xeno-free material.\n\nAt the baseline, patient receive intracavernous injection procedure, as a following steps:\n\nThe base of the penis is clamped with ethiloop before the injection is performed.\nIntracavernous injection was performed in each body of 7.5 x 10^6 cells/1cc.\nClamps are removed after 30 minutes post-injection to increase stem cell residency and grafting time.\n\nAfter the procedure, we monitor the symptoms for 1 hour to assess the presence or absence of complications before the subject can go home.\n\nWe also administer PDE-5 inhibitor to all research subjects, namely tadalafil at a dose of 1 x 2.5 mg for 3 months.\n\nFollow-up was carried out on all subjects both from the experimental group and the control group by evaluating parameters consisting of IIEF-5, DPL, Lipid profile, HbA1c, GDS, total testosterone, Doppler ultrasound, e-selectin, Bcl-2, VEGF, miRNA 16, miRNA 126 at first and third month after baseline.\n\nAfter all data have been collected, we will perform data analysis and make research report."
