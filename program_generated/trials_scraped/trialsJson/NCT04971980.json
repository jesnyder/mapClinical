            "BC-U001 is an allogeneic fresh human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell product, which showed therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis(RA) based on its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue repair activities. The primary objective of this open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of BC-U001 for RA patients using a 3+3 design."

Three ascending dose cohorts (3 participants/cohort) will be treated successively to identify the maxium tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended dose for phase II study. Dose escalation will be terminated if the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed in 2 participants during the 28-day follow-up within cohort.\n\nDLT was defined as any \u2265grade 3 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 hemtological toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, which was related to the investigational product determined by investigator."
