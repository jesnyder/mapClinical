Researchers also want to learn if these cells can help control ARDS when given with drugs that are routinely used to treat ARDS.\n\nIn this study, participants will receive 1 infusion of MSCs.\n\nThis is an investigational study. MSC infusions for the treatment of ARDS is investigational.\n\nUp to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

            "The MSCs:\n\nMSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs used in this study were collected from healthy donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory at MD Anderson. The product you will receive is from a healthy donor that is not related to you.\n\nMSC Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive MSCs by vein over about 1-2 hours 1 time on Day 1.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Days 1 and 3:\n\nBlood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart, kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing.\nBlood (about \u00bd teaspoon) will be drawn to check the oxygen level in your blood.\n\nOn Days 14 and 30:\n\n\u00b0Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart, kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing.\n\nOn Days 30 and 60:\n\n\u00b0You will be checked for possible reactions to your treatment, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against your body). This will be checked by physical exam, by the doctor reviewing your side effects, and blood from standard of care blood draws.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYour participation on this study will end after the Day 60 study visit. You will be taken off study early if you are not able to receive the MSC infusion(s), if intolerable side effects occur, if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if you are unable to follow study directions."
