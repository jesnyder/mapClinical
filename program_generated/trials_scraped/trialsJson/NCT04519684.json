            "Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and select patients with Crohn's disease due to overall low patient morbidity and good quality of life. However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with permanent end ileostomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat people who have a peri-pouch fistula related to a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch."

The study will randomize 20 participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with MSCs, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at the month 6 time point."
