            "Screening Visit Week 0 The subject will go through a screening process that will last up to 14 days. During this time the Clinical Investigator will review labs and diagnostic test results to confirm study eligibility. Abnormal test results (i.e., ongoing infection), may require follow-up before proceeding with the treatment. This screening period will start with the \"Screening Visit\", which will include the following procedures:\n\nInformed Consent will be obtained.\nDemographics\nReview of inclusion and exclusion criteria\nReview of medical history and concomitant medications\nPhysical exam\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nHeight and weight\n\nBlood samples will be collected for safety assessments:\n\nHematology\nChemistry\nCoagulation Panel\nA verification of patient consent will be verbally performed.\nIntervention 1 Day 1 (Week 1) and Intervention 2 Day 1 (Week 12) Once the eligibility is confirmed, +7 days after the screening visit, the subject will return to\n\nHBSCRF to receive the IV treatment. Procedures will be assessed as follows:\n\nReview of medical history, adverse events, and concomitant medications.\nPhysical exam\nPatient pain assessment VAS of Pain\nPatient pain assessment WOMAC Knee Score\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nWeight measurement\nA verification of patient consent will be verbally performed\n\nThe HB-adMSCs will be administered and the patient closely observed:\n\na. One intravenous infusion of HB-adMSCs (2x108 cells) to last 1 hour:\n\nVolume: 250 ml\nRate: 4-5 mls/min (250ml/h)\n\nThe subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 1hr after infusion as follows:\n\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 0 of the infusion\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 15 after IV infusion.\nMeasure Vital Signs at minute 30 after IV infusion.\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 60 after IV infusion.\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 120 after IV infusion.\nVital signs will be recorded more frequently if clinically indicated).\nThe Subject will be given comprehensive discharge criteria/instructions.\n\nTelephone encounter for adverse events. The subject will be contacted by telephone the following day after the infusion visit to determine if any adverse events have occurred.\n\n* Post infusion discharge criteria Immediately following the completion of each infusion/injection, the subject should be assessed to ensure that the post-infusion discharge criteria have been met.\n\nParameter Values Systolic blood pressure + 20% of baseline.

Review of medical history, adverse events, and concomitant medications. b. Vital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2) c. Knee MRI without contrast at IA injection 1. If a Knee MRI without contrast has been performed in the last 14 days, it can be used as a baseline and compared with the following Knee MRI without contrast.\n\nd. The HB-adMSCs will be administered and the patient closely observed:\n\na. One ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection in the right knee with 1x108 cells/2ml.\n\nb. One ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection in the left knee with 1x108 cells/2ml.\n\ne. The subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes after the injections as follows:\n\na. Measure Vital signs at minute 0 of infusion. b. Measure Vital signs at minute 15 after IV infusion. c. Measure Vital Signs at minute 30 after IV infusion. d. (Vital signs will be recorded more frequently if clinically indicated). f. The Subject will be given comprehensive discharge criteria/instructions. g.

The patient will also undergo a thorough on-site follow up visit at the infusion site (HBSCRF) that will include:\n\nReview and update medical history\nUpdate concomitant medications list\nWeight measurement\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood samples will be collected for safety assessments*\n\na.
