The novelty of the current UMSC01 treatment is the single IV infusion of UMSC01 to the worldwide emergency outbreaks of COVID-19. We hypothesize that sufficient UMSC01 retention in lung may modulate the systemic inflammatory responses."

With considerations of the pandemic status and clinical practice, only one of the two active treatment groups will be selected to complete the Phase IIa study, which will recruit 60 patients."

Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\nFemale sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the woman should be confirmed by the hormone level assessment.\nMale sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects in the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.\nCombination of any two of the following listed methods: (d.1 + d.2 or d.1 + d.3, or d.2 + d.3):\n\nd.1 Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate < 1%), such as hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n\nd.2 Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). d.3 Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPregnancy, lactation, and those who are not pregnant but did not, or unwilling to, take effective contraceptives measures 4 weeks before and after the treatment.\nPatients with malignant tumors or other serious systemic diseases.\nPatients with hemoglobin < 10 g, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2265 5 \u00d7 ULN, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2265 5 \u00d7 ULN, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2265 5 \u00d7 ULN, total bilirubin (TBILI) \u2265 2 \u00d7 ULN, serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl, platelet counts < 100,000/\u03bcL, WBC < 3,000 cells/\u03bcL, or neutrophil counts < 1,000/\u03bcL at screening.\nPresence of barotrauma or hemodynamic instability defined as hypotension with diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 70 mmHg despite fluid expansion, and vasoactive support or pneumothorax at screening.\nUncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure > 170 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg which, in the investigator's judgment, would not make participation appropriate.\nRecent history of (within 2 years) ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular attack, such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or stroke.\nRecent history (within 2 years) of hypercoagulable disorder, antiphospholipid syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or deep venous thrombosis.\nCondition other than COVID-19 that is projected to limit lifespan to \u2264 1 year.\nHistory of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months.\nUnwilling to commit to follow-up visits.\nPatients who are participating in other clinical trials with an investigational product.\nCo-infection of HIV, tuberculosis, influenza virus, adenovirus, and other respiratory infection virus.\nPatients with other conditions that are not suitable to participate in this clinical study as determined by the investigator."
