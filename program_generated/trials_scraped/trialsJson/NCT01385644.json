An interim safety analysis will be carried out by the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) when these first 4 patients have all undergone their 3 month study visit. Should no serious adverse events be documented due, or likely due, to the MSC infusion, a subsequent 4 patients will receive an IV infusion of 2 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg. Therefore a total of up to eight (8) subjects who meet all eligibility criteria and who provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the study."
