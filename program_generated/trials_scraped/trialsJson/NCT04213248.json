            "Among patients with cGVHD, 60% - 90% are affected by dry eye symptoms, presenting as progressive development of dryness, foreign body sensation, photophobia, pain and even blindness, which seriously affect their life quality. At present, the standard first-line treatment of cGVHD is still hormone or combined with immunosuppressant of cyclosporine. The dry eyes related to cGVHD are treated with artificial tears, lacrimal punctum embolization, local immunosuppressant or even blepharoplasty to reduce dry eye symptoms. Although a variety of new immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies have been used in clinic, the overall efficacy is still unsatisfactory with apparent side effects, and the period of treatment is long with high-costs. Therefore, it is an urgent task for clinicians to explore new methods of cGVHD related dry eye therapy and improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients.\n\nExosomes are a kind of membrane vesicles secreted by parental cells, which can mediate the transfer of RNA, protein, DNA and other functional molecules between cells and regulate the function of target cells. The therapeutic potential of UMSC exosomes has been widely studied in diseases of liver, kidney, skin and so on. Previously, we found that UMSC exosomes can significantly alleviate the symptoms of dry eye in the dry eye animal model. At present, we plan to clarify its efficacy in clinical research.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to assess the alleviation of dry eye symptoms in patients with cGVHD after UMSC-exo treatment by measuring Ocular Surface Index Score (OSDI), and the second objective include the measurement of tear secretion amount, tear break time, the areas stained by fluorescent, ocular redness, tear meniscus and best corrected visual acuity.\n\nApproximately 27 study subjects will be recruited. The treatment group will receive artificial tears for 2 weeks to normalize the baseline, followed by intervention of UMSC-exo 10ug/drop, four times a day for 14 days. The follow-up visit will be 12-week, progression of dry eye will be measured."

Nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctival hyperemia were graded separately in each eye by the investigator under slit-lamp magnification by assigning a score of 0 to 4 for each quadrant based on comparison to the Allergan Dry Eye Redness Scale with photographic reference where: 0=Normal, vessels of bulbar conjunctiva are easily observed; 1=Trace redness; 2=Mild redness; 3=Moderate redness; 4=Severe redness, and each score is associated with a reference photo.",

Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean."
