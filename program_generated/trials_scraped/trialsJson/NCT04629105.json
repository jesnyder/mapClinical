A patient may be included if the PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 200 with < 8 cm H2O PEEP if there is a contraindication to increased PEEP (evidence of barotrauma).\nBilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on frontal chest radiograph.\nNo clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension for bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\nConfirmed diagnosis of infection with coronavirus or influenza virus.\nWilling to perform all assessments required for the study.\nMust agree to the collection of all blood samples per protocol.\nMust agree to have samples stored and used for secondary research.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatient receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).\nHistory of malignancy within previous 2.5 years, except for curatively-treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ, or cervical carcinoma.\n\nPrior positive test for any of the following without demonstration of resolution.\n\ni. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg). ii. Viremic hepatitis C virus (HCV). iii. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 or -2 (HIV1 or 2 HIV2). iv. Human T-cell leukemia virus-I or -II (HTLV-I or HTLV-II). v. Syphilis.\n\nFemale who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraception.\nKnown hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nBe an organ transplant recipient, other than for corneal, bone, skin, ligament, or tendon transplant.\nActively listing (or expected listing) for transplant of any organ, other than for corneal, bone, skin, ligament, or tendon transplant.\nContinuous use of any medication at immunosuppressive dosing for greater than 14 consecutive days over the past 3 months.\nCurrently participating in an investigational therapeutic or device trial, or have participated in an investigational therapeutic or device trial within the previous 30 days, or participate in any other clinical trial for the duration of the time that the subject actively participates in this trial.

Exceptions for other experimental interventions related to treating the patient's acute illness may be made with prior approval of Longeveron.\nAny serious comorbid illness or any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the patient or preclude successful completion of the study, or that may compromise the validity of the study."
