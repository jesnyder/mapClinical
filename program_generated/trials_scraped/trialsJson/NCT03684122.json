            "This study is predicted to confirm the safety of the use of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) in one of the most common neurological diseases. It will also aid in the better understanding of the role of stem cell therapy in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson disease. The safety outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body. While the efficacy results if encouraging, would mean an improvement in the disability associated with PD and reduction in the life-time care and treatment provided to this category of patients in Jordan and the Arab region."
