            "This Expanded Access includes an up to 28 days screening period, a 44-week Treatment Period, and a 52-week Safety Follow-up Period. All periods are associated with evaluations and procedures that must be performed at specific time points.\n\n-Screening\n\nAt the Screening Visit (Visit 1), the study's participant information will be collected by delegated personnel to evaluate trial eligibility. The following information is required to determine eligibility:\n\nParent Permission before any trial-related activities.\nCollection of demographic information, such as age, race, ethnicity, date of birth, gender, and relevant medical and surgical history.\nCollection of Medical History and concomitant medications, including relevant information about study participants' past and present health.\nInclusion and Exclusion criteria evaluation.\nMeasurement of vital signs includes respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight and height measurement.\nBlood chemistry, Coagulation panel, Inflammatory Markers, & Hematology.\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator.\n\nWithin 28 days of the Visit 1 - Screening, the principal investigator must decide the participant's eligibility. Once the principal investigator has confirmed the subject's eligibility, the subject will be scheduled to receive Infusion 1.\n\nInfusion 1 - Baseline\n\nThe following evaluations will be performed during this visit:\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\n\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator. As this 2-year-old is unable to walk or hold his head up without physical support, assessment for neurologic sequelae will include the following observations and discharge instructions for observations to continue at home by the primary caregivers:\n\nUnusual /new weakness or numbness on one side of the body\nNew or different slurred speech or new language difficulty\nNew vision problems\nSudden lethargy or drowsiness\nSeizure\nCHOP INTEND, PDMS-2 & PEDI-CAT by delegated personnel.\nInvestigational product administration by delegated study personnel. HB-adMSCs should only be administered intravenously, with vital sign monitoring of two hours.\nAssess the incidence of any adverse event.\n\nTwenty-four hours after administration of the investigational product, study participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by telephone call to assess the incidence of adverse events.\n\nInfusion 2 through Infusion 13.\n\nThe following assessments are necessary during these visits:\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\n\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator. As this 2-year-old is unable to walk or hold his head up without physical support, assessment for neurologic sequelae will include the following observations and discharge instructions for observations to continue at home by the primary caregivers:\n\nUnusual /new weakness or numbness on one side of the body\nNew or different slurred speech or new language difficulty\nNew vision problems\nSudden lethargy or drowsiness\nSeizure\nCHOP INTEND, PDMS-2 & PEDI-CAT by delegated personnel (at Inf. 1, 7, and EOS).\nCoagulation panel & Hematology. - (at Infusions 2,4,7,10, and EOS).\nInflammatory Markers & Blood chemistry at Infusions 2, 7 and EOS.\nInvestigational product administration by delegated study personnel. HB-adMSCs should only be administered intravenously, with vital sign monitoring of two hours.\nAssess the incidence of any adverse event.\n\nTwenty-four hours after administration of the investigational product, study participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by telephone call to assess the incidence of adverse events. The child's skin and eyes will be checked for symptoms of yellowing at each visit, and caregivers will be asked whether they have seen any vomiting, nausea, or the subject looking to be more tired than usual. Discharge instructions will include monitoring for these symptoms. Liver enzymes will be assessed at Screening, Infusion 2, 4, 7, 10, and End of Study per-protocol; however, these laboratory samples can be collected more often if the principal investigator indicates.\n\nSafety Follow Up\n\nThe following evaluations will need to be completed during this visit:\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\n\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator.\n\n-End of Study Visit\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\nCollect laboratory samples, including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), Complete Blood Count (CBC), Inflammatory Markers, and Coagulation panel.\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator.\nCHOP INTEND, PDMS-2 & PEDI-CAT by delegated personnel."
