            "The study is designed to examine the safety of administering EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% TBSA. The study will consist of a single dose level which will evaluate the safety of administering allogeneic Extracellular Vesicles-with a total of 10 patients. The chosen dosage will correlate to a dose of MSCs administered under another protocol (IND 14810). The dose level delivered will be EVs derived from approximately 1 X 104 MSCs for each cm2 treated area not to exceed 20% TBSA in total (cumulative, if more than one area is treated). The limitation in wound sizes to be treated will not change throughout the study. Up to 2 additional administrations of EVs will be given over a period of no more than 8 weeks. The first treatment will be administered within 48 hours of the burn injury. The subsequent treatments will be administered no less than 7 days and no more than 6 weeks apart."

      "BriefSummary": [
            "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in a variety of clinical applications to repair and regenerate damaged tissue. Previous research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of delivering bone marrow cells including MSCs to chronic wounds with significant improvement in healing and scarring. Application of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to severe burn wounds represents an opportunity for improved outcomes where alternate therapies are limited and often ineffective.\n\nIn this protocol, 2nd degree burn wounds will receive direct application of EVs derived from bone marrow MSCs. We have observed success with this type of approach in the past using bone marrow stem cells including MSCs. We have evidence that EVs derived from MSCs are responsible for many of the healing effects produced by MSCs and may be a safer, more reliable alternative to allogeneic cell therapy. This protocol is designed to develop a safe and ideal method of administering bone marrow cell Extracellular Vesicles to wounds."
