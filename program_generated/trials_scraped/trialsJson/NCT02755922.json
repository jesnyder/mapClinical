Intensity and density were evaluated in normal bone and fractured bone, at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery using panoramic radiography and computed tomography. (CT)\n\nA total of 20 patients, 10 in each group were included. SG with a mean age of 31.2 \u00b1 6.3 years and CG 29.7 \u00b1 7.2 years, all patients were male. Bone quality at week 4 SG 108.82 \u00b1 3.4 vs CG 93.92 \u00b1 2.6 (p = 0.000) by panoramic radiography, SG 123 \u00b1 4.53 vs CG 99.72 \u00b1 5.72 (p = 0.000) by CT.
