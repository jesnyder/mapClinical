            "Clinical assessment of wound morphology (and its changes during the treatment) in each treated patient, as well, as between patients in both study arms, expressed as:\n\nthe amount (1) and features (2) of wound exudate,\nthe presence of redness (3) and/or edema (4) in the wound surrounding skin,\nthe presence of granular tissue and fibrin (5) or epithelium (6) in the wound bed.\n\nThe listed parameters will be assessed using simplified questionnaire adopted from Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (positions 7-13 from B-JWAT).\n\nEach of 6 abovementioned features will be assessed semiquantitatively using 1-5 points scale, (with \"1\" for a best state, and \"5\" for a worst state). The sum of points allocated to each parameter will be recorded as the wound score and used for further analysis.\n\nThe healthy skin/healed wound should receive 6 points, whereas active wound, with exudate and inflammation will receive 30 points (the lower = the better / the higher = the worse).",

The minimum value is 0 and means \"no pain\" and the maximum value is 10 and means \"the worst possible pain\".
