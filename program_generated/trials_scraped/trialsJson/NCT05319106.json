            "Chronic wounds refer to the pathological changes such as cell senescence, imbalance of synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix, and decreased activity of growth factors caused by different reasons when the wound is prolonged and does not heal after conventional treatment for more than 1 month without healing tendency. Chronic wound can be caused by a variety of diseases, including arterial disease, diabetes, vasculitis, venous disease and skin malignant tumor, chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a disease leading to chronic wound, Venous ulcer (VLU) of lower limbs is the advanced manifestation of CVI, and the incidence of this disease ranges from 0.4% to 1.3% in China. 60% of VLU patients' ulcer wounds heal in 3-6 months, 33% in 12 months, and 7% May be permanently unhealed. The probability of recurrence is as high as 70% in patients 3-5 months after wound healing, which not only seriously affects the health and quality of life of patients, but also causes a very heavy social medical burden. At present, the conventional treatment for VLU mainly includes drug therapy, stress therapy, wound treatment and surgical treatment, but the therapeutic effect is not ideal."
