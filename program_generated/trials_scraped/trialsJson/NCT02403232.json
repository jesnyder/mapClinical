      "BriefSummary": [
            "Crohn's disease is an immunologically mediated inflammatory bowel disease with a reported incidence of 4.0-7.0, 7.1, and 1.34 per 100,000 persons in Europe, the U.S., and Korea, respectively. Uncontrolled chronic inflammation finally causes various complications in intestine such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, and anal fissures.\n\nThe incidence of perianal fistula was reported in 13%- 39% of patients with Crohn's disease. Medical treatment for Crohn's fistulae initially focused on surgical intervention accompanied by symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressants. The most serious problem after surgical intervention is the relatively high incidence of postoperative anal incontinence caused by sphincter injury during the procedure. Conversely, available pharmacological therapies for Crohn's fistulae based on biologic agents such as infliximab do not generally reach ideal goal of treatment (e.g., complete closure of the fistula). A high recurrence rate after treatment with infliximab has also been reported, even after long-term maintenance therapy, which suggests that infliximab monotherapy does not provide adequate healing.\n\nThe ACCENT II study demonstraded a complete fistula healing in 25% of patients. To reach a better clinical outcome, combination treatment with infliximab and surgical intervention is highly recommended for management of Crohn's fistulae. Nonetheless, even this strategy does not result in a satisfactory healing for many patients.\n\nThe ideal therapeutic goal of treatment is not only complete closure of the fistula without recurrence but also preservation of anal sphincter function. Unfortunately, currently available medical or surgical treatment is not likely to offer a cure for perianal fistulae and, as noted above, recurrence is frequently reported.\n\nTogether with active research in the field of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, autologous or allogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been studied for management of Crohn's disease and other disorders.\n\nOf particular relevance to this study, ASCs could be considered to be safe and efficacious therapeutic tools for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. Importantly, ASCs do not cause fecal incontinence after injection into the lesion site in Crohn's disease patients. A phase I dose-escalation clinical study with ASCs manufactured by Anterogen Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) demonstrated the safety and therapeutic potential of these cells for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. A phase II study demonstrated a good rate of cronh's related fistula closure using a ASCS injection.\n\nActually the best accepted treatment of Crohn related perianal fistula, is the surgical procedure in association whit medical therapy."

            "Basic information:\n\nLipogems: Lipogems\u00ae system is a disposable device for liposuction, processing and adipose tissue reinjection. Procedure takes place in a single surgical time. It's a disposable device that progressively reduces adipose tissue clusters size, washing completely pro-inflammatory oil and blood debrides through a minimal manipulation \"free enzyme\" in a aseptic closed system completely pre\ufb01lled by room temperature physiological solution.\n\nLipogems product is a non-expanded and microfractured fat tissue ready for autologous settings.\n\nSalveColl-E: Salvecoll\u00ae is sterile bioplastic, equine derived, type I collagen material with a fully preserved fibrous structure (non-reconstructed) that ensures the regeneration of affected tissues. Type I collagen has zero risk of transmitting viral or microbial infections.\n\nRationale for the trial: To evaluate the efficacy of the use of ACSS in crohn related perianal fistulas. The aim of the study is to improve fistula healing at 1 year from 25% to 65%.\n\nTreatment of subjects At the time of fistula diagnosis the patients will be screened for eligibility and a informed consent will be administered . All patients will be underwent a loose seton placement after antibiotics prophylaxis administration with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole to obtain a pelvis sepsis resolution at time 0.\n\nAt week 4 a surgical procedure will be performed. In general anesthesia a antibiotics prophylaxis will be administrated and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be collected by LIPOGEMS system to prepare ASCS.\n\nIn the infiltration step, adrenalin in a saline solution (2 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) is infiltrated using a 19-cm specially designed disposable blunt cannula.\n\nThe vasoconstriction together with the blunt point of the cannula avoids any accidental intravascular injection and facilitates the subsequent lipoaspiration. Three hundred to 500 ml are usually injected in the chosen area for fat harvesting (usually the lower abdomen), making the tissue really \"filled\" with the injecting solution. The aspiration step (lipoaspirate) is performed by a luer lock syringe connected to a disposable 19-cm blunt cannula (3 mm OD), with 5 oval holes (1 \u00b4 2 mm). A few strokes using a standard liposuction technique are enough to harvest 6-10 ml of fat tissue. Vacuum while aspirating can be obtained manually or by clamping the syringe plunger with a clamp instrument. Up to 1,000 ml can be harvested in less than 15 min, and 1-2 min are enough. The harvested lipoaspirate can be progressively put into the device using multiple 10-cc syringes.\n\nSubsequently, in lithotomy position, a seton will be removed and a fistula tract will be thoroughly curetted and irrigated. After a mucosal flap preparing round the internal opening, cells will be injected in the perianal adipose tissue.\n\nBetween 40 and 130 ml of lipoaspirate (ideally 100 ml) are processed at each time in the standard 225-ml device. To avoid cell damage, no air should be in the device during all procedural steps and the device should be prefilled with saline before beginning the processing. The aspirated fat should be always surrounded by a liquid environment: this is essential to obtain healthy smaller fat clusters instead of oil and adipose tissue debris. The first cluster reduction was obtained by pushing the aspirated fat from the syringe into the device and through the first size reduction filter while allowing the corresponding quantity of saline to exit towards the waste bag. The final Lipogems product is then collected into 10-ml syringes connected to the upper opening of the device. The final Lipogems product is now ready for the injection in the perianal fistula.\n\nAfter a SALVECOLL-E paste injection into the fistula tract the mucosal flap will may be closed with an absorbable interrupted sutures. A external opening will be sealed with Dermabond Mini.\n\nThe patients will receive a intravenous infusion of Infliximab (Remicade) at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight at weeks 8, 10, 14 and every 8 week for a total of nine doses.\n\nRationale for treatment The ASCS injection in the perianal adipose tissue in association with Infliximab therapy, would improve a crohn related perianal fistula healing.\n\nThis association could be reduce a recurrence and reintervention rate with an improvement of quality of life.\n\nTrial population Number of subjects to be studied Planned number of subjects to be screened: 10 Anticipated number of trial sites: 1\n\nWithdrawal criteria The subject may withdraw at will at any time. The patient may be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator for safety concerns. If the patient withdraws or is withdrawn at any time after receiving trial product, final safety information will be obtained.\n\nPatients who are deemed during surgery not suitable included in this protocol will be withdrawn from the study. In case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified in the CRF.\n\nA patient withdrawn from the study will be analyzed according to evaluability of Subjects for Analysis.\n\nMethods and assessments Visit procedures\n\nThe study comprises of the following visits:\n\nVisit 1: Diagnosis, baseline visit and first surgery procedure: Screening of patient, Baseline examination, Pre-surgery and surgery assessment, Informed consent.\nVisit 2: Treatment visit: Surgery\nVisit 3: Medical treatment: start Infliximab administration\nVisit 4, 5, 6, 7,8,9: Medical treatment follow-up\nVisit 10: end of study: last infliximab dose\n\nIn case of any premature discontinuation of the trial, the patient will, if possible, be called in for a last visit. Even if the patient is not able to attend, the End of Trial Form must be completed.\n\nThe Investigator must keep a subject screening log and a subject enrolment log. These can be combined in one document.\n\nSubjects enrolled in the trial will be provided with a documents stating that he/she is in a trial, contact address and telephone numbers.\n\nIn case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified in the CRF.\n\nAll patients will be classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification as described below. No restriction regarding to ASA status will be applied in this trial.\n\nPatient Compliance The investigator will reinforce compliance with the protocol by ensuring that only patients willing to follow the trial procedures are enrolled in the trial.\n\nDefinitions adverse events\n\nAdverse event (AE):\n\nAny untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.\n\nAn adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.\n\nNote: This includes events from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol.\n\nThe following should not be recorded as AEs:\n\nPre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent.\nPre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures. These should be recorded as medical history/concomitant illness.\n\nAn AE can also be a clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity which requires active management (i.e. discontinuation of trial product, more frequent follow-up or diagnostic investigation).\n\nThe following events will not be recorded as adverse events, as such discomforts are expected to be related to the surgical procedure:\n\nPost operative nausea/vomit\nPost operative sore throat due to intubation\nPost operative pain due to surgical intervention within 3 months from the operation.\n\nSerious adverse event (SAE):\n\nA SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:\n\nDeath\nA life-threatening* experience\nIn-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nA persistent or significant disability/incapacity\n\nImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.\n\nThe term \"life-threatening\" in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.\n\nNon-serious adverse event:\n\nA non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of a serious AE.\n\nSeverity assessment definitions:\n\nMild - No or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities.\nModerate - Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities.\nSevere - Considerable interference with the subject's daily activities, unacceptable.\n\nRelationship to trial product assessment definitions:\n\nProbable: good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship\nPossible: a causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed\nUnlikely: the event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product\n\nOutcome categories and definitions:\n\nRecovered - Fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed consent.\nRecovering - The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial.\nRecovered with sequelae - As a result of the AE the subject suffered persistent and significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyzed). Any AE recovered with sequelae should be rated as an SAE.\nNot recovered.\nFatal.\nUnknown - This term should only be used in cases where the subject i"
