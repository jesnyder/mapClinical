            "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes loaded with small interference RNA (siRNA) against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with KrasG12D mutation.\n\nII. To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes loaded with siRNA against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic PDAC patients with KrasG12D mutation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of iExosomes. II. Assess the overall response rate of iExosomes in the chosen patient population.\n\nIII. Assess the disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) with therapy.\n\nIV. Determine median progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment. V. Determine the median overall survival (OS) with this treatment.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate optional tissue collection and serum-derived exosomes and circulating-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) for detection of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) showing KrasG12D sequence; evaluate DNA and RNA showing KrasG12D sequence in optional tissue collection.\n\nII. Evaluate the siRNA content in blood and optional tissue collection.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nParticipants receive mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA intravenously (IV) over 15-20 minutes on days 1, 4, and 10. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants who respond may continue 3 additional courses.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months for up to 1 year."

WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy\nA male subject of fathering potential must use an adequate method of contraception to avoid conception throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. If the partner is pregnant or breastfeeding, the subject must use a condom\nPatients must sign an informed consent and authorization indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study and the known risks involved\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nConcurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable symptomatic arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes, serious active or uncontrolled infection\nPregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation\nKnown CNS (central nervous system) disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI or computerized tomography-CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; gamma knife, linear accelerator [LINAC], or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to day 1 will be excluded"
