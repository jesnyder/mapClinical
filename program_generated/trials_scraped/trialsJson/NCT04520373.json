Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit.\nFemales becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will be recorded.\nAIS grade A or B of SCI at the time of injury with or without subsequent improvement within 1 year of injury that has progressed to a higher AIS grade with a plateau in functional improvement\nSCI must be traumatic, blunt/non-penetrating in nature and not degenerative\nFull understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with the treatment plan, including fat harvesting, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, complete physical and neurologic examination and follow-up visits and assessments\nFull understanding of the requirements of home exercise program prescribed by physical and occupational therapists.\nOnce the nature of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure is initiated the subject is willing to provide written, informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPregnant or nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant during the study period\nAIS grade of SCI other than A or B at the time of injury\nNon-traumatic SCI\nHistory of receiving mesenchymal stem cell, gene or exosome therapy for any indications\nHistory of intra-spinal infection\nHistory of superficial infection in the index spinal level within 6 months of study\nEvidence of current superficial infection affecting the index spinal level at the time of enrollment\nOn chronic, immunosuppressive transplant therapy or having a chronic, immunosuppressive state, including use of systemic steroids/corticosteroids\nTaking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other antimetabolites) within 3 months prior to study enrollment\nOngoing infectious disease, including but not limited to tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis\nFever, defined as temperature above 100.4 F/38.0 Celsius, or mental confusion at baseline\nSignificant improvement between the time of adipose tissue harvest and the time of injection, defined as improvement from AIS grade A or B to AIS grade C or greater.\nClinically significant cardiovascular (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension > 90 mmHg diastolic and/or 180 mmHg systolic), neurological (e.g. stroke, TIA) renal, hepatic or endocrine disease (e.g. diabetes, osteoporosis).\nHistory of malignancy including melanoma with the exception of localized skin cancers (with no evidence of metastasis, significant invasion, or re-occurrence within three years of baseline). Any other malignancy will not be allowed.\nHistory of blood dyscrasia, including but not limited to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and monoclonal gammopathy\nParticipation in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 3 months of study enrollment\nKnown allergy to local anesthetics of other components of the study drug\nAny contraindication to MRI scan according to MRI guidelines, or unwillingness to undergo MRI procedures\nHistory of or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, recreational use of illicit drug or prescription medications, or use of medical marijuana within 30 days of study entry\nDiagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder\nPatients with baseline depression, diagnosed by the Beck Depression Inventory Assessment\nCurrently taking riluzole for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"

            "Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs) are electrical responses recorded from the nervous system following electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve. For example, stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist produces electrical activity that travels along the sensory pathway on its way to the brain. This activity can be recorded with electrodes positioned along that pathway.",
            "Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) The NBSS was designed as an objective and validated way to assess bladder symptoms in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction as a result of spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and spinal bifida. The NBSS consists of 24 questions. The first question classifies patients by bladder management, but does not make up part of the numeric score. The remaining questions address 3 domains: incontinence, storage and voiding, and consequences. The final question is an overall quality of life question. The total score can range from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 74 (maximum symptoms).",
            "The Adult Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score\u00b9, also known as the Adult NBD score has been designed to help healthcare professionals evaluate the effectiveness of their patient's current bowel management routine by assessing the impact it has on the patient's quality of life. By having your patients answer 10 simple questions, the Adult NBD Score can help identify and quantify severity of bowel dysfunction in the adult patients. The Adult NBD score consists of 10 questions and is a symptom-score where each symptom is weighted based on its impact on quality of life. The scores from each question are added together and a total score is calculated. The maximum score is 47 while minimum is 0. Score Severity of bowel dysfunction 0-6 Very minor 7-9 Minor 10-13 Moderate 14+ Severe",
