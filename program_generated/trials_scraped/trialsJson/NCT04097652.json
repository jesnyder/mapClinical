            "Stroke is the second most important cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Currently, the standard treatment for ischemic stroke is an intravenous tissue plasminogen activator(tPA; alteplase) and/or endovascular thrombectomy. However, the therapeutic time window for these treatments is narrow. Besides, endovascular thrombectomy requires specialized stroke expertise and endovascular skills. Less than 5% of ischemic stroke patients are treated by these therapy and not all patients achieve good outcomes. There is still a lack of therapy for the reduction disability from stroke. In 2018, at least 40 clinical trials intent to treat ischemic stroke using cell therapy. In particular, MSCs have shown great potential in the reduction disability from acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Meridigen is developing UMC119-06, a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human umbilical cord for the treatment of AIS disease."
