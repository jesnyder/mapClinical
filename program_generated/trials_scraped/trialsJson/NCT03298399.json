            "This trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly cultured, autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) grown in platelet lysate-containing medium will modulate recipient T-cell immune responses and promote engraftment in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. As a phase I, dose escalation trial of autologous MSCs in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing haploidentical HCT, the main aim is to evaluate the safety of this therapy with a secondary aim to evaluate its effects on engraftment and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)."

Bone marrow (1-2 ml/kg, max 60 ml) will be collected from study participants for autologous MSC expansion a minimum of 28 days prior to first planned MSC infusion. MSCs will be expanded ex vivo in human platelet lysate to the specified dose level. All MSC infusions will be dosed at 2 x 10^6 MSCs/kg recipient weight, with first infusion given on day 0 (day of haploidentical HCT) or day +1. This phase I trial will enroll 12-18 patients with severe SCD undergoing haploidentical HCT, with subjects followed for 1 year following HCT (and MSC infusions).\n\nPrior to MSC infusions, study participants will undergo transplant conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis as follows:\n\nDay -100 to -10: Hydroxyurea 30 mg/kg PO Qday\n\nDay -9: Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 0.5 mg/kg IV\n\nDay -8: Rabbit ATG 2 mg/kg IV\n\nDay -7: Rabbit ATG 2 mg/kg IV; Thiotepa 10 mg/kg IV\n\nDay -6: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV; Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV\n\nDay -5: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV; Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV\n\nDay -4: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV\n\nDay -3: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV\n\nDay -2: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV\n\nDay -1: Total body irradiation (TBI) 200 centigray (cGy)\n\nDay 0: Haploidentical bone marrow stem cell infusion\n\nDay +3: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV\n\nDay +4: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV\n\nDay +5: Sirolimus (through day +365); mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg/dose three times per day (TID) (through day +35)"

A diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) will be made by finding of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) <25 mm Hg on right heart catheterization. In patients unable and/or unwilling to undergo cardiac catheterization, patients will be excluded with the following constellation of findings based upon presumptive diagnosis of PH (PPV of 62%): TRJ velocity >2.5 m/sec AND either N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) \u2265160 pg/ml OR 6-minute walk distance <333 m.\nUncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection in the 6 week before enrollment\nSeropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nPrevious hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)\nParticipation in a clinical trial in which the patient received an investigational drug or device or the off-label use of a drug or device within 3 months of enrollment\nDemonstrated lack of compliance with prior medical care\nUnwilling to use approved contraception for at least 6 months following transplant\nPregnant or breastfeeding females\nAllergy to any component of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) suspension (such as human albumin) and/or allergy to any drugs used in HCT conditioning regimen."
