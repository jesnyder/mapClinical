Patients were randomised into three groups and treated intrathecally (IT) or intravenously (IV) with autologous MSCs (1x106/Kg) or placebo. At 6-months, treatment groups were crossed over and patients re-treated with either MSC or placebo. During the 2-months run-in period and the 12-months after treatment, participants were followed using EDSS, 25-foot timed walking, 9-hole peg test, neurocognitive tests, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, optic coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and dynamic visual tests."
