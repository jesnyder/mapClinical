            "This is a pilot clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of expanding umbilical cord blood derived blood stem cells for transplantation using a combination of chemical factors and stromal co-culture. Bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) will be obtained from a separate bone marrow donor. One cord blood unit will be expanded by this method while another cord blood unit will be infused without manipulation. The expanded cord blood unit will help boost the initial recovery of blood counts after transplantation, though it is expected that the unexpanded cord blood unit will provide the cells which will lead to long term engraftment of blood stem cells. A third cord blood unit will be identified for standby should the cord blood unit expansion fail."

If clinical efficacy of this protocol is demonstrated, we will proceed to a multicentre clinical trial with more patients.\nThe investigators will obtain haplo-identical MSC from the bone marrow of sibling/parent/offspring of the patient. Although there will be some MSC co-infused with the cord blood cells, this has been shown to be safe in trials of MSC given for patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching of MSC and recipient has been shown to be not important. bone marrow mesenchymal stroma cells (BM-MSCs) derived from related donor bone marrow with a minimum of 2/6 HLA match have been safe for use in patients.1 If the haplo-identical MSC donor is not available, matched unrelated donor MSC would also be used.\n\nEfficacy will be assessed by the following and compared to published literature as well as historical controls:\n\nNeutrophil and platelet engraftment\nPost transplant 100-day mortality\nOverall and progression-free survival If clinical efficacy of this protocol is demonstrated, the investigators will proceed to a multicentre clinical trial with more patients."
