            "Xerostomia, or dry mouth, is a common side effect of head neck radiation. Current treatment options for radiation-induced xerostomia are generally supportive in nature. Most of these supportive interventions do not reverse xerostomia and are palliative in intent.\n\nThe investigators propose that autotransplantation of marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in salivary glands post-RT or post-chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may provide an innovative remedy to treat xerostomia and restore quality of life.\n\nParticipants can expect to be on study for up to 6 months."

            "The University of Michigan Xerostomia related quality of life scale (XeQOL) is a 15-item questionnaire about how a participants oral health affects their life. Each item is scored from 1-5 either 'not at all', 'a little', 'somewhat', 'quite a bit', or 'very much' for a total score of 15-75. Higher scores represent greater degree of symptoms.",
            "The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a 20-item questionnaire about how a participants perceive their swallowing ability. Each item is scored from 'strongly agree', 'agree', 'no opinion', 'disagree', or 'strongly disagree'. One question provides a 'global score between 1-5 where 1 is extremely low functioning and 5 is high functioning. The remaining 19 questions measure a composite score from 20-100 where higher scores represent higher degree of function.",
            "The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) - xerostomia questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire about how a participant perceives their dry mouth. Each item is visually scored on a sliding scale (100mm in length) between two extremes (Q1 and Q2 from 'not difficult at all' to 'very difficult', Q3 from 'A lot' to 'None', Q4-Q7 from 'Not Dry at All' to 'Very Dry', and Q8 from 'Not Thirsty at All' to 'Very Thirsty'. The participant places a line on the scale to mark their answer. Change between various time points can be determined based on measured distance along the scale for each answer.",
            "Unstimulated saliva production will be measured at two time points by the passive drool method over a 5-minute time frame. Participants will allow saliva to pool in the mouth and, then, with head tilted forward, gently guide saliva into a saliva collection aid attached to a cryovial. Difference in weight of the cryovial empty and after the test will represent the amount of saliva produced.",
            "Stimulated saliva production will be measured at two time points by having participants chew inert gum base to the pace of a metronome (70 beats per minute) while expectorating saliva (without swallowing) into the saliva collection aid for 5 minutes total. Difference in weight of the cryovial empty and after the test will represent the amount of saliva produced.",
            "The size of salivary glands will be measured via ultrasound at baseline and up to 6 months on study."
