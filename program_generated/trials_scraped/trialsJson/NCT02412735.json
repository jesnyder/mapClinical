            "A participant was defined as a pain responder for a given study visit if they achieved at least a 50% reduction from Baseline in the lower-back pain VAS score (average pain over 24 hours), as reported during in-clinic assessment. The participant should be qualified as a pain responder at both 12 and 24 months post-treatment, and must not have received a post-treatment intervention through 24 months' follow-up. Any participant that did not have a minimum of a visit at 3 months (Study Visit 4) was considered a non-responder for this outcome measure.",
            "A participant was defined as a functional responder for a given study visit if they achieved at least a 15-point reduction from Baseline in ODI score, as reported during in-clinic assessment. The participant should be qualified as a functional responder at both 12 and 24 months post-treatment, and must not have received a post-treatment intervention through 24 months' follow-up; any participant that did not have a minimum of a visit at 3 months (Study Visit 4) was considered a non-responder for this outcome measure.",

The participants qualified as responders if they satisfied the above conditions at the 24-month follow-up visit alone. Any participant that did not have a minimum of a visit at 3 months (Study Visit 4) was considered a non-responder for this outcome measure.",

The participants qualified as responders if they satisfied the above condition at 24 months post-treatment, and did not receive a post-treatment intervention through 24 months' follow-up. Any participant that did not have a minimum of a visit at 3 months (Study Visit 4) was considered a non-responder for this outcome measure.",
