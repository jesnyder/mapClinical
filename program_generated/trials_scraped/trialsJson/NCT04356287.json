Within each block, the 6 patients will be randomized in a 2:2:2 ratio in one of the following arms: placebo, 1 infusion of UCMSC (M0), or 2 infusions of UCMSC (M0, M3). Second infusions of UCMSC will be performed only in the absence of Treatment Related Severe Adverse Events (TRSAE). Randomization into blocks 2 and 3 will be staggered, to allow the detection of TRSAE prior to inclusion of patients in a subsequent block, i.e. the second block will be randomized only in the absence of TRSAE one month after the first infusion of all 6 patients in block one, and similarly for the third block."
