            "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function.- Hormone therapy is used to treat female hormone deficiency and results in a significant improvement, but long-term use increases cardiovascular disease or cancer risk. Other treatments do not give apparent results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and effective treatments to achieve the requirements of improving health in general and sexual health in particularly in women. AD-MSCs have been widely used as autologous and allogeneic stem cell sources to treat numerous disease recently, and they have been proven to be safe. The phase I trial showed that administration of autologous AD-MSCs at the dose of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kg patient bodyweight was safe for patients with sex hormone deficiency. The therapy introduced potential improvement in sexual and general quality of life indicating by the increased FSFI. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

            "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. They are used by multicellular organism to organize, coordinate, and regulate multiple functions of cells and tissues in the body. They are considered as chemical messenger molecules that send signals from one cell to another within or between various body parts. Hormones are responsible for regulating many physiological processes and behavioral activities such as growth and development of the body, metabolism, homeostasis of intracellular and extracellular fluid, and reproduction. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function. The phase I clinical study named \" Single-group, open-label clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for early sex hormone deficiency in middle-aged people\" showed that AD-MSC therapy for patients with hormone deficiency is safe, can improve the sexual quality of life in both men and women. A significant statistical increase of testosterone levels was observed in male patients at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month. In female patients, the FSFI was 20.70 at baseline and increased to 27.1 at 12 months after AD-MSC infusion (p<0.05). There were no significant changes in AMH, FSH, or E2 infusion compared to baseline in the 16 enrolled patients. Within those under 45 years old, FSH and E2 tended to increase at 3 months after ADSC infusion and decreased at the follow-up after 6 and 12 months. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."
