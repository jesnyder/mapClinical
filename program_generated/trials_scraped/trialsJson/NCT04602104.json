            "According to the 2012 Berlin diagnostic criteria, there are currently more than 3 million ARDS patients worldwide, accounting for about 10% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). In recent years, the incidence of ARDS has increased significantly, which has significantly increased the social and economic burden. The impact of ARDS can even be compared with tumors, AIDS or myocardial infarction. There are the basic clinical treatments, such as using various ventilation methods to improve hypoxia and choosing alternative therapies to improve renal insufficiency. Therefore, there is still a lack of specific treatment measures.\n\nExosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. Studies have confirmed that MSC-Exos can improve most of the pathological changes caused by lung infection, reduce pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, reduce alveolar inflammation, and clear bacterial infections. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of ARDS.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (hMSC-Exos) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"
