As stated in the above response, these first four (4) patients will have an initial safety follow up period of one month prior to proceeding with the treatment of further patients.\n\nFollow up: Clinical (CDAI, PDAI, and perianal examination +/- under anesthesia), and endoscopic ultrasound will be performed at the time of each treatment. MRI evaluation will be performed at screening, 4 weeks after the fourth treatment (week 16) and at 16 months, if fistula closure has not been achieved. Clinical evaluation will be performed at months 1, 3, 6, 12. Endoscopic ultrasound and MRI will also be performed as needed for symptomatic patients if an abscess is suspected.\n\nDuration of Study participation: 17 Months (Follow-up visits will be at 4, 7, 10 and 16 Months post treatment.\n\nThe Allo-hMSCs will be supplied from an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source manufactured by the University of Miami."

Patients on Coumadin will be withdrawn 5 days before the procedure and confirmed to have an INR < 1.3. Patients who cannot be withdrawn from Coumadin will be excluded from enrollment.\nBone marrow dysfunction, as evidenced by a 20% or more deviation from normal hematocrit, white blood cell count or platelet values without another explanation.\nBe an organ transplant recipient.\nClinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., patients with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curatively-treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma.\nNon-cardiac condition that limits lifespan to < 1 year.\nPatients with a highly active luminal CD, i.e., if they meet any of the following criteria: - Presence of severe proctitis (prominent friability, spontaneous bleeding, multiple erosions, deep ulcers) or very active luminal disease that requires immediate treatment, revealed by colonoscopy.\nHave anal dysplasia\nPatients that have received radiation to the pelvic/perianal area.\nPresence of abscess or other collections not drained (revealed by baseline radiologic study).\nPresence of setons unless they are removed before treatment beginning.\nRectal and/ or anal stenosis that cannot be adequately evaluated for dysplasia by Examination under anesthesia or endoscopy.\nNeed surgery in the perianal region for reasons other than fistulas at inclusion or within 16 weeks after treatment administration.\nHad a stable dose of an anti-TNF agent within the past 8 weeks before the cell treatment administration.\nTaking tacrolimus or cyclosporine and not on a stable maintenance dose for 2 weeks before the start of scheduled interventions.\nHave a history of alcohol or other addictive substances abuse within 6 months before inclusion.\nSevere uncontrolled diseases (chronic renal failure, cardiovascular, pulmonary or any systemic disease).\nAny type of medical or psychiatric disease which are considered as exclusion criteria, in the investigator's opinion.\nSubjects with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency.\nPositive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Human papillomavirus (HPV) or Herpes Virus.\nHad major surgery or serious traumatism within 6 weeks of enrollment.\nImpossibility of doing an radiological exploration (reaction to contrast material, pacemakers, claustrophobia, etc.)\nHave hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\nBe currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial.\nBe a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraceptive methods.
