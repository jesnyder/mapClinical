            "The study was discontinued by the Sponsor on 24 February 2021 due to a business decision, not related to reasons of safety or efficacy. Only data listings were created; no summary or inferential analyses were performed.\n\nSubjects were assessed during Screening and Baseline (prior to randomization) for eligibility in the study. Subjects then received a single IV dose of UNEX-42 at 20 pmol phospholipid/kg body weight, or placebo. After randomization, subjects were monitored in the hospital through 40 Weeks postmentrual age (PMA) or the time of hospital discharge (whichever came first).\n\nThe following efficacy and safety assessments occurred during the course of the study:\n\nEfficacy Assessments: incidence and severity of BPD, duration of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen therapy, duration of postnatal steroids, tracheal aspirate inflammatory biomarkers, and Respiratory Severity Score.\n\nSafety Assessments: physical examination, vital signs, adverse events, predefined complications of prematurity, clinical laboratory parameters, and chest x-ray.\n\nDose administration for Cohort 1 occurred so that there was an observational period of 3 days between dosing the first, second, and third subject to assure the opportunity for safety assessments in at least 1 subject on active treatment. In addition, enrollment between cohorts was to be paused for data review by a Data Monitoring Committee to evaluate the data available after each of the first 2 cohorts were enrolled.\n\nSubjects that completed the Post-treatment Phase (including those that were discharged from the hospital prior to 40 Weeks PMA) continued into the Long-term Outcome Phase and were assessed through 1 year of corrected age."
