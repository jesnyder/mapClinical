            "The Modified Mayo clinic performance index for the elbow measures pain, motion, stability, and daily functions. (0 to 100) Higher score means better function.",
            "Defect areas were measured as the largest defect of the common extensor tendon. Higher value means larger defect area.\n\nWith the patient supine position with the elbow in 30' flexion and full pronation, the cephalic end of the ultrasound transducer was placed on the lateral epicondyle and the long axis of the transducer was aligned with the long axis of radius. The alignment of the transducer and radius was achieved by visualizing contours of the bony structures. Multiple cross-sectional images were saved by shifting the transducer medio-laterally by 2mm at a time. Acquiring images were repeated three times.\n\nAmong the saved images, one image showing the largest defect were selected for every patients at every time points. Manual measurements of the defect area were conducted by tracking the perimeter using ImageJ 1.48 software (National Institutes of Health, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and were repeated three times by two examiners in random orders and then, averaged.",

Higher value means larger defect area.\n\nWith the patient supine position with the elbow in 30' flexion and full pronation, the transducer was placed on the proximal forearm just distal to the radial head, aligning the long axis of the transducer perpendicular to the long axis of the forearm. Viewing the round radius at the horizontal center, the transducer was shifted proximally by 2mm and multiple images were saved after the transducer passed the radial head until it slid over the prominence.
