For beta-blockade, the patient must have been on a stable dose of a clinically appropriate beta-blocker for 3 months. For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, the patient must have been on a stable dose of a clinically appropriate agent for 1 month.\nBe a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\nHave an ejection fraction \u2264 50% by gated blood pool scan, two-dimensional echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, or left ventriculogram within the prior six months and not in the setting of a recent ischemic event.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nIn order to participate in this study, a patient MUST NOT:\n\nHave a baseline glomerular filtration rate < 50 ml/min1.73m2.\nHave a known, serious radiographic contrast allergy.\nHave a mechanical aortic valve or heart constrictive device.\nHave a documented presence of aortic stenosis (aortic stenosis graded as \u2265 +2 equivalent to an orifice area of 1.5cm2 or less).\nHave a documented presence of moderate to severe aortic insufficiency (echocardiographic assessment of aortic insufficiency graded as \u2265+2).\nRequire coronary artery revascularization. Patients who require or undergo revascularization procedures should undergo these procedures a minimum of 3 months in advance of treatment within this study. In addition, patients who develop a need for revascularization following enrollment will be submitted for this therapy without delay.\nEvidence of a life-threatening arrhythmia (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia \u2265 20 consecutive beats or complete heart block) or QTc interval > 550 ms on screening ECG.\nAICD firing in the past 60 days prior to the procedure.\nHave unstable angina within 2 weeks of the planned procedure.\nHave a hematologic abnormality as evidenced by hematocrit < 25%, white blood cell < 2,500/ul or platelet values < 100,000/ul without another explanation.\nHave liver dysfunction, as evidenced by enzymes (AST and ALT) greater than three times the ULN.\nHave a coagulopathy = (INR > 1.3) not due to a reversible cause (i.e., Coumadin). Patients on Coumadin will be withdrawn 5 days before the procedure and confirmed to have an INR < 1.3. Patients who cannot be withdrawn from Coumadin will be excluded from enrollment\nHave known allergies to penicillin or streptomycin.\nHave a contra-indication to performance of an MRI scan.\nBe an organ transplant recipient.\nHave a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., patients with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curatively-treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma.\nHave a non-cardiac condition that limits lifespan to < 1 year.\nHave a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months.\nBe on chronic therapy with immunosuppressant medication, such as corticosteroids or TNF\u03b1 antagonists.\nBe serum positive for HIV, hepatitis BsAg or hepatitis C.\nBe currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial.\nBe a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraceptive methods. Female patients must undergo a blood or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to injection."
