            "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths.\n\nStem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction.\n\nThe hMSCs are able to:\n\nPrevent reperfusion injury;\nPrevent excessive fibrosis;\nReestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.\nReestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis;\nPreserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration);\nPrevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis;\nLimit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity."

Severe chronic anemia or hematocrit \u226424%. Liver function tests (total bilirubin at 3 times upper limit of normal, or creatinine level \u22653mg/dL).\nPresence of any other clinically-significant medical condition, psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality, that in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor for which participation in the study would pose a safety risk to the subject.\nParticipation in another study with an investigational drug or device within 3 months prior to stem cell administration.\nHistory within the past year of drug or alcohol abuse.\nFemales known to be pregnant, lactating or having a positive pregnancy test (will be tested during screening) or planning to become pregnant during the study.\nInability to comply with the conditions of the protocol.\nPresence of a transplanted tissue or organ or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (or the expectation of the same within the next 12 months).\nPlanned Automatic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (AICD) or CRT within the next 12 months.\nNeed for chronic intermittent inotropic therapy.\nActive myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within the first twelve months of delivery).\nPorphyria.\nAllergy to sodium citrate or any \"caine\" type of local anesthetic.\nSubject scheduled for hospice care.\nClinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination, ECG (e.g. life threatening arrhythmias, including QTc interval of \u2265550 ms) or laboratory tests at the screening assessment that would interfere with the objectives of the study or that would, in the Investigator's opinion, preclude safe completion of the study.\nAbnormal findings could include: known HIV infection or other immunodeficiency state, chronic active viral infection (such as hepatitis B or C), acute systemic infections (defined as subjects undergoing treatment with antibiotics), gastrointestinal tract bleeding, or any severe or acute concomitant illness or injury.\nAny other medical, social, or geographical factor that would make it unlikely that the subject could comply with study procedures (e.g., alcohol abuse, lack of permanent residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, or a history of noncompliance)."
