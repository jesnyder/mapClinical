            "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that affects the articular cartilage over time and is accompanied by alterations to the synovium, subchondral bone, ligaments, and menisci, as well as hypertrophy of the joint capsule.\n\nTherapies are typically palliative and only alleviate pain in a symptomatic way, failing to stop cartilage degeneration and the following breakdown of other joint structures Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to tackle the challenge of creating OA-modifying therapeutics. The potential of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose derived stromal cells fraction also known as stromal vascular fraction has recently being evaluated for chondroprotective efficacy in oa knees.\n\nThe present study was taken to evaluate Clinical Effectiveness without any doubt after administration of Non enzymatically processed adipose derived stromal cells along with platelet rich plasma in large number (140 patients) having moderate to severe knee (stage 3 and 4) with objective MRI assessment and 2 year follow up.\n\nMethods\n\nThe selection criteria included patients 50 years of age or older with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee that was defined by daily pain for the previous three months, analgesic use at least once per week, less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness, and a WOMAC score of 75 in the target knee. Grades 3 and 4 kellergen Radiographic Grading Scale of Osteoarthritis were part of the radiographic qualifying requirements. The exclusion criteria included individuals with clinically significant systemic diseases and patients with evidence of secondary knee osteoarthritis or severe osteoarthritis (joint space width-JSW 2 mm).\n\nThe WOMAC score, developed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities, is a commonly used indicator of patients' subjective ratings of pain, joint mobility, and physical impairment. With 5, 2, and 17 questions, respectively, it assesses three dimensions: pain, stiffness, and physical function. A minimum score is 0, highest score is 96. The maximum score for each subscale is 20, 8, or 68, correspondingly .\n\nIn order to measure the six-minute walking distance (6MWD), a 50 m distance was marked in an internal hallway, and participants were instructed to walk as far and as rapidly as they could during the course of six minutes. The whole distance was calculated and noted.\n\nUsing previously described procedures, antero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were taken with patients standing at a distance of 1 m from the X-Ray source, with the knee completely extended. The joint space width was measured at its narrowest point (minimal JSW). According to a prior publication this trend was indicated by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm over the trial.\n\nAntero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were acquired using the previously described techniques while patients stood 1 m away from the X-Ray source with their knees fully extended. At the joint space's narrowest point, the breadth was measured (minimal JSW). This tendency was shown by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm during the study, in accordance with a previous publication.\n\nPatients were instructed to take etoricoxib at a dose of no more than 90 mg BD after meals if their discomfort was intolerable. They were instructed to take 30 mg of codeine as needed if the discomfort persisted and to report the next day. Aside from any symptoms or indications that the patient reported, laboratory-based hematological and biochemical tests were also performed as part of the tolerance and safety evaluations.\n\nA microscopic examination of the synovial fluid was performed at baseline and two years after the surgery to check for abnormal cell counts. According to the degree to which they interfered with the subject's everyday activities, adverse occurrences were classified as isolated, intermittent, or chronic. The possible causal association between the supplement and the outcome was categorized as Definite/Possible/Probable/Non-Assessable/None. The institutional committee for stem cell research and therapy gave its approval to the project. All of the patients provided written consent to participate in the trial after receiving enough information.\n\nSVF preparation :\n\nWith the help of a 3 mm aspiration cannula and tumescent solution, about 100 ml of fat was collected from each patient's belly and put into sterile, disposable 250 ml conical centrifuge tubes. The adipose tissue underwent two PBS washes before being sonically cavitated by ultrasound at 10 mega hertz ,50 W for 30 minutes with 5-minute intervals of agitation. The SVF was then extracted as a pellet by dividing the suspension into four 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuging them at 500 g for five minutes. To get rid of any remaining enzyme, the pellet was washed twice with regular saline before being resuspended in PBS. The SVF suspension was spun at 500 g for 5 min after being filtered using a 100 m cell strainer. The extra fluid was dumped. The pellet was put back together with regular saline and passed through a 40 m cell strainer. Samples were collected in order to count the number of cells, assess their vitality, and cultivate, and define the stem cells.\n\nPRP preparation: The same donor who provided the adipose tissue's peripheral blood also provided the platelet-rich plasma. ACD Solution A was added to BD yellow top vacuum tubes with 20 ml of peripheral blood, and the tubes were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. To obtain a platelet pellet, the plasma fraction was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. After that, just 3 ml of plasma remained, which was used to resuspend the platelets."
