            "-Screening This expanded access IND was created at the request of the subject who already has his own stem cells banked at Hope Biosciences, LLC. After receiving authorization from FDA and Western IRB, the subject will be contacted and provided with a copy of the informed consent for review. The Principal Investigator or delegated staff will meet with the patient in person or by telephone and explain the study procedures (including cell infusion, and safety assessment procedures), follow-up visits, potential risks and benefits of the study, alternatives, and the voluntary nature of participation.\n\nAmple time will be given for the patient to ask questions and make a decision about participation. If consent is obtained, the principal investigator or delegated staff will collect patient's medical history and schedule the date for the Infusion 1. The informed consent process will be documented in the subject's record and will include the discussion points mentioned above. A copy of the signed informed consent will be placed in the record.\n\n-HB-adMSCs Administrations. Subject will receive a total of twelve autologous HB-adMSCs infusion of 200 million cells with a dosing interval of 28 days over a 44-week period during the first and second year of treatment. Laboratory assessments will be collected at different visits across the study.\n\nOther assessments should be completed during these visits by the Investigator and/or delegated staff to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HB-adMSCs,\n\nCollection of Medical History\nCollection of Concomitant Medications.\nCollection of Vital Signs (Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, Body Temperature, Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation). Vital Signs will be collected for 2 hours post investigational product exposure. Every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes after that. If it is indicated by principal investigator vital signs should be collected more frequently.\nCollection of Weight and Height (Height measurement is only necessary at infusion 1)\nEMG NCV is required to be completed at Infusion 1 and 7. If an EMG NCV has not been done within 28 days of these visit, the Principal Investigator will place an order to obtain it. Any EMG NCV done within 28 days of the visit as standard of care can be used for this requirement.\nPhysical Examination.\nALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) at Infusion 1 and 7.\nNeuro QOL Scale at Infusion 1 and 7.\nA video documentation of the subject will be recorded during Infusion 1 and 7 with the purpose of observing his usual forms of communication and movements.\nLaboratory Samples. A blood sample for clinical labs - CBC with Platelets, CMP, PT, PTT, INR, as well as C-reactive protein, Sedimentation Rate and Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) to be collected at Infusion 1 and 7.\n\nTelephone Encounter 24 hours after each infusion to evaluate the incidence of any Adverse event or Serious Adverse Events.\n\nFollow Up 1 Week 48. (Phone call)\n\n1. Update medical history and concomitant medications if there is any new information.\n\n2. Assess the incidence of any Adverse event or Serious Adverse Events since last infusion.\n\nInfusions 13 through 24.\n\nCollection of Medical History\nCollection of Concomitant Medications.\nCollection of Vital Signs (Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, Body Temperature, Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation). Vital Signs will be collected for 2 hours post investigational product exposure. Every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes after that. If it is indicated by principal investigator vital signs should be collected more frequently.\nCollection of Weight and Height (Height measurement is only necessary at infusion 1)\n\nEMG NCV is required to be completed at Infusion 13 and 19. If an EMG NCV has not been done within 28 days of these visit, the Investigator will place an order to obtain it.\n\nAny EMG NCV done within 28 days of the visit as standard of care can be used for this requirement.\n\nPhysical Examination.\nALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) at Infusion 13 and 19.\nNeuro QOL Scale at Infusion 13 and 19.\nA video documentation of the subject will be recorded during Infusion 13 and 19 with the purpose of observing his usual forms of communication and movements.\nLaboratory Samples.

If an EMG NCV has not been done within 28 days of this visit, the Principal Investigator will place an order to obtain it. Any EMG NCV done within 28 days of the visit as standard of care can be used for this requirement."
