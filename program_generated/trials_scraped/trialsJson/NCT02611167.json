The 45-year-old age cutoff ensures that we do not enroll juvenile PD patients.\nDiagnosis of Parkinson disease by the United Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria including the presence of 2 cardinal signs of PD plus bradykinesia. Diagnosis will be confirmed by the PI or other specialists in Movement Disorders and based on medical history, physical and neurological exams. Patients should have an asymmetric onset, unilateral symptoms and a negative pull test. (See Appendix A)\nModerate to severe microsmia (UPSIT <29).\nA modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 3 or less in the levodopa OFF state. (See Appendix B)\nDiagnosis of PD between 4 to 7 years.\nRobust response to dopaminergic therapy (defined as greater than 33% reduction in symptoms (on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; UPDRS) when measured in the ON medicine state compared to OFF state.\nIf subject is taking any central nervous system acting medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnotics) regimen must be optimized and stable for 90 days prior to the screening visit.\nA stable Parkinson's disease symptomatic therapy for at least 90 days prior to screening and not projected to require additional Parkinson's disease symptomatic therapy for at least one year from the baseline visit.\nWomen of childbearing potential will be required to use a reliable form of contraception from 30 days prior to baseline visit until 6 months after the final dose of the study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAtypical or drug-induced Parkinsonism.\nA UPDRS rest tremor score of 3 or greater for any limb.\nA Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of less than 25. (See Appendix C)\nClinical features of psychosis or refractory hallucinations.\nUncontrolled seizure disorder, defined as a seizure within the last 6 months.\nDevelopmental delay.\nChronic kidney disease defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 50 mL/min/m2.\nHepatic disease or altered liver function as defined by alanine transaminase (ALT) >150 U/L and or T. Bilirubin >1.6 mg/dl at admission.\nPresence of clinically refractory orthostatic hypotension at the screening or baseline visit defined as greater than or equal to 20 mmHg change in systolic BP and greater than or equal to 10 mmHg change in diastolic BP from sitting position to standing after 2 minutes that does not respond to medical treatment or baseline sitting BP less than 90/60.\nHistory of congestive heart failure, clinically significant bradycardia, presence of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block.\nPulmonary disease: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with oxygen-requirement at rest or with ambulation; or moderate to severe asthma.\nActive malignancy or diagnosis of malignancy within 5 years prior to the start of screening (Cancer free for at least 5 years is permitted; skin cancers, except for melanoma, are permitted).\nAny diagnosis of autoimmune disease or immunocompromised state, including chemotherapy administration within last 3 years or current immunosuppression as defined by white blood cell (WBC) <3 x 103 cells/ml.\nHistory of strokes or traumatic brain injury.\nMajor surgery within the previous 3 months or planned in the ensuing 6 months.\nClinically significant abnormalities in the Screening Visit laboratory studies.\nHistory of use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the screening visit.\nHistory of brain surgery for PD.\nUnable to return for follow-up visits for clinical evaluation, laboratory studies, or imaging evaluation.\nSubstance abuse disorder.\nActive anticoagulation treatment.\nAny other condition that the investigator feels would pose a significant hazard to the patient if enrolled or complicate the study assessments."
