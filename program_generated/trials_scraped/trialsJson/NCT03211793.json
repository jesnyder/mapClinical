            "The MANUS Trial is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

We will also evaluate changes in capillary morphology and architecture using capillaroscopy; biochemical parameters; markers for endothelial activation and injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, circulating cells including endothelial cells, hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, cytokines and growth factors, immunological responses. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 48 hours and 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 52 weeks post-treatment."
