            "This study is to identify the safety and efficacy of repeat IV(Intravenous) and IT(Intrathecal) administrations of UMSC01 in patients with MS. While anti-inflammatory drugs are routinely used for the treatment of MS by inhibiting immune responses, their effects on axon remyelination or neuroregeneration are limited. We hypothesize that combined systemic delivery of UCMSCs via intravenous injection and local administration of the cells by IT was to have safety and therapeutic efficacy for patients with MS."
