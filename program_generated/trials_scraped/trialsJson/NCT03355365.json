Study subjects are randomized in an equal fashion (1:1) to study treatment and placebo at initial randomization. Subjects in each block will be randomized into placebo or treatment group. In the second year, treated subjects will cross over to the placebo group and placebo subjects will cross over to the treated group.\n\nThe total study duration will be 3 years upon enrollment. Each study subject will be required to attend up to 18 study visits, to include 1 screening visit, 1 bone marrow visit, 1 baseline visit, followed by study visits every 2 months during the treatment period of two years (12 treatment/LP procedure visits and 2 outcome visits), and an additional follow-up visit at the end of year 3."

Additionally, no changes in disease modifying agent will be made during the course of the study.\nChange in MS symptom management treatment < 6 months prior to beginning treatment. Additionally, no changes in MS symptom management treatments will be made during the course of the study, unless there has been clinical improvement, in which case, a patient may discontinue a medication.\nStart of any new orthotic device or durable medical equipment < 6 months prior to beginning treatment or during the course of the study (patients may discontinue use of these devices during the course of the study if they show clinical improvement).\nAll patients who have ever been on Lemtrada (alemtuzumab)\nAll patients who have had any prior stem cell treatments, including HSCT\nPregnant or nursing mothers, or any woman intending to become pregnant in the next three years\nAll patients will have screening blood tests done. Only patients whose values are in the normal range as determined by the laboratory norms based on age and sex will be allowed to participate. Exceptions may be made for borderline normal laboratory values manifesting no clinical symptoms at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.\nUse of systemic chemotherapeutic or anti-mitotic medications within three months of study start date due to the possibility of interference with bone marrow procedure\nAny patients with a history of or with active malignancy\nUse of steroids within three months of the study start date, as this would suggest an active disease state\nHistory of cirrhosis due to increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) infection\nSignificantly uncontrolled hypertension because of increased risk for stroke or CNS hemorrhage.\nPatients with active thyroid disease resulting in hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (Only well controlled patients with labs in the normal range will be included) because of hormone influence on cell growth\nHistory of central nervous system infection or immunodeficiency syndromes due to increased risk of CNS infection\nPreexisting blood disease (such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or significant anemia) due to invasive nature of bone-marrow aspiration\nPrevious or current history of a coagulation disorder\nAny metal implant in the body, which is contraindicated for MRI studies\nPatients with alcohol or other substance abuse problems that may affect stem cell growth; habitual drug (including marijuana and nicotine) abusers, will be excluded from the study\nOther major disease that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would preclude participation in the study\nPatients with Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV), syphilis, HIV-1, or HIV-2.\nAny evidence of significant cognitive dysfunction based on a screening history and physical examination because it would preclude giving a truly informed consent\nPatients who are enrolled in another clinical trial for MS treatment or who have received any study drug/biologics within the last 6 months. Additionally, while in the trial, patients may not enroll in any other clinical trial for MS or any other condition.\nPatients who are anticipated to have difficultly accessing the intrathecal space related to scoliosis, obesity, or any other relevant factors determined by the PI."
