      "BriefSummary": [
            "Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic debilitating ulcerative neutrophilic condition usually affecting the skin. The pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum is poorly understood. Pyoderma gangrenosum has been estimated to have an incidence rate of 3-10 per million populations per year. Mortality estimates range up to 30%. The non-healing wounds present a significant social and economic burden on affected patients. We hypothesize that EpiFix (dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane) will be beneficial in treating patients with pyoderma gangrenosum.\n\nPotentially eligible patients will be pre-screened in clinic. The pre-screening process will include a medical history, including review of co-morbid medical problems and home medications, and a physical exam of the wounds.\n\nThe first stage of the study will involve a surgery in which the pyoderma gangrenosum wounds are going to be treated with the EpiFix. About a week later, the patient will then undergo another surgery where skin grafts will be placed on the wounds that were treated in the first surgery. In each surgery, samples of the wound will be taken, and genetic information from these samples will be studied to identify the genes that are active before and after treating the wound with EpiFix.\n\nRoutine post-surgery clinic visits will then be used to monitor the healing of the wounds and make sure that no extra medical treatment is needed. Study staff will evaluate wounds twice a week for the first two weeks, then once a week until 6 weeks. Following this, you will then be followed every 4 weeks up to 22 weeks. These visits to the clinic will include taking wound measurements, taking digital photos, asking about level of pain and evaluating development of infection. Patient consent will be obtained to take any photos."

            "In part because of its efficacy, the number of clinical indications for dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) has expanded, and a number of case reports now suggest pyoderma gangrenosum can be successfully treated with dHACM. However, the mechanisms underlying dHACM's beneficial effects is entirely unstudied. The overall goal of the proposed study is to characterize the transcriptome of a pyoderma gangrenosum wound before and after successful treatment with dHACM. We will identify certain genes or genetic pathways that are specifically targeted by treatment of a wound with dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (EpiFix). With this data, we hope to better understand the method by which EpiFix can specifically heal a wound. Ultimately, all this data will be used to identify specific findings that aid in the diagnosis and treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum. A previous IRB-approved study by Dr. Frank Lau at LSU and colleagues (unpublished data) investigated the use of EpiFix to treat wounds in 3 patients with pyoderma gangrenosum with success and minimal complications."

            "Dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) has been commercially available for nearly 15 years. dHACM has been shown to elute growth factors including platelet-derived growth factors, fibroblast growth factors (PDGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and placental growth factor (PlGF). Additionally, dHACM exerts immunomodulatory effects by releasing anti-inflammatory interleukins and factors which help regulate the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Furthermore, dHACM has also been shown to stimulate mesenchymal stem cell migration and recruitment. dHACM is routinely utilized in the management of chronic wounds including diabetic ulcer and venous ulcers."
