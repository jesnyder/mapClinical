Cell pellet will be re-suspended in UC-MSCs culture medium, cultured in tissue culture flasks and placed in CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Cells will be expanded in multilayer cell factory tissue culture flasks to reach an estimated 108 UC-MSCs that will be frozen in bags of 106 cells for subsequent thawing and administration."

If the subject is unable to give consent or he/she scores less than 24 on the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), they will be excluded from the study. The research personnel involved in the study will carefully explain the consent form to the subject. The subject will then be given ample opportunity to ask questions prior agreeing to participate. If the need arises the research personnel will be available to answer questions and address any concerns.",
