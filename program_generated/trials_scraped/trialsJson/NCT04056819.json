            "This study is a first-in-human assessment of safety of using UCMSC in patients with AMI via a combination of IC and IV stem cell administration. The novelty of the current UMSC01 treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion."

            "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world, with global deaths due to coronary artery disease estimated to increase from 7.3 million in 2008 to 25 million by 2020 WHO, 2011.\n\nThe leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic and therapeutic cascade in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is chest pain.\n\nMost patients will ultimately develop an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or fibrinolytic therapy. Basically, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of myocardial infarction (MI) presentations. Acute STEMI is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and disability.\n\nThis product is a new cell therapy product for treating AMI and produced by Ever Supreme Bio Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its effectiveness for AMI and stroke. The rats with coronary artery ligation receiving intravenous injection of UMSC01 showed significantly improved cardiac function."
