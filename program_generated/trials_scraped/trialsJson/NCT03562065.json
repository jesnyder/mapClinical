      "BriefSummary": [
            "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory disease (AD), affecting both sexes and all races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monoclonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\n\nAccording to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair mechanisms, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College London for cell manufacturing."
