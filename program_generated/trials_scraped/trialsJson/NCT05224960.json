            "Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of liver transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm, which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.\n\nIn recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees. However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, muliticenter, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240 decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group."
