Recht criterion was used for grading articular cartilage injury of knee joint, including 0-IV grade, in which: 0 grade, normal articular cartilage, no obvious abnormal signal was found; 1 grade, the layered structure of cartilage disappeared, and there were focal low signal areas, but the surface was smooth; 2 grade, the surface of cartilage was irregular, the depth of cartilage injury was less than 50% cartilage thickness; 3 grade, the surface of cartilage was heavy. The degree of injury is irregular, the depth of injury is more than 50% of the thickness of cartilage or through the whole layer, but the surface of cartilage is not completely exfoliated; Grade IV, full-thickness cartilage defect, articular cartilage injury deep to the cortex, subchondral bone exposed.",
            "Evaluation of the health-related quality of life change Measured by MOS item short from health survey(SF-36) after each cell injection. SF-36 is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 36-items measuring eight dimensions of general HRQOL: physical functioning (10 items), role limitation due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and general mental health (5 items).These outcomes will be grouped as physical component summary and mental component summary. The norm data is 0-100, the health related quality of life is increases as the scores are increased. The average score is 50.",
            "Evaluation of severity of knee symptoms Lequesne Index includes the measurement of pain (5 items), walking distance (2 items), and activities of daily living (4 items). Maximal score is 24 and higher scores represent worse function",
            "The knee society score is divided into four parts: it consists of the ''Symptoms''(25 points), the ''Patient satisfaction''(40 points), the ''Patient expectation''(15 points) and the ''Functional activities''(100 points). Each part will be evaluated separately.Higher scores indicate better knee score/satisfaction/functioning or higher expectations."
