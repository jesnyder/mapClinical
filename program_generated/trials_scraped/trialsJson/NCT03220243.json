            "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using an autologous mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) coated fistula plug in people with rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's disease. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient. Participants will be in this study for two years. There is potential to continue to monitor participants' progress with regular visits as part of standard of care. All study visits take place at Mayo Clinic and Rochester, MN.\n\nThe study visit schedule is as follows:\n\nVisit 1 (Week -6) - Screening visit: exam under anesthesia and surgery to assess eligibility of fistula tract, take fat biopsy, if eligible, and fecal diversion.\n\nVisit 2 (Week 0; Day 0), exam under anesthesia for stem cell coated fistula plug placement Visit 3 (Week 0; Day 1) Visit 4 (Week 2; Month 1) Visit 5 (Week 4; Month 1) Visit 6 (Week 8; Month 2) Visit 7 (Week 12; Month 3) Visit 8 (Week 24; Month 6) Visit 9 (Week 52; Month 12).

            "The Investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer using a biomatrix (the Gore Bio-A174; Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20 million cells. Fifteen adult patients with refractory, rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. If the participant is not currently diverted, then participants will undergo a laparoscopic diversion with a loop ileostomy. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The participants will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.\n\nParticipants will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified participants will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessed. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug. Participants will return on: Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104."
