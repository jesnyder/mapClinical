      "BriefSummary": [
            "Knee joint cartilage cells metabolize slowly, and it is difficult to repair themselves after injury. Any knee joint trauma or the progression of osteoarthritis may lead to the progression of cartilage or osteochondral defects. Compared with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), peripheral blood MSCs have better chondrogenic differentiation ability. At the same time, the mobilization of peripheral blood MSCs and the advancement of extraction technology also make it feasible to treat osteochondral damage by using peripheral blood MSCs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of surgical transplantation of autologous peripheral blood MSCs to repair knee joint \u2163-degree localized cartilage injury, and to explore a new treatment for osteochondral defects based on the foundation of the research group's previous research."
