            "To date, most AD patients who seek treatment already have neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration. At this stage of the disease, perhaps a multi-faceted approach to halt the toxicity of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and promote cell survival and/or replace lost cells would be most beneficial.Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical drug which can improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are being clinically explored as a new therapeutic for treating a variety of immune-mediated diseases.Preclinical studies of the mechanism of action suggest that the therapeutic effects afforded by MSC transplantation are short-lived and related to dynamic, paracrine interactions between MSCs and host cells.Clinical trials of MSCs thus far have shown no adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous MSC transplants. Clinical studies showed that umbilical cord derived MSC is immunologically stable and not toxic.\n\nThis study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC (Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell).This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease."
