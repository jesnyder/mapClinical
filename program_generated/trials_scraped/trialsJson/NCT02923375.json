The first eight participants will be enrolled in Cohort A and receive a CYP-001 dose of 1 million cells per kg, up to a maximum dose of 100 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. Subject to a safety review of data from Cohort A, an additional eight participants will be enrolled into Cohort B and receive a CYP-001 dose of 2 million cells/kg, up to a maximum dose of 200 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. The primary evaluation period concludes for each participant 100 days after the first dose of CYP-001. Participants will have study visits on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 100. Subsequently, participants will enter a long term follow-up period, which concludes 2 years after the first dose of CYP-001."

            "The active agent in CYP-001 is allogeneic mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-derived MSCs), which are produced using the proprietary Cymerus\u2122 platform technology. Cymerus\u2122 refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus\u2122 process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique."
