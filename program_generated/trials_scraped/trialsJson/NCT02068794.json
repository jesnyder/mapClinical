            "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of an Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce sodium iodine symporter (NIS) (measles virus [MV]-NIS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, delivered by adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). (Phase I) II. To assess the 12 month overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the tolerability of this regimen. (Phase II) II. To assess the 4 month progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) III. To assess the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)\n\nTRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging. (Phase II) II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration. (Phase II) III. To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. (Phase II) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion the development of antitumor immune response. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study.\n\nPatients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (if MSC are not available, MV-NIS may be given alone) IP over 30 minutes of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years."
