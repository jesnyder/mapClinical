            "Sexual functional deficiency affects largely the physical conditions, life and sexual quality of the patients. Hypogonadism affects about 4 to 5 million men in the US, and the incidence increases with age. In our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency."

            "Sexual functional deficiency occurs at some point in life and becomes a problematic issue in middle-aged adulthood. Regenerative medicine, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation, has developed extensively, with preclinical and clinical trials emphasizing the benefits of stem cell therapy for restoration of sexual deficiency. n our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency. In phase II, 40 males with hormone deficiency will be recruited and divided randomly into two groups (n=23 each). The group A will receive UC-MSCs intravenously at day 0 and day 90 \u00b1 7, while the group B will be infused with UC-MSCs at day 180 \u00b1 14 and day 270 \u00b1 14. Each group will be monitored for 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion. The phase II is to investigate safety and efficacy of UC-MSC infusion for the treatment of sexual hormone deficiency in males.\n\nThe primary outcome are: (1) numbers of AEs or SAEs during UC-MSC infusion and 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion; (2) Testosterone levels and sexual life quality through quantification of Aging Men Symptom (AMS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQoL-M) at day 90 \u00b1 7 and day 180 \u00b1 14 of the group A compared to those of the group B.\n\nThe secondary outcome are: (1) Testosterone levels and (2) sexual life quality through quantification of AMS, IIEF, and SQoL-M at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion of each group compared to the baseline; (3) cytokine concentration (TNFa, IFN-\u03b3, IL1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, IDO) in serum of the participants and their T cell immunophenotype at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion."

To prepare UC-MSCs for therapy, aliquots of Passage 3 (P3) UC-MSCs will be thawed and cultured to P5 to get approximately 500 million cells and dispensed to 10 million UC-MSCs/ml/vial for cryopreservation. Upon request from the clinical team, aliquots of P5 UC-MSCs will be thawed in a temperature control water bath or incubator on the infusion day. The UC-MSCs will be washed and suspended in Ringer Lactate."
