            "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) can cure many hematologic diseases. Although great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation,acute graft-versus-host disease(aGVHD) remains an important complication that occurs in 35-80% patients. The mortality of aGVHD is positively correlated with its severity. At present, glucocorticoids is still the first line treatment of aGVHD. If glucocorticoids treatment is ineffective, second line drugs would be taken, such as tacrolimus(FK506), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). However, no method could be continuously effective. The effective rates of second line treatment to aGVHD is only about 60%. The effective rates and prognosis of refractory aGVHD are even worse.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating GVHD after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of refractory aGVHD using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor is rarely reported. If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with refractory aGVHD."
