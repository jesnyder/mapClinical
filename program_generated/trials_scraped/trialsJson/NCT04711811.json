If the study subject agrees to participate in the clinical trial, after reading the document, he/she must sign it. By giving his/her signature, study subject allows the principal investigator and/or designated staff to perform the following study procedures:\n\nCollection of Medical History.\nCollection of prior (up to a week before screening) and current medications.\nEvaluation of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.\nMeasurement of Weight in lb. and Height in cm.\nCollection of vital signs, including respiratory rate, pulse rate SPO2, blood pressure and body temperature.\nCollection of laboratory samples, including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood Count and Coagulation Panel, C - reactive protein and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\nPhysical Examination by the principal investigator.\nVideo documentation of the subject walking and expressing the level of pain he/she presents at that visit.\n\nVisits 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7.
