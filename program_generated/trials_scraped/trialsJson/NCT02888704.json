            "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a type of inflammation of the skin. It results in itchy, swollen, red, and cracked skin. The symptoms typically start in childhood with changing severity over the years. The pathogenesis of AD is characterized by excessive type 2 helper T cell mediated inflammatory responses, resulting in B lymphocyte mediated increase in serum level of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Subsequent degranulation of mast cells by IgE releases various inflammatory mediators, which recruit the lymphocytes and eosinophils into the lesion.\n\nCurrent clinical management of AD includes topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants. However, these drugs have been reported to carry the risk of side-effects and severe.\n\nSeveral recent studies including ours have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could suppress allergic responses in AD. MSCs have been known to interact with cell types of both innate and adaptive immune systems, which results in the suppressive effect on proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune cells including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Indeed, a number of studies have reported that the immunomodulatory ability of MSCs can be usefully applied for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammation-related diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis. Therefore, MSCs has possibility as a new drug for AD."
