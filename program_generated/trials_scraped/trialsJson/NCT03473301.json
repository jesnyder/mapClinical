Children ages 2-5 years with cerebral palsy due to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, or periventricular leukomalacia may be eligible to participate. All participants will ultimately be treated with an allogeneic cell product at some point during the study. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms: (1) the \"AlloCB\" arm will receive one allogeneic CB infusion at the baseline visit; (2) the \"MSC\" arm will receive three hCT-MSC infusions, one each at baseline, three months, and six months; (3) the \"natural history\" arm will not receive an infusion at baseline but will receive an allogeneic CB infusion at 12 months. Motor outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, six-months, and one-year time points. Safety will be evaluated at each infusion visit and remotely for an additional 12 months after the final visit. Duration of study participation will be 24 months from the time of baseline visit. Randomization to treatment arms will be stratified by GMFCS level at study entry and etiology of CP (Stroke vs. Other)."
