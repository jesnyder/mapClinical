            "The MSQOL-54 is a comprehensive health-related quality of life measure incorporating general and MS-specific questions into a single instrument.\n\nThe developers used the SF-36 as a base and added 18 questions to address MS-specific problems, including fatigue and cognitive function.\n\nThis 54-item questionnaire provides 12 sub-scales, two summary scores, and two extra single-item measures. The sub-scales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There is no single overall score for MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores (scale scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher scale score indicates improved quality of life)."
