This will include a visual analogue score for pain (VAS), a questionnaire for the subjective Constant shoulder score, and the subjective questions of the University of California (UCLA) score. Preoperative and postoperative MRI at 12 months will be done to evaluate the quality of the rotator cuff repair."

The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of autologous mesenchymal stem cells treatment applied during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\n\nThe condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, adverse events (AEs) will be elicited using a standard non-leading questions. In addition, any signs or symptoms will be observed. All AEs will be collected as:\n\npatient's positive response to questions about their health\nsymptoms spontaneously reported by the patient\nclinically relevant changes and abnormalities observed by the Investigator (e.g. local and systemic tolerability, clinically significant laboratory measurements confirmed by repeated measurement, results of physical examinations).\n\nClinical improvement will be measured by clinical outcome scores (Constant shoulder score and UCLA Shoulder rating scale) at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after the surgery. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) findings made preoperatively and at 12 months (1 year) after operation will be evaluated.\n\nDuring the indication visit, patient's history will be taken and preoperative MRI evaluated. Written consent form will be collected from the patient after detailed education of the patient by the investigator."
