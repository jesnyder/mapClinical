            "Stroke is the main cause of adult health damage. 20% of stroke survivors need institutional care after 3 months, and up to 30% of them have severe or permanent disability. Stem cells are a kind of pluripotent cells with the ability of self replication. The self-renewal and differentiation characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, as well as cytokine secretion effect and immune characteristics, provide the possibility for mesenchymal stem cells to treat ischemic stroke. After the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells, the secretion of soluble media including growth factors and cytokines may be the main mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells."
