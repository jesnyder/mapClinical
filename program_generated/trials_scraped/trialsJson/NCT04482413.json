            "This is a phase 2b randomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled study with 2 treatment arms, to compare the efficacy and safety of AstroStem vs. Placebo treatment in patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease(AD). Eligible patients diagnosed with AD within one year of the start of treatment will be enrolled. Patients who are randomized into the treatment group will be administered via intravenously AstroStem every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 36. On the other hand, patients who are randomized into the placebo control group will receive Placebo every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 36. After the final administration, patients will be scheduled for two follow-up visits, at Weeks 44 and 52, to assess efficacy and safety endpoints."
