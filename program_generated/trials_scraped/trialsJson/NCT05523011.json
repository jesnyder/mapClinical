            "This phase 1 study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the application of the MSC exosome ointment with repeated topical application on adult healthy subjects (TID from Day 1 to 20). The results of this study were to provide the first clinical information on the drug's safety and inform the selection of administration of exosome ointment to be evaluated in subsequent clinical studies. The endpoints included to assess the safety and tolerability of exosome ointment for topical application in healthy adult volunteers are:\n\nFrequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)\nThe incidence rate of local skin responses (LSR, i.e., erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, erosion/ulceration, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, and scarring) [Time Frame: Days 1 and 21]\nChanges from baseline in blood parameters (including hematology, chemistry, and other inflammation parameters such as C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) [Time Frame: Days 1 and 21]"

            "This study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki, Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines, applicable International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThis was a Phase 1, single-center, open-label study. After signing an ICF, subjects underwent screening procedures on Day 1 prior to the first study product application to determine eligibility. Once eligible, all subjects (n=10) received topical treatment with the MSC exosome ointment immediately followed by Vesiderm liposome cream TID on the forearm with a gap of 4 hours between doses.\n\nThe study consisted of the following periods:\n\nA Screening Period of 1 day (Day 1)\nA Treatment Period of 20 days (Day 1 to 20)\nAn End of Study (EOS) Period of 1 day (Day 21 [+3 days]).\n\nScreening Period\n\nThe subjects were screened for eligibility on Day 1 prior to the application of the study product. Subjects were asked to sign the ICF after having the study described to them. After obtaining written informed consent, subjects underwent the following screening procedures for participation in the study:\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria assessments\nVital signs\nMedical history\nDemographic data review\nStandard hematology panel\nRenal panel\nLiver function test\nInflammatory blood examinations\nPregnancy test (if applicable)\nConcomitant medications\n\nIdentification, visual assessment, and photography of application area\n\nA trained expert evaluator (an Investigator or designee) identified the area of study product application and performed visual assessments which were carried out using an adapted version of SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scale and visual assessment score (VAS). A photograph of the area of application was also taken using a dedicated compact digital camera at the clinic where subject visits were done.\n\nTreatment Period\n\nAfter confirmation of the application site, the subjects applied exosome ointment along with Vesiderm liposome cream (TID per day). Each day (from Day 1 to 20), the study product was applied with a gap of 4 hours between each dose to a healthy area (one hand area) on the forearm using 1 fingertip unit (FTU). The Vesiderm liposome cream was meant to keep the application site moisturized.\n\nAll through the treatment period, the subjects completed the Subject Diary to capture adverse events (AEs; skin-related and other), concomitant medications, and time of study product application.\n\nThe site coordinator called the subjects every 3 days (Days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) to follow up on the investigational product's (IP) compliance, and if subjects had any adverse events or had taken any concomitant medications during the period. Any AEs reported by the subject during the calls were to be referred to the investigator for appropriate review and follow-up.\n\nEnd of Study (EOS) Period\n\nThe EOS period was on Day 21 (+3 days). The subjects visited the clinic on this day for the assessments such as vital signs, blood examinations (hematology, chemistry, and inflammatory blood examinations), photographs of the area of application, visual assessment of the area of application, AEs, and concomitant medications used.\n\nThe assessments at this visit were also to be conducted in case of early termination or withdrawal of any subject."
