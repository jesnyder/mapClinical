            "***At this time, we are only enrolling at Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH)/Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and are not shipping cells outside of BCM/HMH.***\n\nThis is a study for patients who have respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that have not gotten better. Because there is no standard treatment for this infection, patients are being asked to volunteer for a gene transfer research study using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).\n\nStem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific function in the body. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown from bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of bones). Stem cells can develop into other types of more mature (specific) cells, such as blood and muscle cells.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if MSCs versus controls can help to treat respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2."

We'll use a computer to put the patient into study group A (study drug) or group B (control) by chance (randomized). Patients randomized to the control group, will receive the standard treatment for their respiratory infection.\n\nOn the day that the patient is scheduled to receive the cells they will be pre-medicated with Benadryl and Tylenol. The patient will then receive an intravenous (into the vein) infusion of 1 x 10^8 cells/kg of MSCs. The patient will be monitored closely for two hours after the infusion. The patient will receive a second infusion at the same dose within 3-5 days of the initial infusion (at the discretion of the investigator) if there is no improvement in respiratory parameters or if there is a worsening of Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nThe patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusion(s) and afterwards. As part of the research study, the patient will be evaluated daily for 7 days and then weekly at weeks 2, 3, and 4. The evaluations that will be done at these visits include:\n\nPhysical exam and history\nSARS-CoV-2 test\nBlood tests\nChest X-ray or chest CT Scan"
