            "The measure of safety used in this study are routine clinical procedures. They include a close vigilance for, and stringent reporting of selected local and systemic reactions, adverse events including serious adverse events.\n\nAfter 4th rehabilitation visit to study termination, only AEs of special interest and serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal from the study and concomitant medications used to treat adverse events will be collected. The AEs of special interest related directly to the state of the knee after intraarticular administration will be: excessive warming of the knee, pain, suffusion, hematoma, knee locking, decrease ROM.\n\nThe prevalence, duration and severity of AEs of special interest will be additionally analyzed in the study.",
            "The numerical scale is one of the most commonly used pain scales in medicine. The NRS consists of a numeric version of the visual analog scale. It is labeled from 0 to 10, with 0 being \"no pain\" and 10 being \"the worst pain imaginable\". This scale can help guide the diagnostic process, track the progression of the pain, and more.\n\nPatients will report intensity of pain only in knee subjected to the treatment in the study.",

It comprises 36 questions which cover eight domains of health: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); 8) general health perceptions.",

It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)\n\nThe five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures.\n\nOnly knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by KOOS survey.",
            "Change in IKDC Questionnaire score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.\n\nOnly knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by IKDC 2000 survey."
