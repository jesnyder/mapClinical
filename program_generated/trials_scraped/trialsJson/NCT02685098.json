            "This is a phase I single center open label trial study that will enroll twenty-six (26) patients requiring semi-elective lower extremity major amputation within a 30 day period for non-infectious complications related to critical limb ischemia (CLI). After enrollment patients will be scheduled for amputation 7 days after MSC administration. The investigational treatment uses allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at the point of care. Allogeneic MSCs will be injected in the gastrocnemius muscle and anterior tibialis muscle of twenty-six (26) patients undergoing major amputation. Through a review of treatment related adverse events over 6 months we will test the hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs do not result in significant cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious treatment related adverse events. Through an exploratory investigation we will assess the efficacy of MSCs in promoting freedom from gangrene, revision of amputation, and death after major amputation."

      "PrimaryOutcomeDescription": [
            "Treatment-related adverse events will be categorized in overlapping systems of cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious and severities of serious adverse events (SAE) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The sum and difference between routes of delivery will be reported. Confidence intervals will be generated and summarize the data by the method of the Wilson Score Interval. Binomial confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level and p-values for these groups will be calculated. Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore the effect of administration of MSCs on the composite endpoint at 6-months of death, amputation revision and gangrene, and will be compared to historical cohorts. The critical levels for the multiplicity adjustment will be determined by simple Monte Carlo simulation.Unanticipated SAEs and those affecting the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects will be documented and reported immediately upon discovery."
