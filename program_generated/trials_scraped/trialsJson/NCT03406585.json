The second part is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase I/II study in parallel design comparing allogeneic WJMSC treatment to placebo in adult patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Besides safety, preservation of endogenous insulin production (measured as C-peptide concentrations) together with metabolic control, diabetes treatment satisfaction and immunological profile will be assessed.\n\nA total number of 24 patients will be enrolled in the study and followed for one year after WJMSC/placebo treatment. Patients 18-40 years of age, both male and female, diagnosed for type 1 diabetes will be eligible. Providing informed consent and fulfillment of inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, they will within two years of diagnosis be randomized."
