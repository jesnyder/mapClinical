            "In this clinical trial, the investigational product is administered intra-articularly at 1 week after high tibial osteotomy in a patient with degenerative arthritis of the medial side.\n\nThe investigational product is autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissue and is incubated without additional genetic modification or mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.\n\nIt primarily aims to regenerate cartilage, to improve pain and joint function. The intra-articular injection of the investigational product is expected to stimulate the regeneration and growth of cartilage, and to innovatively improve pain and joint function with cartilage regeneration compared to high tibial osteotomy alone."
