            "The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a viral disease that infects the lungs, producing flu-like symptoms. Elderly infected patients and/or those with co-morbidities may suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pneumonia (COVID-19 disease). Given the high transmission, this virus has spread in recent months from Wuhan (China) to the whole world, becoming a global emergency pandemic. The lack of curative treatment for this disease justifies the need to carry out clinical trials that provide quality evidence on treatment options. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, which involves an uncontrolled inflammatory response of alveolar cells, a treatment that attenuates the cytokine cascade could be key in rescuing the patient's lung tissue. Mesenchymal cells, due to their immunoregulatory potential and regenerative capacity, can be an effective treatment for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nIn the present study we propose a therapy with undifferentiated allogeneic mesenchymal cells derived from umbilical cord tissue, a treatment whose safety has already been described in other clinical trials and that shows promising results in pilot studies carried out in China."
