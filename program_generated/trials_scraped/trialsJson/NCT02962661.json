Will provide confidence intervals of the differences in change from baseline between each investigational group and the control group. If both investigation groups are significant at the p < .05 level, then the two investigational drugs can be compared using a gatekeeping procedure. These intervals and the associated p-values will be calculated using two-sample t-tests, with no adjustments for multiple comparisons.",
