            "Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function. Today, there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and in more advanced stages the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells found from embryonic mesoderm and found in all tissues. In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. Our approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction."

However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nExperimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and are found in all structural tissues of the body.\n\nIn the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.\n\nAmong the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017) that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial."
