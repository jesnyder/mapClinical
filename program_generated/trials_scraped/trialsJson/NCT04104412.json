T2-weighted mri of the lumbar spine showed decreased single/multisegment signal in the intervertebral disc (black disc sign) or High intensity zone (HIZ) in the posterior part of the intervertebral disc annulus. The clinical signs of nerve localization were consistent with MRI changes.\n\nThe efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCS) were evaluated by low-temperature plasma ablation and intravertebral disc injection, which were divided into treatment group and control group.\n\nThe safety evaluation including:physical examination, vital signs, routine hematuria and faeces, liver and kidney function, blood lipids, electrolytes, coagulation, rapid virus detection, tumor markers, electrocardiogram and adverse reaction records at the 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks before and after treatment.\n\nThe prime efficacy evaluation is VAS( visual analogue scale) at the 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks before and after treatment."
