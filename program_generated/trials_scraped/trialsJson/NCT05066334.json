            "DREAM is a phase II B efficacy monocentric, prospective, randomized, controlled double blinded trial, comparing intra-discal autologous adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) therapy and sham treated controls in subjects with chronic (> 6 months) Low Back Pain (LBP) due to lumbar multilevel (max. 3 levels) intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) unresponsive to conventional therapy.\n\nDuration of the recruitment period has been estimated to be 12 months. The efficacy of intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC in reducing chronic LBP due to multilevel lumbar IDD will be evaluated after 24 months in terms of pain relief (VAS), functionality (ODI) and quality of life (SF36)."

            "Low back pain (LBP) is the global leading cause of disability, and furthermore rates sixth in terms of overall disease burden, in both developed and developing countries. LPB is a condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age, and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP will increase substantially over coming years.\n\nCurrent LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment. Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.\n\nIn a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby causing biomechanical functional failure.\n\nToday, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this common and debilitating disease.\n\nThe objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years."

Contraception will be maintained during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure. Additional pregnancy testing will be performed at the end of relevant systemic exposure. The patients will be required to use contraception from initial treatment administration until 24 months after the last dose of study drug.\nIn each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruations) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended.\nPositive serology for following infection: Syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B, or C.\nContraindication to MRI assessed by the investigator.\nIntolerance or allergy to local anaesthesia.\nAny history of Cancer or immunodeficiency disease.\nPrevious transplantation."

SF-36 scores consist of eight 0-100 scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health) where a lower score corresponds to more disability and a higher score corresponds to less disability.",
            "Quality of life evolution includes global assessment by the patient and the physician.\n\nThe global assessment by the patient and the physician involves evaluation of: - Overall pain intensity in the lumbar spine (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = extreme); - patient's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor); - physician's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor).",

The other categories include retired, disabled, and elderly at least 60 years of age, eligible for social security.",

The \"quality\" of the patient's lumbar disc/discs will be monitored non invasively using T2 weighted MRI sagittal images and, in T1 spin/echo MRI. Lumbar disc grading will be performed in the sagittal T2 weighted images by two physicians independently who were experienced in MRI of the spine. They will review each intervertebral disc from L1-2 to L5-S1 by the modified Pfirrmann criteria. The modified Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade 1 to 8 for disc degeneration.",

For this purpose, resource use in each arm will be collected in physical units in the eCRF (electronic case report form) at the clinical centre as follows:\n\nAcute care medical hospitalisations related to IDD\nAcute care surgical hospitalisations related to IDD\nRehabilitation hospitalisations related to IDD\nAnalgesics\nWork disruption",

For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine biochemical parameters (Electrolytes, Creatinine, ALT, AST, AP, Bilirubin) to monitor the metabolic function of liver and kidney.",
