All items are assumed to impact QoL and must be answered to compute scores for each dimension. Questions are answered based on experiences from the preceding month using a 5-point ordinal scoring system: 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always.

Scores for each symptom are added up to obtain the total scores for all 21 items. Total score ranges from 0-63; of which 0-8 is considered no depression, 0-13 is minimal depression, 14-19 is mild depression, 20-28 is moderate depression and 29-63 is severe depression.",
