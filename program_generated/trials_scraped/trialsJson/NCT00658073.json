            "Renal transplantation is the most common and successful type of organ transplantation. Induction therapy with antibody plus the maintenance immunosuppressive agents have greatly improved graft survival in renal transplantation. Since mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s), we evaluate autologous MSCs as an alternative for antibody induction therapy. Moreover, we examine if MSCs could improve the recovery of early function in transplanted kidney."
