            "Crohn's disease has several phenotypes (inflammatory, stricturing, fistulizing) and location (small bowel, ileocecal, colon, and perianal). Approximately one third of patients have inflammation limited to the colon. Up to two thirds will become medically refractory and require a total abdominal colectomy for symptom control. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) delivered by targeted endoscopic delivery to treat people for medically refractory Crohn's colitis."

This will be injected into the submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.\n\nPatients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.\n\nThere will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150 million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24 participants.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory Crohn's colitis."
