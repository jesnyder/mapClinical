            "In this study, we will use autologous 'ischemic' serum that obtained at the earliest time point as possible (immediate after randomization) for the purpose of ischemic preconditioning. We have recently conducted preclinical studies on the effects of ischemic preconditioning on the MSC functions. We have evaluated the characteristics of rat MSCs after culture with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum obtained from rat stroke model. Compared to FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity."
