            "Dosage and administration method: Fifteen subjects received umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy 3 times. Approximately 1 \u00d7 106/kg of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were administered by peripheral intravenous infusion once a month at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Routine medications were used.\n\nFollow-up: Patient follow-up was performed 7 times at 0, 4, 8, 20, 32, 48, and 60 weeks. Blood and urine were collected for determination of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-h urine protein ratio, liver and kidney function, fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, eGFR, blood lipids, and blood electrolytes at each follow-up visit. The daily dose of insulin was recorded. Blood samples were taken after each infusion of stem cells for flow cytometry and for the detection of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28+, Treg, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, CD83, and CD1a cells. Plasma levels of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, IL-12P70, IL-8, and IL-1 beta were also determined.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy within 60 weeks): The number and severity of adverse events, an evaluation of their association with the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell treatment, and the outcome of the adverse events.\n\nThe patients' discomfort and clinical symptoms during the study period were recorded.\n\nThe subjects' relevant laboratory test indices, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination results were recorded during the study.\n\nSecondary endpoint indicators:\n\nEfficacy measures: eGFR, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and percentage changes of 24-h urinary protein quantities from baseline to 60 weeks.\n\nData analysis:\n\nThe number of adverse events and the number of severity adverse events were determined based on the changes in the data summary (i.e., descriptive statistics).\n\nA multilevel statistical analysis model (mixed effects model) was used to infer the relationship between treatment factors and key indicators, reflect the changing trend of key indicators in different time periods, and draw statistical analysis conclusions."
