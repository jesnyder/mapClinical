            "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nNon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

            "This is a Pilot Study, intended as a safety assessment prior to a full comparator study. In this Pilot Study, cells administered via the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA injection catheter system will be tested in 36 patients in two groups:\n\nGroup 1 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Auto-hMSCs: 20 million cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108 (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.\n\nGroup 2 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Allo-hMSCs: 20 million cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108 (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.\n\nThe first three (3) patients in each group (Group 1 and Group 2) will not be treated less than 5 days apart and will each undergo full evaluation for 5 days to demonstrate there is no evidence of a procedure induced myocardial infarction or myocardial perforation prior to proceeding with the treatment of further patients.\n\nPatients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups.\n\nTreatment Strategies: Autologous hMSCs vs. Allogeneic hMSCs. The Study Team will record and maintain a detailed record of injection locations.\n\nIf a patient is randomized to Groups 1 (Auto-hMSCs) and the Auto-hMSCs do not expand to the required dose of 1 X 108 cells, each injection will contain the maximum number of cells available.\n\nThe injections will be administered transendocardially during cardiac catheterization using the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Catheter System.\n\nFor patients randomized to Group 1(Auto-hMSCs); the cells will be derived from a sample of the patient's bone marrow (obtained by iliac crest aspiration) approximately 4-6 weeks prior to cardiac catheterization. For patients randomized to Group 2 (Allo- hMSCs), the cells will be supplied from an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source manufactured by the University of Miami. The Allo-hMSCs for patients in group 2 will be administered after all baseline assessments are completed with an expected range of 2 - 4 weeks post-randomization.\n\nFollowing cardiac catheterization and cell injections, patients will be hospitalized for a minimum of 2 days then followed at 2 weeks post-catheterization, and at month 2, 3, 6, and 12 to complete all safety and efficacy assessments."
