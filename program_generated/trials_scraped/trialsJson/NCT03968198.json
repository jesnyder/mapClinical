            "Different types of stem cells have recently been studied in clinical trial on ischemic disease of the heart and muscular arteries. Adipose derived stem cell, have shown in vitro and in vivo models a stronger potential of success in recovering from ischemic disease and oxygenation of the tissues. The investigators already shown in a phase I study, that adipose derived mesenchymal cells injected in patients with critical limb ischemia and no option for revascularization, had a very good tolerance and interesting effects on skin oxygenation and healing.\n\nThe aim of the present clinical trial is to confirm the efficacy autologous transplantation of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal cells in patients with critical limb ischemia with poor options or no option for revascularization."

            "Lower limbs arteries are a frequent localization of atheroma in elderly people (15-20% after 70 years). The most severe stage of the disease, critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined clinically by the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer, has a dramatic prognosis at 12 months, with 30% of the patients alive with an amputation, 20% mortality and only 20% of patients with a resolved disease, independently from the treatment. The only validated treatment for this disease is revascularization by endovascular procedures or open surgery. Patients with no option or poor option (high risk) for revascularization have the worst prognosis.\n\nCurrent research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide revascularization and oxygenation of the tissues. A specific form of stem cells, called Adipose-derived Stem/Stroma Cells (ASC), has shown promise for recovering from ischemic disease like critical limb ischemia (CLI) in preclinical trial and trial in phase I. This study will confirm the efficacy autologous transplantation of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal cells in patients with critical limb ischemia with poor options or no option for revascularization.\n\nThis study is a phase II, prospective, multicentric, open trial and no comparative. A maximum of 43 patients will be included in two-stage to receive 90*106 intramuscular injection of ASC. Patients will be followed-up for 6 months.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the number of patients alive without major amputation and without critical limb ischemia (defined as the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer and ankle pressures less than 70 mmHg or toe systolic pressure less than 50 mmHg or TcPO2 of less than 30 mmHg, at six month).\n\nThe secondary endpoints are to evaluate:\n\nthe number of new vessels in the treated limb by standardized angiographic magnetic resonance\nthe blood flow by laser Doppler, transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2), ankle pressure\nthe percentage reduction of wound surface and percentage of complete ulcer healing\nthe pain reduction by standardized evaluation (visual scale and drug consumption)\nthe percentage of wound infection and irritative dermatitis (expected adverse events)\ninterleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-12, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03b1)measurements in blood samples\nMesenchymal stem cells MSC trophic factors and immune- modulators (Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), Human Leucocyte Antigen G (HLA-G)) in vitro."
