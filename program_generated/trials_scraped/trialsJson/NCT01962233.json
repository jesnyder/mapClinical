            "To date,hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is refractory, including after carbon monoxide poisoning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,hemorrhagic shock and cerebral infarction etc. We used Mesenchymal Stem Cells via portal vein infusion method to treat hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. With different durations of follow-up, we cleared therapeutic effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of the cord blood stem cell infusion on hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and evaluated the adverse reactions, through the neurological function score (NIHSS\uff0cBarthel Index), cognitive score (MoCA, MMSE),and the international uniform Parkinson Rating Scale score (UPDRS). Here, we seek new means for the treatment of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and provide the basis for clinical for further application of umbilical cord blood derived Mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nOn the basis of conventional therapy, at the same time, selected patients were given by intravenous infusion of umbilical cord blood stem cells 100-800 million. All patients before treatment, after treatment for 15days, 90days and 180 days were evaluated respectively the curative effect. The neurological function score (NIHSS score, Barthel Index) was observed in patients with the ability to live independently and prognosis; MoCA, MMSE were used in the evaluation of cognitive function \uff1bUPDRS was used in the evaluation of extrapyramidal tract function."

            "The Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) is a brief 30-point screening instrument that was developed and validated to identify subjects with mild cognitive impairment. 30 is the maximum score, with a score of 26 or higher considered normal and below 26 indicative of Mild Cognitive Impairment.",
            "The UPDRS score has 4 components. Part I assesses mentation; Part II assesses activities of daily living; Part III assesses motor abilities; Part IV assesses complications of therapy. A total of 44 items are included in Parts I-III. Each item will receive a score ranging from 0 to 4 where 0 represents the absence of impairment and 4 represents the highest degree of impairment. Part IV contains 11 items, 4 of these items are scored 0-4 in the same manner, and 7 are scored 0-1, with 0 indicating the absence of impairment and 1 indicating the presence of impairment. Total UPDRS score represents the sum of these items in Parts I-IV. A total of 199 points are possible. 199 represents the worst (total) disability), 0--no disability.",
