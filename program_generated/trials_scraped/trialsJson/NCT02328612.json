A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter outside the reference range may be included only if the investigator judges that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures\nMale aged between 18 and 35 years, inclusive at the time of signing the informed consent\nMale subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) must agree to use barrier contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in activity in which conception is possible while on study medication and for at least 28 days after taking the last dose of study medication\nMust understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form prior to the conduct of any study related assessment/procedures. Capable of giving written informed consent and able to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the study:\n\nSubject has had a major illness in the past 3 months or any significant chronic medical illness that the investigator would deem unfavourable for enrolment, including inflammatory diseases\nSubjects with a history of malignancy\nSignificant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition including, but not limited to, renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological, cerebral psychiatric disease, or evidence of demyelinating disease\nSubject uses tobacco products\nSubject has a history, within 3 years, of drug abuse (including benzodiazepines, opioids, amphetamine, cocaine, THC, methamphetamine)\nHistory of alcoholism and/or drinking more than 5 units of alcohol per day\nAny clinically relevant abnormality noted on the 12-lead ECG as judged by the investigator or an average QTc > 450 msec\nThe subject has received an investigational product within three months prior to day 1 of the current study\nUse of prescription or non-prescription drugs and herbal and dietary supplements within 6 months unless in the opinion of the investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety\nTransfusion of blood or blood products within 6 months prior to the inclusion in the study.\nSubject has difficultly in donating blood or accessibility of a vein in left or right arm.\nSubject has donated more than 350 mL of blood in last 3 months\nBody mass index >28 kg/m2\nPresence of a severe bleeding or thrombotic disorder\nHistory of known pulmonary embolism or known secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome\nSubjects known or suspected of not being able to comply with a study protocol (e.g. due to alcoholism, drug dependency or psychological disorder)\nKnown allergies or hypersensitivity to antibiotics, HSA, DMEM, materials of bovine origin, and Ringer's Lactate Solution\nAny other issue that, in the opinion of the investigator, could be harmful to the subject or compromise interpretation of the data."
