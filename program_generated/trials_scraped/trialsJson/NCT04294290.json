Toddlers 18 to 48 months of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD will be eligible to participate. Diagnosis will be confirmed at the time of the eligibility visit at the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development. All participants will receive a single intravenous dose of 2x106/kg hCT-MSC per kilogram at baseline. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 6 months, with remote follow-up assessments at 12 months."

            "The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility. Safety assessments include monitoring of acute infusion reactions, adverse events, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization. Clinical outcome measures will also be described. A key clinical outcome measeure is the change in social communication abilities from baseline to 6 months based on the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI), a commonly-used and well-validated coding system for rating the quality and quantity of social communication skills in toddlers with and without ASD.91 JERI coding rates social communication abilities on a 1 to 7 scale and factors in both the quantity and quality of skills. The total joint engagement score as well as ratings on all JERI subscales that comprise the total score will be described.\n\nOther clinical endpoints will include the PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) autism composite score, the mean of the Socialization Subscale Standard Score and Communication Subscale Standard Score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) - Severity and Improvement Scales, the Communicative Development Inventories (CDI-2): Words & Sentences subscales, attention abilities via eye-tracking, and brain activity.\n\nExploratory clinical endpoints will include autism symptoms measured by an app that elicits and records autism symptoms on an iPad (SenseToKnow), Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) Calibrated Severity Score (overall, social affect, and repetitive behavior), PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) Subscales, and VABS-3 Standard Score and age equivalent for the following subscales: Socialization, Communication, and Daily Living and the Standard Score and age equivalent for the VABS-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite.\n\nSafety and VABS-3 assessments will also be conducted remotely at three and 12 months. Duration of study participation will be 12 months from the time of the baseline infusion."
