            "This study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled study with two arms to evaluate JointStem as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening period, approximately 30 subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the following two arms in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 positive control). After each subject completes 6-month visit (Visit 6) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.Only subjects who are assigned will be requested to visit the study center for 9-month and 12-month follow-up visits (Visits 7 and 8). To see long-term effects of JointStem, all subjects who complete Visit 6 will be requested to visit the study center at 24-month after the injection."

The main radiological features evaluated were bone marrow edema, osteophytes, and cartilage. Certain features, such as the appearance of a new cartilage defect or increase in the size of existing cartilage defects or osteophytes, is generally considered an indication of osteoarthritic progression. Similarly, the diminishing in severity or size of existing abnormalities would generally be considered to be a healing(improving) response."

The main radiological features evaluated were bone marrow edema, osteophytes, and cartilage. Certain features, such as the appearance of a new cartilage defect or increase in the size of existing cartilage defects or osteophytes, is generally considered an indication of osteoarthritic progression. Similarly, the diminishing in severity or size of existing abnormalities would generally be considered to be a healing(improving) response.",
