Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered, and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit. Persons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome.

This includes known allergy or contraindications to products of bovine origin (including aprotinin) or hypersensitivity to antibiotics, if the latter are used in the manufacturing process\nAny contraindication to MRI scan according to MRI guidelines, or unwillingness to undergo MRI procedures\nAny illness or condition which, in the investigators' judgement will interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results\nHistory of coagulopathy, including bleeding diathesis and deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism."

            "Cartilage cells are being used from the rim of the defect in the hip and recycled to help make new cartilage in the hip. There are not enough cartilage cells to fill the defect so cartilage cells need to be mixed with MSCs. MSCs or Mesenchymal Stem Cells are naturally occurring cells that provide growth factors and cell signals that play a role in tissue repair. MSCs can be found in bone marrow and in the fatty tissues (i.e., area under the skin of the belly or breast) of patients. Fibrin glue is a product made from the naturally occurring compounds in blood which cause clotting. This glue hardens into a gel-like substance into which cells such as cartilage cells (chondrons) and AMSCs can be placed."
