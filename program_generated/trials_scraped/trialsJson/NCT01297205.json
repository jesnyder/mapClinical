            "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is most common cause of death of children who were born prematurely, with low birth weights. In addition, many children who were recovered from this disease are suffering from many side effects such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nThe purpose of BPD treatment is to make a baby be able to do spontaneous breathing and to spontaneous breathing a baby needs much energy and because of this a baby may have difficulty to feed. For this reason, medication with steroid, diuretic and respiratory drugs are currently used. However, there is no effective cure so far.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate to pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSC differentiated to bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae is human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells and it is intended to treat premature infants with BPD. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of this study drug and to establish the maximum toxicity dose. The latent efficacy will also be assessed."
