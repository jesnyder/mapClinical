      "BriefSummary": [
            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as disease-modifying agents (DMDs).\n\nUnfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the deleterious immune reactions. According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS, an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune process, to protect axons and neurons from degeneration, and to enhance repair and facilitate remyelination.\n\nA specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown remarkable ability to modulate the immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs in people with MS."

There is an urgent need to evaluate the real efficacy of MSC transplantation, and its possible position in the current therapeutic armamentarium. An international panel of MS neurology and stem cell experts, as well as immunologists formed an \"International Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation\" (MSCT) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism that underlie the benefit. 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells. Clinical and objective evaluations will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up."
