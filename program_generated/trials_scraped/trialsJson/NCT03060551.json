            "In order to assess the severity of microangiopathies in both fingers, a semiquantitative scoring system for nailfold capillary microscopic findings was adopted. A total of six parameters (irregularly enlarged capillaries, giant capillaries, hemorrhages, loss of capillaries, disorganization of the vascular array and capillary ramifications) were measured using the semiquantitative manner on the scale ranging 0 to 3, indicating more severe as scores were higher. Each parameter was scored for four fingers of both hands, except thumbs, and the median score value of each parameter in both hands was finally presented.",
