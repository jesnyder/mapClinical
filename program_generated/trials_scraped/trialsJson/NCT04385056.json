            "While the pathophysiological changes that result in the symptoms of bradykinesia are poorly understood, an inflammatory component appears to be involved. Human umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have documented anti-inflammatory properties, which suggest these cells may be effective at treating Bradykinesia. It is understood that perinatal products are potent immune modulators. It is believed that the positive symptomatic effects are secondary to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in pathological inflammation. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia."

For the non-cancerconditions, if the condition has been stable for at least the past year and is judged by the site investigator not to interfere with the patient's participation in the study, the patient may be included.\nA history of alcohol or substance abuse within 1 year prior to screening and deemed to be clinically significant by the site investigator.\nAn employee or relative of an employee.\nSubjects who have donated plasma or platelets or had a significant loss of whole blood (480 ml or more) within 30 days.\nSubjects who have received blood or blood products within 30 days prior to screening.\nTreatment with any investigational drugs or device or participation in an investigational drug study within 60 days of screening.\nWomen of childbearing potential who are not using at least two forms of medically recognized contraception.\nFemale subjects who are pregnant, expecting to become pregnant, or lactating/nursing.\nAny subjects who have a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value.\nSubjects who have been treated with another research product 30 days prior to the screening assessment, or plant to participate in another clinical trial, while in this study. If more than 30 days have passed since participation in another clinical trial, the study staff must ensure that the subject has recovered from any adverse events associated with the research product used.\nSubjects who have a history of any other clinically significant disease or disorder that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, may place the subject at risk due to participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study."
