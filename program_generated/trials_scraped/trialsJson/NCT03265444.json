It shows signs similar to Parkinson's disease, however, it doesn't show improvement of symptoms by dopaminergic drugs and occurs at any age.\n\nThe clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, public phase 1 clinical trials.\n\nIf that subject's written consent to participate in this clinical trial will be conducted the required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol.\n\nThen, the register for each dose step. For the final 3 subjects in the inclusion / exclusion criteria and be administered a drug test.\n\nAnd check the adverse events for more than four hours after administration of the investigational drug, and will determine whether the expression of adverse drug reaction(ADR) by the visit after 1 days, 14 days and 28 days.\n\nExcept for dose administration, all subject are tested in the same schedule. As a result of evaluating severity of AE divided into subjective, objective in accordance with the CTCAE (Version 4.0) standards."
