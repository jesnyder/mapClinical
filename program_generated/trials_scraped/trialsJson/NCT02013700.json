      "DetailedDescription": [
            "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary insufficiency eventually resulting in death. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and non-productive cough, often accompanied by digital clubbing. Due to the insidious onset of symptoms, however, most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after significant fibrosis has occurred. Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia, \"dry\" inspiratory crackles on auscultation, and occasional digital clubbing (6). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) usually reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and six-minute walk distances. Diagnosis is established by the pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia (with sub epithelial fibroblastic foci) by open lung biopsy (7), and/or by high resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrating the characteristic findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular changes with fibrosis, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis (8, 9).\n\nThe prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is uniformly poor. The natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline interspersed with \"exacerbations\" or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal (5). There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and thus no standard of care. In cases of patients under the age of 60 with limited comorbid disease, lung transplant may be offered. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) receive empiric treatment, supportive care alone, and more recently, are offered enrollment in clinical trials.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by epithelial cell injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and eventual loss of function. Because mesenchymal stem cells are known to home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)."
