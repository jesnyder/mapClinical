Stem cell therapies are rapidly progressing fields and have shown immense promise in the treatment of lots of disease, including aging and premature ovarian failure. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intra vein injection of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells(hAMSCs) in women suffered from infertility caused by DOR. The hAMSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro and qualified by National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China. The serum of each patient was kept and sent for laboratory test before the transplantation. The biomarkers of hAMSCs were detected again before transplantation. The hAMSCs were transplanted via venous in the dorsum of hand. The outcomes of patients were examined during and after the injection. The patients are monitored for hormones, follicles stimulated with minimal stimulation, number of oocyte retrieval and embryos In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)."
