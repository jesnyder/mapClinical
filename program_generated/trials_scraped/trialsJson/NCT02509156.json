            "This phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial will evaluate the safety and feasibility of allo-MSCs administered by transendocardial injection in thirty-seven subjects with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). The first six subjects received allo-MSC therapy (open label) and were assessed for safety and feasibility of the study procedures. Following 1 month data review of each of the six subjects by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board; this was followed by a randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolling thirty-one subjects. These subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive allo-MSCs or placebo. All subjects underwent cardiac catheterization and study product administration using the NOGA Myostar catheter injection system. Subjects are being followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post study product injection. All endpoints are assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 180 \u00b130 days and 365 \u00b130 days, respectively, after the day of study product injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the safety evaluations and endpoint analysis, the Investigators will utilize an \"intention-to-treat\" study population. In addition, because this phase I study is the first cell therapy study in this population, at 12 months available standard-of-care medical records for cancer surveillance will be reviewed for cancer recurrence."
