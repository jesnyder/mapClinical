                              "The stages of wound healing:proceed in an organized way and follow four processes: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and maturation. Although the stages of wound healing are linear, wounds can progress backward or forward depending on internal and external patient conditions. The four stages of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase Hemostasis is the process of the wound being closed by clotting. Hemostasis starts when blood leaks out of the body. Inflammatory Phase Inflammation is the second stage of wound healing and begins right after the injury when the injured blood vessels leak transudate (made of water, salt, and protein) causing localized swelling. Proliferative Phase The proliferative phase of wound healing is when the wound is rebuilt with new tissue made up of collagen and extracellular matrix. Maturation Phase Also called the remodeling stage of wound healing, the maturation phase is when collagen is remodeled from type III to type I and the wound fully closes.\n\nFat Injection In Facial burn scar:The effects of the lipofilling can be seen starting from 3 weeks after the procedure, in terms of better scar color, pliability, thickness, relief, itching, pain, scar vascularization and pigmentation. Indeed, autologous fat grafting makes the skin softer, more flexible and extensible; besides, the color seems similar to the surrounding unharmed skin.\n\nPlatelet Rich Plasma In Facial burn scar: Impaired wound-healing and a long treatment course in severe burns as well as secondary complications originating from uncovered wounds motivate research to accelerate the wound-healing process and speed up re-epithelialization in burn patients."
