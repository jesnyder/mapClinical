SCAP were isolated from the impacted third molar teeth of the young adults. TAP, DAP and mTAP treatment (14-day medication and 28-day medication) were applied on SCAP and viability, proliferation and apoptosis of the cells were evaluated after four weeks. Osteocalcin (BGLAP), dentin sialo phosphoprotein (DSPP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) gene expression levels were also evaluated."
