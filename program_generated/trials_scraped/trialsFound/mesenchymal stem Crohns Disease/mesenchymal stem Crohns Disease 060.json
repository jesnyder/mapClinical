However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with permanent end ileostomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat people who have a peri-pouch fistula related to a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch."

Several studies have used autologous stem cells or adipose-derived stem cells to treat Crohn's disease and its associated complications, and have achieved good efficacy. Thus far, the use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat Crohn's disease has rarely been reported. In this study, UC-MSCs were used to treat patients with hormone-controlled Crohn's disease. We observed the disease control conditions, corticosteroid dosage changes, and treatment-related adverse reactions."

                              "The exact origin of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. The current hypothesis is that IBD is secondary to an abnormal intestinal immun response directed to all or part of the intestinal flora in genetically predisposed individuals. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow or adipose tissue origin to control intestinal inflammation in animal models. However, to date, there are no data regarding the functions of resident MSCs in the colon and small intestine of IBD patients. We hypothesize that dysfunction of resident intestinal MSCs contributes to the disruption of intestinal homeostasis in patients with IBD causing the development of intestinal inflammation. The aim of this research project is to identify, describe and characterize at the molecular and functional level MSCs of the colon and small intestine of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to compare them with a control population."

                              "Ano-perineal (or ano-rectal) fistulas are a frequent and major complication of Crohn's disease. Indeed, they indicate a greater severity of the disease. In addition, they have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Finally, these fistulas are difficult to cure, especially when they are complex. Indeed, medical treatment with anti-TNF drugs can only cure them in one third of cases. Various obturation treatments have been proposed in addition to medical treatment such as advancement flap, injection of biological glue, placement of a plug, intersphincter ligation of the fistulous path or laser but with still insufficient healing rates.\n\nThe injection of mesenchymal stem cells of adipose origin was first proposed for this indication in 2003. Since then, numerous studies have been published on the subject. Most importantly, an international multicenter randomized double-blind phase 3 controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of allogeneic stem cells over placebo with a therapeutic effect maintained at one year follow-up. The trial involved selected patients with Crohn's disease and one or more complex ano-perineal fistulas refractory to conventional treatments. This treatment has a high cost and its practical modalities are constraining (manufacturing, delivery, constrained time between the factory and the injection). However, this study is the first to have demonstrated in such a rigorous way the effectiveness of a local treatment on complex ano-perineal fistulas of Crohn's disease. These allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have therefore been granted marketing authorization in Europe and have been commercialized in several European countries including France during the summer of 2020 under the trade name ALOFISEL\u00ae. They are indicated for complex ano-perineal fistulas that have not responded to at least one conventional biological treatment, in the context of inactive or less active Crohn's disease.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to evaluate the rate of \"deep\" remission (i.e. clinical and radiological) at 12 months of follow-up in the first patients treated in France with ALOFISIEL\u00ae after its marketing. The evaluation is performed at 12 months because it seems that the result is consolidated after this period."

                              "Crohn's disease is an immunologically mediated inflammatory bowel disease with a reported incidence of 4.0-7.0, 7.1, and 1.34 per 100,000 persons in Europe, the U.S., and Korea, respectively. Uncontrolled chronic inflammation finally causes various complications in intestine such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, and anal fissures.\n\nThe incidence of perianal fistula was reported in 13%- 39% of patients with Crohn's disease. Medical treatment for Crohn's fistulae initially focused on surgical intervention accompanied by symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressants. The most serious problem after surgical intervention is the relatively high incidence of postoperative anal incontinence caused by sphincter injury during the procedure. Conversely, available pharmacological therapies for Crohn's fistulae based on biologic agents such as infliximab do not generally reach ideal goal of treatment (e.g., complete closure of the fistula). A high recurrence rate after treatment with infliximab has also been reported, even after long-term maintenance therapy, which suggests that infliximab monotherapy does not provide adequate healing.\n\nThe ACCENT II study demonstraded a complete fistula healing in 25% of patients. To reach a better clinical outcome, combination treatment with infliximab and surgical intervention is highly recommended for management of Crohn's fistulae. Nonetheless, even this strategy does not result in a satisfactory healing for many patients.\n\nThe ideal therapeutic goal of treatment is not only complete closure of the fistula without recurrence but also preservation of anal sphincter function. Unfortunately, currently available medical or surgical treatment is not likely to offer a cure for perianal fistulae and, as noted above, recurrence is frequently reported.\n\nTogether with active research in the field of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, autologous or allogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been studied for management of Crohn's disease and other disorders.\n\nOf particular relevance to this study, ASCs could be considered to be safe and efficacious therapeutic tools for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. Importantly, ASCs do not cause fecal incontinence after injection into the lesion site in Crohn's disease patients. A phase I dose-escalation clinical study with ASCs manufactured by Anterogen Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) demonstrated the safety and therapeutic potential of these cells for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. A phase II study demonstrated a good rate of cronh's related fistula closure using a ASCS injection.\n\nActually the best accepted treatment of Crohn related perianal fistula, is the surgical procedure in association whit medical therapy."

                              "In patients with Crohn's disease, anal fistulas are usually treated in three stages: 1) close examination of the fistula and drainage with a seton, 2) pharmacological treatment of the inflammatory component, and 3) closure of the fistulous tract by a sphincter-sparing technique. Setons are used to ensure the permeability of the fistulous tract, to decrease the rate of re-intervention due to the formation of new abscesses or tracts. A seton is a small, often elastic, thread used for drainage. It is inserted into the fistulous tract, passing from the external orifice of the fistula (close to the anus or, in some cases, the vaginal) through the fistula and exiting via the anal orifice.\n\nSeton use seems to minimize colonization of the mucosa of the fistulous tract by the intestinal flora, leukocyte infiltration, and the spread of inflammation within the fistulous tract. Most clinical practice guidelines advocate the use of a seton, but the level of evidence for the efficacy of this approach remains low (D, EL5). Indeed, only a few open studies have reported seton use to be potentially beneficial. In the retrospective study of 32 patients by Regueiro et al., a surgery group with seton insertion before treatment with infliximab was compared with a group on infliximab, without a seton, from the outset. Response rates were better in the group of patients with a seton, with a lower rate of recurrence and a longer time to recurrence than for the seton-less group. Another retrospective study by Schwartz et al. compared two groups - seton (n = 326) and no seton (n = 1519) - in patient with at least six months of biotherapy in three states of the USA. There were more hospitalizations and higher costs generated by greater use of the healthcare system in the group treated without a seton than in those with a seton.\n\nThe systematic use of setons in the context of Crohn's disease was inspired by the management of cryptoglandular fistula. However, the protective value of setons in this context remains far from clear, due to a lack of studies providing high-level evidence. Furthermore, the impact of seton use on patient quality of life has been little evaluated.\n\nInvestigators aim to determine whether the insertion of one or more setons in anal fistulas in Crohn's disease patients significantly alters patient quality of life. Investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial comparing two strategies: drainage surgery with and without seton use."

Twenty adult patients (age 18 years or older) with refractory, complicated perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore\u00ae Bio-A\u00ae fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient."
