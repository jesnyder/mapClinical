                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is notoriously difficult to cure with 37% of patients experiencing refractory disease. As a result, patients cycle through numerous immunosuppressive medications that can have significant side effects, and >90% undergo multiple surgical interventions putting them at risk of incontinence.\n\nThe specific rationale for MSCs in perianal Crohn's fistulas is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; 2) several studies reporting the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of perianal Crohn's fistula; 3) existence of safe manufacturing methods for isolation and expansion of MSCs.\n\nThis study will enroll 20 participants that have Crohn's disease with medically and surgically refractory perianal fistulizing disease. Participants enrolled will be those that meet particular criteria for participation in the clinical trial.\n\nEnrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved, participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and again three months after this as above, and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months."

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.\n\nThis study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.\n\nPatients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months post initial injection."

The proportion of patients with clinical and endoscopic response or remission will be used as the primary evaluation for follow-up. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was used to assess the severity of CD disease, with CDAI <150 considered to be in clinical remission; a decrease in CDAI \u226570 was considered to be clinically effective, also referred to as clinical response. Endoscopic response was defined as at least 50% improvement in the simplified endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) from baseline, and endoscopic remission was defined as a SES-CD score \u22642."

                              "Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional outcomes and quality of life. While less than 30% of patients experience short-term postoperative morbidity following IPAA, up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations. Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.\n\nPelvic sepsis following original IPAA has been reported in 5% to 25% of patients, and is the leading cause of pouch failure due to the development of pelvic fibrosis and decreased distensibility of the pouch, ultimately resulting in poor pouch function. One of the leading causes of pelvic sepsis and development of a pouch fistula is Crohn's Disease (CD) of the pouch. While the majority of pouches are constructed for UC, up to 25% of patients with an IPAA will end up having a change in diagnosis from UC to CD or development of de novo CD of the pouch.\n\nThe first report of successful healing of a Crohn's fistula with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was in 2003. Since them great enthusiasm has spurred several phase I phase II, and phase III trials designed to study the safety and efficacy of MSCs for perianal CD, all of which have reported encouraging results with regard to safety and efficacy. With over 300 patients now treated, there is a large body of evidence supporting the local delivery of MSCs to heal perianal Crohn's fistulas. Peri-pouch fistulas are similar to Crohn's perianal fistulas except that instead of the rectum containing the internal opening of the fistula, the internal opening is in the ileal pouch, constructed in place of the rectum.\n\nGiven the high safety profile and relative success in treating perianal Crohn's disease with mesenchymal stem cells, the investigators are using a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSC cell line to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients with ileal pouch fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. This trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals. The specific rationale for MSCs in IPAA is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory properties; 2) published experience of MSC in this condition and perianal Crohn's fistula demonstrating efficacy and safety; 3) existence of cGMP methods for their isolation and growth.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Patients who are refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Patients enrolled will be those that meet current indications."

Recently, a phase II multicenter randomized study was reported showing that expanded adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (atMSCs) in combination with fibrin glue was an effective and safe treatment for complex perianal fistula. However, dose escalation of allogeneic bone marrow (bm) MSCs for the local treatment of perianal fistulas has not been studied.\n\nIn this study, three escalating doses will be tested in a total of three cohorts. MSC implantation will be preceded by surgical localization, curettage of the fistulous tract and closure of the internal opening. Per cohort, patients will be randomized in a 5:2 fashion to receive either 10x10^6 (cohort 1), 30x10^6 (cohort 2) or 90x10^6 (cohort 3) bmMSCs or no cells (control group).\n\nThe primary endpoint will be assessed at week 12: i) the number of adverse and serious adverse events and ii) a reduction in the number of draining fistulas, which is defined as absence of discharge and absence of collections of \u22652 cm directly related to the treated fistulas tracts as measured by MRI."

Under 5% CO2. The conditioned media of MSCs (CM) were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 400\u00d7g to eliminate suspended cells, 30 min at 2500\u00d7g to remove debris and apoptotic bodies, and then ultracentrifuged for 120 min at 100000\u00d7g (Beckman, USA). The supernatants were collected and further ultracentrifuged for 120 min at 100000\u00d7g. Then the pellets containing exosomes were dissolved in PBS.\n\nTo verify The production of MSC- derived exosomes, vesicle protein content was measured by Bradford colorimetric assay (BCA) from 100 ml of CM. The size distribution of MSC- derived exosomes were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Moreover, to assess the expression of CD9, CD63 and CD81 were confirmed with flow cytometry and western blot., FITC mouse anti-CD63 (BD Pharmingen) and PE mouse anti-CD81 (BD Pharmingen) were used as reagents. Furthermore, the morphology and size of isolated exosomes were assessed using TEM by the previously set protocol in the previous study.\n\nThe procedure was undertaken in the operation room, and the patients were NPO 6 hours before the operation with intravenous sedation and oxygen supplementation with a mask. The patients, placed were placed in a lithotomy position. The external fistula opening was inspected, the tract was palpated, and using an Eisenhammer Retractor, the internal orifice was exposed seen. The lot was irrigated with saline several times using a small catheter to clear the pus and fecal material. After irrigation, a flexible fistula probe was inserted into the tract. Using the probe as a guide, we injected 5 mL of exosome solution into the tissue surrounding the lot. The injection depth was about 2about 2-3 mm of the soft tissue and sphincters of the anus. After the injection, the tract probe was extracted, the patients were under observation in the operation recovery rooming room recovery for 3 hours, and vital signs were monitored. The patients were then transferred to the surgery ward and were observed for 48 hours. The patients were again examined under sedation in the operation room for further evaluation six months after injection."

Subject with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease will be treated with Cx601, suspension of eASCs, at a dose of 120 million cells administered by intralesional injection. The treatment of complex perianal fistulas by local application of eASCs intends to improve significantly the local conditions with very few inconveniences (ambulatory procedure) and minimal risk of possible complications (anal incontinence). Therefore, this is a new therapeutic resource that is expected to be safe and efficacious as well as is expected to improve the quality of life of the patients in this highly debilitating and chronic condition. This treatment would prevent one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would diminish recurrence of the fistula disease and would reduce drastically the significant disorders provoked by the standard fistula surgery in the patients. Indeed, patients can be discharged according to the \"One Day Surgical\" procedures (major ambulatory surgery)."

All patients will be underwent a loose seton placement after antibiotics prophylaxis administration with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole to obtain a pelvis sepsis resolution at time 0.\n\nAt week 4 a surgical procedure will be performed. In general anesthesia a antibiotics prophylaxis will be administrated and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be collected by LIPOGEMS system to prepare ASCS.\n\nIn the infiltration step, adrenalin in a saline solution (2 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) is infiltrated using a 19-cm specially designed disposable blunt cannula.\n\nThe vasoconstriction together with the blunt point of the cannula avoids any accidental intravascular injection and facilitates the subsequent lipoaspiration. Three hundred to 500 ml are usually injected in the chosen area for fat harvesting (usually the lower abdomen), making the tissue really \"filled\" with the injecting solution. The aspiration step (lipoaspirate) is performed by a luer lock syringe connected to a disposable 19-cm blunt cannula (3 mm OD), with 5 oval holes (1 \u00b4 2 mm). A few strokes using a standard liposuction technique are enough to harvest 6-10 ml of fat tissue. Vacuum while aspirating can be obtained manually or by clamping the syringe plunger with a clamp instrument. Up to 1,000 ml can be harvested in less than 15 min, and 1-2 min are enough. The harvested lipoaspirate can be progressively put into the device using multiple 10-cc syringes.\n\nSubsequently, in lithotomy position, a seton will be removed and a fistula tract will be thoroughly curetted and irrigated. After a mucosal flap preparing round the internal opening, cells will be injected in the perianal adipose tissue.\n\nBetween 40 and 130 ml of lipoaspirate (ideally 100 ml) are processed at each time in the standard 225-ml device. To avoid cell damage, no air should be in the device during all procedural steps and the device should be prefilled with saline before beginning the processing. The aspirated fat should be always surrounded by a liquid environment: this is essential to obtain healthy smaller fat clusters instead of oil and adipose tissue debris. The first cluster reduction was obtained by pushing the aspirated fat from the syringe into the device and through the first size reduction filter while allowing the corresponding quantity of saline to exit towards the waste bag. The final Lipogems product is then collected into 10-ml syringes connected to the upper opening of the device. The final Lipogems product is now ready for the injection in the perianal fistula.\n\nAfter a SALVECOLL-E paste injection into the fistula tract the mucosal flap will may be closed with an absorbable interrupted sutures. A external opening will be sealed with Dermabond Mini.\n\nThe patients will receive a intravenous infusion of Infliximab (Remicade) at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight at weeks 8, 10, 14 and every 8 week for a total of nine doses.\n\nRationale for treatment The ASCS injection in the perianal adipose tissue in association with Infliximab therapy, would improve a crohn related perianal fistula healing.\n\nThis association could be reduce a recurrence and reintervention rate with an improvement of quality of life.\n\nTrial population Number of subjects to be studied Planned number of subjects to be screened: 10 Anticipated number of trial sites: 1\n\nWithdrawal criteria The subject may withdraw at will at any time. The patient may be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator for safety concerns. If the patient withdraws or is withdrawn at any time after receiving trial product, final safety information will be obtained.\n\nPatients who are deemed during surgery not suitable included in this protocol will be withdrawn from the study. In case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified in the CRF.\n\nA patient withdrawn from the study will be analyzed according to evaluability of Subjects for Analysis.\n\nMethods and assessments Visit procedures\n\nThe study comprises of the following visits:\n\nVisit 1: Diagnosis, baseline visit and first surgery procedure: Screening of patient, Baseline examination, Pre-surgery and surgery assessment, Informed consent.\nVisit 2: Treatment visit: Surgery\nVisit 3: Medical treatment: start Infliximab administration\nVisit 4, 5, 6, 7,8,9: Medical treatment follow-up\nVisit 10: end of study: last infliximab dose\n\nIn case of any premature discontinuation of the trial, the patient will, if possible, be called in for a last visit. Even if the patient is not able to attend, the End of Trial Form must be completed.\n\nThe Investigator must keep a subject screening log and a subject enrolment log. These can be combined in one document.\n\nSubjects enrolled in the trial will be provided with a documents stating that he/she is in a trial, contact address and telephone numbers.\n\nIn case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified in the CRF.\n\nAll patients will be classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification as described below. No restriction regarding to ASA status will be applied in this trial.\n\nPatient Compliance The investigator will reinforce compliance with the protocol by ensuring that only patients willing to follow the trial procedures are enrolled in the trial.\n\nDefinitions adverse events\n\nAdverse event (AE):\n\nAny untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.\n\nAn adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.\n\nNote: This includes events from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol.\n\nThe following should not be recorded as AEs:\n\nPre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent.\nPre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures. These should be recorded as medical history/concomitant illness.\n\nAn AE can also be a clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity which requires active management (i.e. discontinuation of trial product, more frequent follow-up or diagnostic investigation).\n\nThe following events will not be recorded as adverse events, as such discomforts are expected to be related to the surgical procedure:\n\nPost operative nausea/vomit\nPost operative sore throat due to intubation\nPost operative pain due to surgical intervention within 3 months from the operation.\n\nSerious adverse event (SAE):\n\nA SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:\n\nDeath\nA life-threatening* experience\nIn-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nA persistent or significant disability/incapacity\n\nImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.\n\nThe term \"life-threatening\" in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.\n\nNon-serious adverse event:\n\nA non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of a serious AE.\n\nSeverity assessment definitions:\n\nMild - No or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities.\nModerate - Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities.\nSevere - Considerable interference with the subject's daily activities, unacceptable.\n\nRelationship to trial product assessment definitions:\n\nProbable: good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship\nPossible: a causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed\nUnlikely: the event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product\n\nOutcome categories and definitions:\n\nRecovered - Fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed consent.\nRecovering - The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial.\nRecovered with sequelae - As a result of the AE the subject suffered persistent and significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyzed). Any AE recovered with sequelae should be rated as an SAE.\nNot recovered.\nFatal.\nUnknown - This term should only be used in cases where the subject i"

Similar results have been obtained in small series of patients with fistulas of cryptoglandular origin and also in rectourethral and rectovaginal fistulas of other etiologies. Unfortunately, this treatment is time consuming and extremely expensive.\n\nFresh adipose tissue is an alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with regenerative capabilities, immunomodulatory angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. The injection of fresh adipose tissue, obtained by liposuction from the same patient, is currently a therapeutic alternative used in regenerative medicine, plastic and orthopedic surgery indications, as well in other fields. Beneficial effects of fresh adipose tissue on anus fistulas and fecal incontinence have also been reported.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the injection of autologous, microfragmented and minimally manipulated adipose tissue, associated with a surgical technique that obtains by itself up to 70% cure in order to add the benefits of surgery with those in regenerative medicine hoping that the beneficial effects of MSC will aid in the healing and repair process.\n\nA prospective study is proposed in 12 patients with non-Crohn's-related complex anals fistulas. Whenever possible, the endorectal advancement flap technique will be applied; in blind fistulas and special cases, in which the flap is not indicated, alternative techniques will be used. In all cases, autologous, micro-fragmented and minimally manipulated adipose tissue, obtained with a standardized procedure, previously validated and authorized, will be injected. This procedure uses the \"Lipogems \u00ae\" device (Lipogems International SpA, Milan, Italy), with which a well-characterized adipose tissue is obtained with the maximum safety guarantees."

Fifteen adult patients with refractory, rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. If the participant is not currently diverted, then participants will undergo a laparoscopic diversion with a loop ileostomy. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The participants will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.\n\nParticipants will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified participants will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessed. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug. Participants will return on: Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104."

                              "Crohn's disease is mysterious chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It usually happen in the young age and last forever. It is not yet clearly known the origin of crohn's disease. However, crohn's disease therapy is getting developed by using immunosuppressant and TNF-alpha inhibitor. Nonetheless, some patients still don't react to TNF-alpha inhibitor which is most effective treatment. Also, Even though some other patients reacted to the treatment at first, the effect of treatment decreases over time. Plus, long-term use of TNF-alpha inhibitor can lead to complication of infection and occurrence of malignant tumor like lymphoma. Recently, treatment of intractable crohn's disease is attempted by using stem cell. Especially, Mesenchymal stem cell is well-known for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory ability and cell differentiation ability to various lineage cell as non hematopoietic stromal cell.\n\nWhen the body get infected by the pathogens, innate immune response operate as the primary defence mechanism. at this time, there are some receptors reacting first such as TLR(toll-like receptor) and NLR(nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) which is located in the cytoplasm of a cell. It is reported that the activities of TLR which is expressed by Mesenchymal stem cells play an important roles about immunomodulatory ability of Mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells( hUCB-USCs) manifest TLR and NLR of Mesenchymal Stem cells at the same time. when those receptors become activation, it maximize ability of immunomodulatory. Therefore, hUCB-USCs can be utilized to cure intractable autoimmune disease like Crohn's disease. Further, It has huge possibility as cell therapy products for autoimmune disease."

The drug product is a mesenchymal cell substrate system comprised of autologous mesenchymal cells incubated with a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable substrate. The drug substance is expanded, pure mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which are known to modulate local inflammation and orchestrate tissue healing. By incubating cells with a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable substrate designed for anal fistula geometry, cells are locally delivered into the fistula tract to promote healing."
