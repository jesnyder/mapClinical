                              "Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant has become first choice of treatment for many malignant and non malignant haematological disorders. Although great progress has been made to prevent and minimize transplant-associated complications, yet graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains a significant complication affecting these the outcome in these patients. It is a severe inflammatory condition that arises when recipient tissues are attacked by immune mediated donor T cells during transplantation. Acute GVHD predominately affects the skin, upper and lower GI tract, liver and occasionally the eye and oral mucosa, whereas chronic GVHD resembles more with autoimmune disorders in its clinical symptoms. These symptoms can be organ-specific or generalized throughout body.\n\nThe pathophysiology of GVHD shows that it has different phases. In first phase i.e., afferent phase, damage to host tissue occurs. In second phase i.e., Induction and expansion phase, donor T cells are triggered and activated by recipient and donor APC as well as the inflammatory cytokines. Activated T cells produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 (or Th1 response). Allogeneic immune response is amplified by IL-2, which activates more T cells and natural killer cell responses, triggering macrophages to release TNF-\u03b1 and further inflammation damages skin and gut. The third phase i.e., effector phase, is characterized by cytotoxic damage against host cells by activated donor T-cell-mediated through Fas-Fas ligand interaction, perforin-granzyme and TNF-\u03b1. The latter has a central role in the pathophysiology, stimulating cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1). This dysregulation leads to the clinical manifestations of acute GVHD.\n\nThe cells involved in GVHD pathophysiology include CD4+ T cells; for maintaining the expansion of CD8+ T cells that mediate GVHD, APCs; these have role in the initiation phase of acute GVHD as described in murine models and Natural killer (NK) cells; contribute to tissue damage in the effector phase by releasing inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. However, natural killer cells mediate cell death by two important pathways: Fas-Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis and perforin-granzyme-B-mediated cytolysis.\n\nHLA differences between donor and recipient are the major predictor of GVHD. Other affecting factors include age, gender mismatch between donor and recipient, minor histocomapatability antigen expression difference(mHA) in otherwise identical HSCT, donor age, source and dose of stem cells (PBSCT greater risk than BM), intensity of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nSteroids are the first line therapy for acute GVHD patients and are standard treatment for grade II-IV acute GVHD. Adverse effects of glucocorticoids include hypertension hyperglycemia and psychosis, immunosuppression, infections, myopathy, osteoporosis and avascular necrosis of bone, cataracts and fat re-distribution etc. If acute GVHD is not improved after 5-7 days treatment with steroids then it is considered as steroid-refractory. Various agents that are being investigated from last two decades as second line therapy include low-dose MTX, MMF, extracorporeal photopheresis, IL-2R targeting, antibody therapy against CD3, CD7, CD25, CD52, CD147, IL-2R, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 (i.e., basiliximab, daclizumab, denileukin, diftitox and alemtuzumab), horse ATG, etanercept, infliximab, and sirolimus and recently infusions of mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as self-renewing, multipotent progenitor cells with potential to differentiate into other cell types of mesodermal origin, such as adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy developed the minimal criteria for definition of MSCs which is as follows: first, adherence to plastic; Second, positivity for the cell-surface molecules CD105, CD73, and CD90 and negativity for CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR; and third, the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts under standard in vitro differentiation conditions. Since Le Blanc and colleagues first reported successful treatment of a patient with severe acute GVHD using third-party haploidentical MSCs in 2004, many clinical trials worldwide have described the benefits of MSC therapy in GVHD.\n\nThe proposed project is a phase I/II clinical trial of single group, open label, interventional study design. The objective is to observe the safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of ex-vivo expanded bone marrow mesenchymal cells from a third party donor for treating refractory GVHD. The study will also document the type and frequency of any adverse event or side effects, if discovered."

                              "This study prospective single center study . A total of 10 patients are selected to be treated with dental implants for their bilaterally missing edentulous condition, which can be supported by either removable or fixed rehabilitation. The edentulous space can either be in maxilla or mandible. The study is performed at the Department of Implantology (Sri Sai College Of Dental Surgery and Research Center, Vikarabad, India). The study is approved by institutional ethics committee (IEC).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nNobel Biocare Replace Select Dental Implants of size 4.3x10 mm. Healing abutments and implant abutments. 20 Numbers.\nNobel Biocare surgical kit\nNobel Biocare physio dispenser\nTranschymal Dental pulp derived Allogenic mesenchymal cells.\nOstell ISQ device along with a Smart peg.\nA Centrifuge.\nSterile centrifuge tubes,\nSterile pipettes\nBone roungers\nIOPA and KKD Radiographic system\nCold saline\nSuture material and suture needles\n70% isopropanol\nChiller and a Thermo cool box to carry dry ice\nSterile cotton and gauze\nMouth mirror\nDental examination Probe\nNeedle holder\nArtery Forceps and scissors.\nSurgical gown,patient drape, Mouth mask, head cap and surgical gloves\nHigh power suction and suction tips.\nBetadine and chlorhexidine mouthwash.\nBP blade handle and BP blade no 11,12 and 15\nCanon DSLR camera\nPatient models and surgical guide\nInformed and written consent forms.\nCase history records\nPhotography and videography waiver consent form\nEthical Clearance Certificate\nCBCT\nVital parameters data sheet\nDiagnostic reports of CBP, RBS, CT, BT and Hg%\nAntibiotic and anti-allergic prophylaxis.\nA local anesthetic solution containing 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000-epinephrine and 2ml disposable syringe.\nStatistical analysis software IBM SPSS version 19.\n\nMETHODS\n\nClinical Procedure\n\nPre-operative planning is based on clinical and radiographic examination. After thoroughly recording the case history. The following investigations will be done prior to implant placement surgery: CBCT, CBP, CT, BT, Hg%, RBS, Vital signs and other relevant investigations. If all the parameters fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient's impressions are made and study models poured. Intraoral and extraoral photographs are taken. The surgical guide is constructed on the diagnostic models.Stem cells are carried from stem cell bank to the Department of Implantology in a cryovial, safely placed in the special device, which contains dry ice, to maintain the viability of stem cells.\n\nSurgical Procedure\n\nOn the day of surgery, the dental operatory is thoroughly fumigated and all the infection control protocols are followed.The participants will be receiving oral and written information about the study and shall be providing the informed consent along with photography and videography waiver consent. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (amoxicillin 1gm) and antihistamine prophylaxis (20mg cetirizine) orally 1 hour before surgery should be given to the patient. The universal precautions protocol is followed to protect yourself, the patients and the dental assistant.The patient is asked to rinse the Oral cavity with chlorhexidine gluconate solution (0.2%) for 1 minute before surgery.\n\nIMPLANT PLACEMENT ON THE CONTROL SIDE\n\nTo standardized the protocol the patient's right side is selected as the control side and left side as the test side. The surgical procedure is carried out under local anesthesia containing 2% epinephrine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The surgical guide is placed on the teeth and is used to mark the position of the implant with round drill till it hits the bone. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised with mid crestal incision and intrasulcular incision extending to one tooth mesially and other teeth distally. After full thickness flap elevation, the osteotomy sites are prepared using the drilling sequence instructed by the manufacturer.The dental implants Nobel Biocare Replace select (4.3 *10mm size) 4.3mm diameter and 10mm length is selected and placed in the osteotomy site with IF of 40 Ncm.Before approximation of the flap, the primary stability of the implant is recorded with the ostell device, which has a transducer attached to the device and a magnetic attachment smart peg is attached to the implant with a plastic peg holder each implant is measured twice from two different angles,around 90 degrees and parallel to the crestal line.The two measurements buccolingually and mesiodistally are recorded and an average of both the values are taken.The measurements values are then transferred into implant stability quotient (ISQ) units, which are given on a scale of 1- 100, with 100 being the highest degree of stability and it works on the principle of resonance frequency analysis (RFA).The smart peg is removed and Healing abutments are placed over the dental implants. The flap is sutured monofilament sutures 4-0. IOPAR are taken with KKD Radiograph system, which standardizes the distance between the collimator and the IOPAR.\n\nIMPLANT PLACEMENT ON THE TEST SIDE\n\nTo standardized the protocol the patient's left side is chosen as the test side.The surgical procedure is carried out under local anesthesia containing 2% epinephrine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The surgical guide is placed on the teeth and is used to mark the position of the implant with round drill till it hits the bone. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised with mid crestal incision and intrasulcular incision extending to one tooth mesially and another tooth distally. After full thickness flap elevation, the osteotomy sites are prepared using the drilling sequence instructed by the manufacturer. the stem cells are centrifuged in a sterile environment as per the instructions are given by the stem cell bank.(Thawing protocol )Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are primary cells which can be successfully used for infusion purpose.The following is the recommended protocol for thawing and infusion of these cells:Remove the Cryovial of stem cells from dry ice,defrost the vial containing stem cells by placing in between both the palms with constant, moderate agitation, until ice in the ampule is no longer visible,immediately disinfect the vial with 70% isopropanol.Working under laminar flow hood, open the vial and transfer the contents to a sterile 15ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3500 RPM for 5 minutes. Decant the supernatant and to the pellet add 1 ml of saline.Mix properly and the cells are ready for infusion at the osteotomy site. Remove the contents in a sterile dappen dish and before infusion of stem cells at the osteotomy site the implant is dipped in the solution for 3 minutes so that the stem cells adhere to the titanium implant surface. The same dental surgeon performs all the cases. The dental implants Nobel Biocare Replace select (4.3 *10mm size) 4.3mm diameter and 10mm length is selected and placed in the osteotomy site with IF of 40 Ncm11.Before approximation of the flap, the primary stability of the implant is recorded with the ostell device, which has a transducer attached to the device and a magnetic attachment smart peg is attached to the implant with a plastic peg holder each implant is measured twice from two different angles,around 90 degrees and parallel to the crestal line.The two measurements buccolingually and mesiodistally are recorded and an average of both the values are taken.The measurements values are then transferred into implant stability quotient (ISQ) units, which are given on a scale of 1- 100, with 100 being the highest degree of stability and it works on the principle of resonance frequency analysis (RFA).The smart peg is removed and Healing abutments are placed over the dental implants. The flap is sutured monofilament sutures 4-0.IOPAR are taken with KKD radiograph system, which standardizes the distance between the collimator and the IOPAR.\n\nPOST SURGICAL TREATMENT\n\nThe patient is advised to take soft diet for one week and not to spit and rinse for the next 24 hours. Antibiotics, Antihistamines, and NSAIDs must be continued for 3 days. Postoperative edema if any must be controlled with corticosteroids. The sutures are removed one week postoperatively.\n\nRecall visits\n\nWeekly recall of the patient for 12 weeks for evaluation and recording of implant stability measurements with Ostell ISQ device. Patient safety measures are evaluated on every visit like unusual pain, swelling, allergic reaction, inflammation, outgrowth, vital signs, blood assay or any unspecific reactions should be noted down. The emergency contact number is provided to the patient to report any abnormal incidence immediately. The prosthetic part of the treatment is to be carried out after 3 months either with removable or fixed rehabilitation.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics will be computed to summarize the data for its central tendency and dispersion. Two sample t-test will be applied to see the mean change in the outcome variable between experimental and control groups. Repeated measures of ANOVA are being applied to see the time changes between experimental and control groups. Where ever data is not following uniformity, either transforming the data or nonparametric statistical technique will be applied. The analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Version 19.0."

                              "Introduction: The most important cause of death in patients with cirrhosis is the development of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF), a syndrome recently redefined with high mortality. The only effective treatment for ACLF is liver transplantation. However, available organs are limited. Other treatments, such as artificial liver support systems, do not improve survival. ACLF is characterized by increased systemic inflammatory state together with impaired liver regeneration what leads to multiorgan failure. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is an attractive strategy for ACLF owing to the immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of these cells. Aim: To investigate the effects of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs transplantation on liver and other organ functions and systemic inflammation in patients with ACLF. Altruist bone marrow donors will be the source of MSCs. Design and methodology: randomized, double-blind phase I placebo-controlled trial aimed at comparing placebo (solution without cells) and MSCs (4 doses of 2 x 106/kg administered on days 1, 4, 11 and 18). Thirty patients, 15 per group will be included. ACLF will be defined by the CLIF SOFA score and patients stratified according to severity. Outcomes evaluated will be: 1) Organ function (CLIF SOFA and CLIF-C ACLF score); 2) Liver (Child-Pugh and MELD scores,serum bile acids, ammonia and lactate levels), circulatory (systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics, renin, noradrenalin) and endothelial function (nitric oxide, von Willebrand factor); 3 Inflammatory response (serum cytokine panel and transcriptomic analysis of monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells from peripheral blood); 4) Survival at 28 days, 3 and 12 months; and 5) Safety. Expected results: Therapy with MSCs could have beneficial effects on the evolution of patients with ACLF (modulation of inflammatory response and improvement of liver and extra-hepatic organ function) what could translate into an improvement on short-term survival."

If a patient or the treating clinician decides that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians.

During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive treatment as usual per their clinician's choice. Patients will remain on stable psychiatric medications during this period. If patients need to change medications, they will be removed from the study protocol."

                              "Stroke remains a major global healthcare problem. Recent data compiled by the American Heart Association (AHA) for 2008 show that the annual incidence of new or recurrent stroke in the United States is about 780,000, with approximately 600,000 of these strokes being first attacks. Among adults age 20 and older, the estimated prevalence of stroke in 2005 was 5.8 million in the United States, resulting in >150,000 deaths annually, with 4.8 million stroke survivors alive today. Stroke ranks as the country's third leading cause of death, behind only cancer and heart disease. The only approved treatments of acute ischemic stroke involve restoring blood flow to the affected region by using thrombolytics or mechanical devices that physically remove clots. However, the use of thrombolytics is limited due to the therapeutic window of < 3-6 hours post onset of stroke symptoms such that only a small fraction of stroke patients receive this therapy. Following the completion of a stroke, there is little therapy to offer patients to promote recovery other than physical, occupational, and speech therapy.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment. In addition to their ability to differentiate into multiple different cell types that would be contributory to the recovery and repair of the brain by replacing destroyed cells, mesenchymal stem cells also secrete angiogenins, cytokines and trophic factors that can support and stimulate multiple other cell types. The cascade of cellular events following the release of these cytokines and trophic factors would also potentially lead to beneficial effects by restoring blood supply, by rescuing cells at risk, and by stimulating the remaining cell populations to repair and propagate new cells and synaptic connections."

                              "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths. It is estimated that one in three or approximately 80 million American adults have one or more types of CVD, with approximately 38.1 million of those estimated to be 60 years of age or older. The data was extrapolated to the United States population in 2006 from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 data.\n\nMortality data show CVD as the underlying cause of death (including congenital cardiovascular defects) accounting for 35.3% (864,480) of all 2,448,017 deaths in 2005, or one of every 2.8 deaths in the United States. CVD total deaths (1,372,000 deaths in 2005) accounted for about 56% of all deaths in 2005. Nearly 2,400 Americans die of CVD each day, an average of one death every 30 seconds. CVD claims about as many lives each year as cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes mellitus combined (NCHS).\n\nStem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion. Dib et. al., demonstrated the survival, feasibility, and safety of autologous myoblast transplantation and suggests that stem cell transplantation offers a potential therapeutic treatment for end-stage heart disease.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment. Allogenic mesenchymal bone marrow cells can be isolated from bone marrow. They are the primary cells used in tissue engineering expressing multiple cell types. Tissue engineering is very promising, generating hope that reconstruction of organs and repair diseased and damaged tissue may be possible.\n\nThere are two major types of aMBMC, hematopoetic (mononuclear) and stromal MSCs. Stromal MBMC, the cell type to be used in this study, proved to be more effective in reestablishing profusion as they secreted additional cytokine factors associated with angiogenesis. The multilineage potential of stromal MSCs, their ability to elude detection by the host immune system and even down regulate T-cell response allows for allogeneic multiple stem cell therapeutic use.\n\nOcclusion of the left main or left anterior descending artery causes irreversible injury to the cardiomyocytes in as little as 20 minutes. The goal of therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy is to limit damage in the following areas:\n\nLimit infarct size\nPrevent reperfusion injury\nPrevent excessive fibrosis\nReestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.\nReestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis\nPreserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration)\nPrevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction, preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity.\n\nAn IV study administering adult allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to 53 subjects following AMI showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction. The availability of \"off the shelf\" allogeneic stem cells will allow for an easily adjustable dose (getting enough cells in the autologous model is often a problem) for each individual subject. The ease of IV administration will make stem cell therapy more cost effective and safer to administer than the current catheter models. This study protocol will expand on the safety and efficacy of aMBMC in subjects suffering from ischemic cardiomyopathy."

The MSCs manufactured for this study are a subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors. These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can differentiate into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to contributing directly to repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate the body's own cells to regenerate.\n\nThough an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a similar effect in skin rejuvenation.\n\nIn the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant cutaneous photodamage."

After a two to six week screening period, subjects will have a Baseline visit (Days 1-2) where they will undergo a single intravenous infusion of up to 5 x 10EE6 allogeneic hMSCs/kg of body weight. Infusions will be performed in the Dahms Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Subjects will be monitored for any infusion related toxicities for 24 hours after the infusion. Subsequent study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, Months 3 and 6 and telephone calls will occur on Days 4 (or 5), 21, 56 and Month 12. Subject safety and tolerability of a single dose of hMSCs will be evaluated at study visits by review of subject diaries, interval history, pulmonary exacerbations, physical examination, spirometry, and analysis of safety laboratories. Special attention will be placed upon detecting pulmonary exacerbations because anti-inflammatory therapies theoretically could suppress the immune system to the point where it leads to increased infectious complications, although MSC therapeutics are proposed to be antimicrobial. In addition to evaluating safety, this study will also explore efficacy end-points for future clinical trials of MSCs in CF including inflammatory biomarkers from blood and sputum. Serum markers (calprotectin, MPO, GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL8, IL-17, and TNF-a) and sputum markers (white cell counts and differentials, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, GM-CSF, MIP- 3a, TNF-a, and active proteases including neutrophil elastase, a1-anti-trypsin, and MMP-9) will be determined at Baseline and on Days 7 and 28 for with-in subject comparison. All subject samples will be archived for future projects. Finally, a diagnostic bone marrow exam will be performed on subjects with CF who consent to undergo this optional procedure. Bone marrow samples will be banked and used for future translational studies."

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis are needed.\n\nThis study will assess the effectiveness of the allogeneic mesenchymal cell from umbilical cord. Patients who have received mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSC) are expected to have positive effects such as reduced pain sensation in the back assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), improvement in the range of motion (ROM), improving the quality of osteoporosis patients's bone proven by the results of Bone Mass Density (BMD) and improvement in patients' quality of life."

                              "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths.\n\nStem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction.\n\nThe hMSCs are able to:\n\nPrevent reperfusion injury;\nPrevent excessive fibrosis;\nReestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.\nReestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis;\nPreserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration);\nPrevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis;\nLimit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, long-term allograft survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade.\n\nA promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use without the delay required for expansion.\n\nAlthough it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged, they could possibly elicit an anti-donor immune response, which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and impact the allograft survival on the long term. These safety issues should be studied before further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting.\n\nMSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at increased risk for developing immune mediated injury. In addition, a large amount of the kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis which so importantly affects long term survival. MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk."

                              "Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional outcomes and quality of life. While less than 30% of patients experience short-term postoperative morbidity following IPAA, up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations. Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.\n\nPelvic sepsis following original IPAA has been reported in 5% to 25% of patients, and is the leading cause of pouch failure due to the development of pelvic fibrosis and decreased distensibility of the pouch, ultimately resulting in poor pouch function. One of the leading causes of pelvic sepsis and development of a pouch fistula is Crohn's Disease (CD) of the pouch. While the majority of pouches are constructed for UC, up to 25% of patients with an IPAA will end up having a change in diagnosis from UC to CD or development of de novo CD of the pouch.\n\nThe first report of successful healing of a Crohn's fistula with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was in 2003. Since them great enthusiasm has spurred several phase I phase II, and phase III trials designed to study the safety and efficacy of MSCs for perianal CD, all of which have reported encouraging results with regard to safety and efficacy. With over 300 patients now treated, there is a large body of evidence supporting the local delivery of MSCs to heal perianal Crohn's fistulas. Peri-pouch fistulas are similar to Crohn's perianal fistulas except that instead of the rectum containing the internal opening of the fistula, the internal opening is in the ileal pouch, constructed in place of the rectum.\n\nGiven the high safety profile and relative success in treating perianal Crohn's disease with mesenchymal stem cells, the investigators are using a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSC cell line to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients with ileal pouch fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. This trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals. The specific rationale for MSCs in IPAA is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory properties; 2) published experience of MSC in this condition and perianal Crohn's fistula demonstrating efficacy and safety; 3) existence of cGMP methods for their isolation and growth.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Patients who are refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Patients enrolled will be those that meet current indications."

                              "Background: Fecal incontinence is a distressing condition with recurrent uncontrolled passage of fecal material. Although fecal incontinence is developed by multifactorial causes, treatments were limited in medical or surgical methods. According to the recent studies of stem cell regeneration, it is reported that human adipose-derived stem cells have plentiful capacity in muscle regeneration, which had the efficacy to treat Crohn's fistulas. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the capability of muscle regeneration of allogenic-adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ALLO-ASC) can be used to treat degenerated anal sphincter, which leads to fecal incontinence.\nPurpose:The investigators aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy in the treatment of fecal incontinence by injection of ALLO-ASC into the anal sphincter.\n\nMethod\n\nSafety test of allogenic ASCs injection In the first year, the investigators will investigate the safety of ALLO-ASC injection by a dose escalation study. Patients are sequentially enrolled into three groups, which are composed of three patients each. They are treated with an injection of ALLO-ASC to the anal sphincter for 3x107 cells/ml (group 1), 6x107 cells/ml (group 2), 9x107 cells/ml (group 3), respectively. After receiving the ALLO-ASC injection, patients will receive a physical examination, a serologic and immunologic response test (CD4/CD8) with an assessment of the Wexner score, patient satisfaction survey, WHO toxicity scale, adverse events, anorectal manometry and endorectal ultrasound at 1, 4, 8 weeks, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months in the outpatient clinic. The response of ALLO-ASC injection is assessed at 8 weeks after an injection and the most effective dose is determined among the groups.\nEfficacy test of allogenic ASCs injection In the second year, the investigators will assess the efficacy of the ALLO-ASC injection comparing the ALLO-ASC injection group and the placebo group (0.9% normal saline injection) by a randomized, open-label, single-blind design. Each group is composed of six patients. Both the clinical assessment and follow-up period are identical with the first-year protocol."

Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nInvestigators will culture donated bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in a unique automated system, and infuse the cells in a fresh, replicating stage of growth.

CP is an umbrella term and represents a group of conditions (not a single disorder) , has a broad range of expression with a static condition originally within the developing central nervous system . CP Is a disturbance of movement and or posture . At the present time there is no standard medical or surgical treatment for it .Stem cell therapy is a new and promising treatment .\n\n150 cases of diparetic and quadiparetic spastic CP between 4-14 years old selected among the patients referred to the pediatric neurology outpatient department of Children's Medical Center Hospital (CMC) affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences and had our inclusion criteria. HLA analysis were done for these patients and 36 cases of class 6 matched cases enrolled to the hematopoietic stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MNC) because of necessity of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching in this type of cells and 72 cases among the remaining patients randomly divided to Mesenchymal stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MSC) and control group . Therefore 108 cases enrolled in 3 divided group of 36 patients .\n\nPatients admitted to CMC hospital and intrathecal injection were done with sedation . Only one injection of stem cell was done for each patient . In the control group after insertion of the needle into the skin with an appearance of lumbar puncture simulation , no injection were done without the awareness of the patients or their parents. All of the patients admitted for one day and discharged the next day . As we wrote in the consent form for ethical consideration we are committed to perform stem cell injection for control participants free of charge after 12 months of the follow up . All of the participants will be referred for neurorehabilitation with a identical protocol .Both parents and clinical evaluators are not aware of the 3 divided groups and our study is double blind .Outcome measures will be evaluated 1, 3, 6. and 12 months after intervention .\n\nStandard brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) were done before injection as baseline and will be repeated after 12 months of clinical follow up . This study designed for the evaluation of therapeutic effects of intrathecal MNC and MSC derived from allogenic umbilical cord in change and probable improvement of developmental functions of spastic CP patients between 4-14 years old in comparison with control group .Different scoring systems such as Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) , Gross Motor Function Measure Score (GMFM66) , Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) , Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) , CP QOL , Life Habits Questionnaire and Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity were done at baseline and then will be repeated in follow ups until 12 months of final evaluation .\n\nAcute side effects and probable long term side effects will be reported and noted on our preformed questioners ."

                              "Research Methods Study Design This study is an experimental one arm study post test only. Estimated Study Time Research estimated time would be 24 months, from May 2014 to May 2016. Sample Gaining Procedure This research is a pilot study. Samples are obtained consecutively from all source population that meet the criteria. The number of samples from each mesenchymal stem cell ( adipose, bone marrow and umbilical cord) source are three. Each samples derived from three different donors that met the inclusion criteria. For the implanation, the subjects are five from each intervention. Yet regarding the limited funding source and time, we will recruit one subject for each kind of MSC.\n\nSubject Criteria Inclusion criteria for MSC donor\n\nBone marrow donor :\n\nMale/female aged 19-30 year without any comorbiditites (Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and any other autoimmune disease), HIV test Hepatitis B test and Hepatitis C test are negaitve, no fungal and bacterial contamination in the bone marrow. Subjects are willing to be aspiratied in the iliac crest in order to get the bone marrow.\n\nAdipose donor :\n\nAdipose tissue are gained from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure. Samples of adipose are free from HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nUmbilical cord donor :\n\nUmbilical cord are form elective seccio caecaria from a fullterm mother without any complications and free from HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and no fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nRecipient inclusion criteria Critical bone defect patients aged 6-55 who are willing to undergo surgical intervention.\n\nRecipient exclusion criteria Patients with pathological fracture caused by malignancy, immunocompromised ( HIV AIDS, Diabetes mellitus, active Hepatitis), in a immunosuppresant therapy ( chemotherapy or steroids).\n\nDrop out criteria Patients are ruled out from this study if he/she stated to do so in the time this research are held or she/he undergoes any other threatment that are not related to this study. Patient who does not show any clinical improvement in three consecutive months is categorized as failed to threat. All drop out and failed to threat patient could get other threatment.\n\nInformed Consent All subjects must fill and sign in the informed consent letters.\n\nResearch Protocol Mesenchymal stem cell taking method Bone Marrow taking Patient is lying down in supine position, anesthetized locally. Aseptic and antiseptic are done in the illiac crest location. Aspiration needle is inserted 450 to horizon in illiac crest. Hub is released and a 10 cc syringe that contain heparin is connected to te needle. We aspirated about 50 cc bone marrow from each subject.\n\nUmbilical cord taking Right after the delivering the baby, the umbilical cord are cut and kept in a sterile bowl containing 0.9% NaCl in 40 until the sample is proceed.\n\nAdipose taking Adipose tissue are derived from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure. It is kept in a sterile bowl containing NaCL 0.9% in 40 C. Processing of the sample is done within 8 hours after sample are taken.\n\nCryopreservation and re activation. All the samples are taken to culture laboratory in integrated service of stem cell medical technology Cipto mangunkusumo hospita.this laboratory is GMP (good manufacturing Product) certified. The samples ate cultured in appropriated medium until it reach confluence and harvested. The cells then undergo caracterisation test by flow cyto meter and viability and numbers are counted. Some of the cells then cryopreserved while some are directly implanted into patient. The cells are cryopreserved for three months and then reactivated. Viability and numbers then are measured. The cells then are implanted to non union patient.\n\nSpecimen sterility Sterility tests are done three times to ensure there is no fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nHA-CaSO4 and MSC For every centimeter of defect, 10 millions cells and 50 pellet HA-CaSO4 are needed. The diluted MSC then mix with the HA-CaSO4 and incubated 5 minutes before implanted.\n\nIntervention Surgical intervention is needed to assemble the fixation device in the long bone. During the surgery, pellet HA-CaSO4 are inserted into the defect. After soft tissue are closed the rest of the serum is injected into the defect area.\n\nObservation and follow up Clinical and radiological follow up is done every 4 weeks. Observation is done for 12 months or untill the bone unites. Every subject will be followed up in the third, sixth, twelfth and twenty forth or until the fixation device is taken off.\n\nRecipient criteria for non union fracture"

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is notoriously difficult to cure with 37% of patients experiencing refractory disease. As a result, patients cycle through numerous immunosuppressive medications that can have significant side effects, and >90% undergo multiple surgical interventions putting them at risk of incontinence.\n\nThe specific rationale for MSCs in perianal Crohn's fistulas is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; 2) several studies reporting the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of perianal Crohn's fistula; 3) existence of safe manufacturing methods for isolation and expansion of MSCs.\n\nThis study will enroll 20 participants that have Crohn's disease with medically and surgically refractory perianal fistulizing disease. Participants enrolled will be those that meet particular criteria for participation in the clinical trial.\n\nEnrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved, participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and again three months after this as above, and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months."

                              "Chronic Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\uff0c with the incidence of 30%-60%, is a serious late complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is the major cause of death in the late stage of transplantation. According to targeted organs, cGVHD is divided into two types, limited cGVHD and extensive cGVHD. Extensive cGVHD needs systemic immunosuppressant treatment. However, currently standard first-line regimen including cyclophosphamide and prednisolone is only effective for some patients. Novel treatment is urgently needed. Our previous study has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective for cGVHD patients with multiple skin damage. To further explore the therapeutic effect of MSCs for extensive cGVHD, we plan to conduct a multi-center clinical trial. Patients who developed an extensive cGVHD (with skin and/or liver damage) after HSCs transplantation and do not respond to first-line therapy are enrolled. They will be randomly divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and routine second-line drugs respectively. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSCs for extensive cGVHD by comparison of symptom improvement, survival rate, recurrence as well as side effects in the two groups."

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.\n\nThis study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.\n\nPatients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months post initial injection."

In this open-labeled study, a maximum of 20 patients will eventually receive intramyocardial injection of the allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells and 10 control patients with no cell injection. The enrollment of the patients will occur in two stages groups: Group A and Group B. In Group A, 10 consecutive HLHS patients will be initially enrolled in the allogenic MSCs treatment arm to determine feasibility and safety. After 6 months of the last enrolled patient in Group A, all Group A patients will be assessed in order to determine whether it is feasible and safe, including the harvesting, processing, and administering of the allogeneic MSCs. Thereafter, Group B will start enrolling a total of 20 HLHS patients which will be randomized to the treatment and control arms in a 1:1 ratio, respectively, in order to have 10 allogeneic MSCs-treated patient and 10 control patients. At the completion of this Phase I clinical study, the total enrolled cohort will be 20 patients treated with allogeneic MSCs and 10 patients in the control arm."

Based on previous literature, intravenous administration of MSC-generated exosomes post stroke improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis and represents a novel treatment for stroke.

                              "Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Since 25 years, patients with moderate to severe emphysema are treated with inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Currently, consensus is developing that this anti-inflammatory treatment is not effective to halt progression of emphysema. Therefore, emphysema may be classified as steroid-resistant and requires new anti-inflammatory treatment approaches, including cellbased therapies. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response in various diseases, including steroid-resistant transplant rejection, Crohn's disease and possibly emphysema as indicated by our pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .\n\nObjective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.\n\nStudy design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.\n\nStudy population: patients between age 45 and 65; a gradient of emphysema severity towards the lung apex as assessed by CT-derived lung densitometry and equally distributed between left and right lung; FEV1 between 20% and 45% pred; Gas diffusion capacity between 30% and 45% pred. Intervention (if applicable): MSC infusions with cryo-preserved MSC in a dose of 2 x 106 /kg body weight in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg ( at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) in a covered bag or NaCl 0.9% with 5% DMSO in a covered bag, both produced in the GMP facility of LUMC.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: LVRS is a routine procedure for treatment of emphysema and received a positive recommendation from the Cochrane Institute. The dose of MSC has been infused in over 200 patients in LUMC only causing mild side effects like fever and headache, mostly related to DMSO, which is present as a cryoprotectant in the verum. Placebo may also cause fever and headache (DMSO). For the study, additional physical exams will be performed 6 monthly for a period of 3 years after LVRS2 and additional blood sampling specific for the study protocol will be 50ml in total. A heparinized blood sample of 10 ml per sample will be taken: 1) just before the 1st LVRS while patient is under general anaesthesia, 2) just before the 1st MSC iv, 3) just before the 2nd MSC iv, 4) just before the 2nd LVRS while the patient is under general anaesthesia. Discomfort for the patient caused by the experimental treatment will be minimal while there is no reason to assume that hospital admission for the surgery will be prolonged by the cell therapy or placebo. The risks associated with the investigational treatment are low as the reported adverse events in Toetsing Online from previous MSC studies in LUMC show only mild to moderate severity. The risk-benefit analysis is low."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) can cure many hematologic diseases. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, poor graft function (PGF) remains an important complication that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or repeat transplantation, but these methods are associated with short-term effect and a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease\uff08GVHD\uff09 development, respectively.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of PGF that develops after allo-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor is rarely reported. If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with PGF after allo-HSCT."

The ultimate therapeutic goal in such cases is cardiac transplantation which is restricted by donor availability. Alternatively, left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly used as bridge to transplantation or more recently as destination therapy in non-transplant candidates. Widely used second- and third-generation continuous-flow LVAD offer symptomatic relief and prolong life. However, LV unloading rarely improves native heart function in ischemic hearts. We aim to increase myocardial viability and improve native cardiac function in patients with end-stage ICM by injecting allogeneic bone marrow stem cells at the time of LVAD implantation."

The study will randomize 20 participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with MSCs, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at the month 6 time point."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders, hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy in this vulnerable population."

                              "Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or abnormality of factor VIII. It is the most common inherited coagulation protein deficiency with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000 males. More than 75% of hemophilic patients suffer the severe type of the disease.\n\nHemophilia treatments are readily available in developed countries; however, it is estimated that 70% of people with this disease worldwide are undiagnosed or undertreated. Moreover, about 20% of hemophilia A patients develop inhibitors to treatment and consequently are difficult to treat.\n\nExogenous factor 8 replacement for hemophilia patients presents a great financial and medical challenge. The optimum therapeutic option for these patients is to provide endogenous secretion of the factor. This was proposed through liver transplantation. Liver transplantation in human and canine hemophilia A results in an increase in factor VIII levels to normal and thus cures the bleeding diathesis. Given the problems of donor availability, major operative procedure and the need for lifelong immunosuppression, cell-based therapy using isolated hepatocytes has been proposed as a promising option to treat clotting disorders. The therapeutic effectiveness of human hepatocytes transplanted under the kidney capsules of mice has been demonstrated. Transplantation of wild-type rats with deficient bilirubin conjugation after ischemia/reperfusion damage resulted in 30% decrease in serum bilirubin, the appearance of bilirubin conjugates in bile and the expression of normal glucuronyltransferase enzyme denoting that transplantation of a small number of hepatocytes can result in partial correction of functional defects.\n\nAlthough cellular transplantation of hepatocytes solves the operative risk, it has the disadvantage of difficult propagation of hepatocytes in vitro.\n\nAn alternative to hepatocyte transplantation is the use of in-vitro transdifferentiated bone marrow derived stem cells.\n\nIn the past few years, a novel option to regenerate damaged liver from bone marrow-derived cells has been proposed by many investigators. Studies showed that bone marrow cells not only differentiated into hepatic and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells but they also expressed the intact gene of the FVIII A3 domain.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells have many advantages as candidates for cellular therapy. They can be propagated in-vitro, do not evoke immune reaction as they express only human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, and have been proven to adopt hepatocyte phenotype in vitro.\n\nIn hemophilia A patients, the mother is a carrier, the father is completely normal, and the female siblings have a 50% chance of being normal or carrier. Thus, the possibility of finding an HLA-matched donor with normal FVIII activity in the family is present. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have the following advantaged over BM-HSCs:\n\nMSCs can differentiate into both hepatic and endothelial phenotypes\nMSCs do not express HLA antigens except HLA-G which caused immunosuppression, thus matching for MSC transplantation can be easier.\n\nThe hypothesis of the present study is to use allogenic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells induced to adopt hepatocyte phenotype in vitro as a cellular therapy product in hemophilia patients.\n\nDonors will be subjected to:\n\nBone marrow aspiration under local or short general anaesthesia, 40-60ml BM will be collected on heparinized syringes.\nMononuclear cell fraction will be separated using SEPAX machine (Biosafe)\nMSCs will be isolated using plastic adherence and subjected to hepatic induction using sequential fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor addition under GMP conditions.\nVerification of hepatic induction will be done using morphological, molecular and proteomic screening.\nCells will then be harvested using 0.25% trypsin, washed and suspended in sterile saline in a dose of 2 million cells per kg body weight in a final volume of 5ml and injected into the hepatic parenchyma under sonographic monitoring."

                              "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary insufficiency eventually resulting in death. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and non-productive cough, often accompanied by digital clubbing. Due to the insidious onset of symptoms, however, most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after significant fibrosis has occurred. Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia, \"dry\" inspiratory crackles on auscultation, and occasional digital clubbing (6). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) usually reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and six-minute walk distances. Diagnosis is established by the pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia (with sub epithelial fibroblastic foci) by open lung biopsy (7), and/or by high resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrating the characteristic findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular changes with fibrosis, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis (8, 9).\n\nThe prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is uniformly poor. The natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline interspersed with \"exacerbations\" or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal (5). There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and thus no standard of care. In cases of patients under the age of 60 with limited comorbid disease, lung transplant may be offered. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) receive empiric treatment, supportive care alone, and more recently, are offered enrollment in clinical trials.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by epithelial cell injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and eventual loss of function. Because mesenchymal stem cells are known to home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)."

                              "As with other major joints of the lower limb that carry weight (hip, knee), the osteochondral lesion (LOC) of the talus, can be a major source of pain and disability for the affected patient. The LOC of the talus can appear after one (or repeated) traumatic injury, compromises the bone and adjacent cartilage, being able to cause blisters in the cartilage layers, lesions similar to a cyst within the bone under the cartilage, or fracture of the cartilage and the bony layers.\n\nThe ankle joint supports multiple loads of the corporal weight in the daily activities, the reason why the properties of the cartilage in the ankle are different from those that appear in the hip and the knee. In the absence of an injury, the cartilage of the ankle has better resistance and tension properties to face the increase of forces than the hip or knee throughout life.\n\nHowever, once an injury appears, the cartilage of the ankle appears to have less repair capacity compared to the hip or knee. Since the most common cause of LOC of the talus is post-traumatic, the average age of these patients is comparatively lower than that of patients affected by injuries to other joints.\n\nOsteochondral injuries have an incidence of 27 per 10,0000 inhabitants in the USA. They are injuries that usually affect the working population and active sportsperson, producing pain, functional limitation and that probably contribute towards the evolution of an accelerated joint degeneration. Currently, there are multiple treatment modalities used by ankle and foot surgeons. These include debridement and microfractures of the subchondral plaque, utilization of totipotential cells, osteochondral autograft/allograft, tibiotalar arthrodesis, and partial/total ankle arthroplasty. However, no treatment offers a clear superiority over the others.\n\nDebridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically is the most frequently used procedure and involves; the removal of degenerated cartilage and subchondral bone; obtaining firm lesional edges that prevent the spread of the lesion; and finally the stimulation of the bone marrow talar by performing microfractures of the subchondral plate. This with the hope that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Although this fibrocartilage has histological characteristics different from those of native articular cartilage, good results have been reported in 82% of the cases when combining good quality studies in this regard.\n\nThe standard technique is not able to generate a replacement articular cartilage strong enough to support the joint loads to which the ankle is exposed. Therefore, clinical trials seek to increase the traditional treatment of debridement and microfractures with the intra-articular use of totipotent cells at the end of the procedure. Although the results of these series are promising and comparable at least to those of traditional treatment, the absence of comparative studies between them complicates the choice of treatment for both the patient and the surgeon. For this reason, the investigators have designed a prospective, comparative, double-blind study that will allow elucidating which of these interventions is the best alternative for our patients.\n\nGeneral Objective:\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogenic stromal mesenchymal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nTo compare functional and radiological results before versus post-surgery within each group studied (control and experimental)\nTo compare functional results after surgery of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\nTo compare the quality of repair of the tissues of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\n\nWork hypothesis:\n\nThe augmentation treatment of the osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal cells produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with only debridement and microfractures."

                              "Until now, all clinical trials for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) have examined the potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy."

Half of the patients undergoing a HLA-identical allografts who survive beyond 100 days may require long-term immunosuppressive treatment for extensive chronic GVHD, often for more than 2 years. More than one-third of patients with chronic GVHD do not respond to first-line therapy, which often involves combinations of corticosteroids and a calcineurin inhibitor. There is no standard second-line or salvage therapy for these patients and they have a poor outcome.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that can differentiate into various lineages and have been used to repair injured tissues. Recently, MSCs have also shown unique immunomodulatory properties ex-vivo, including inhibition of T-cell proliferation after stimulation by allo-antigens and mitogens, and prevention of the activity of cytotoxic T cells.MSCs have been used for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD and for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD,but rarely have been used for extensive chronic GVHD.\n\nDevelopment of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with extensive chronic GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.\n\nIn this study, a single center randomized, non blinded Phase II clinical trial is proposed to study the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of extensive chronic GVHD newly or refractory to the usual therapeutic measures.\n\nExpanded MSC will be infused at a dose of 2 million cells/kg twice a week for 2 weeks and weekly for the following two weeks (six doses totally)in patients based first-line therapy (steroid plus cyclosporin A ) or their primary immunosuppressive therapies."

                              "Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19), caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which occurs as a growing pandemic in early 2020 and currently represents an emergency state worldwide. Several reports have shown that the first step in the pathogenesis of Sars-Cov-2 is the recognition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor by the virus. This ACE2 receptor is widely distributed on the surface of human cells, especially as type II alveolar cells and capillary endothelium, however bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen are known as immune cells, such as T and lymphocytes. B and macrophages, are negatives to ACE2. These results suggest that immunotherapy can be used to treat infected patients. However, an immunomodulatory capacity cannot be so strong, if just one or two major immunological factors used, as the virus can cause a \"cytokine storm\", such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10 , MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\u03b1, followed by edema, gas exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury and secondary infection that can lead to death. Therefore, avoiding a \"cytokine storm\" may be the key to treating patients infected with Sars-Cov-2. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for immunomodulatory activity, can have beneficial effects in preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm. Because MSCs have been widely used in cell therapy, from basic research to clinical trials. Safety and efficacy have been clearly documented in several clinical trials, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). The objective of the study is to verify the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with SARS-CoV-2."

                              "Thirty (30) patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization will be enrolled in the study.This is a phase II study intended to gain additional safety and efficacy assessments among two dose levels previously studied in a phase I setting. In this study, a 20 million total hMSC dose and a 100 million total hMSC dose will be randomly allocated administered via the Biocardia Helical infusion system in a blinded manner.\n\nThe technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium, which is often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts9, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent a highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "Dry eye disease (DED) is a very common problem seen in patients all over the world. According to an older study the prevalence of DED in a Danish population 30-60 years of age was 11%. Aqueous tear deficient dry eye (ADDE) is a subtype of DED in which the tear production in the lacrimal gland (LG) is impaired. Current treatment of ADDE is only to relieve symptoms as a curative treatment of ADDE does not exist.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in almost all connective tissues and are multipotent stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into several kinds of tissue. Several studies have shown that MSCs reduces inflammation in various diseases. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) have gained considerable attention, since they are readily available from the abdominal fat where it is most easily collected and expanded. In resting MSCs, MHC class II is not expressed on the surface, which reduces the inherent immunogenicity of the cells. This supreme attribute allows allogeneic MSC transplantation. Treatment with allogeneic MSCs have been investigated in an extensive number of human subjects for various conditions in clinical trials and no documented adverse events related to an anti-donor immune response exist. One potential advantage of treatment with allogeneic cells is the possibility of their use as an \"off-the-shelf\" therapeutic agent, avoiding the need for tissue collection and culture to delay and increase the cost of treatment. It has also been suggested that the function of autologous MSCs could be impaired in patients with comorbidities or advanced age.\n\nIn canines as in humans the most common cause of ADDE is an immune-mediated inflammatory response targeting the LG. Two studies with injection of allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors in a total of 48 eyes in 27 canines with ADDE have been performed with a significant increase in tear production and no observed adverse events to the treatment.\n\nStudies with injection of ASCs into the human LG has never been conducted. This present study will test the hypothesis that injection of allogeneic ASCs into the LG in patients suffering from ADDE is safe and increases tear production and reduces inflammation resulting in increased ocular comfort.\n\n7 patients with severe ADDE from Dept. of Ophthalmology, Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, will be recruited if they are 1: eligible for the study and 2: sign the informed consent form.\n\nAt inclusion the participants will fill out the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and undergo an eye examination in the following order:\n\nmeasurement of tear osmolarity (TearLab\u2122), tear break-up time (TBUT), ocular surface staining according to the Ocular SICCA Grading Score, and Schirmer's I test.\n\nAfter a maximum of 14 days from screening all participants will receive an injection with ASCs into the lacrimal gland on one eye. If both eyes fulfill the eligibility criteria the most affected eye with the lowest tear production assessed with the Schirmer's I test will be the study eye; the contralateral eye will not be treated but examined according to the same protocol as the study eye at each follow-up.\n\nThe product used is CSCC_ASC(22) and the dose injected contains approximately 11 million ASCs per LG in a suspension with a total volume of 0.5 ml.\n\n1 week (\u00b12 days), 4 weeks (\u00b14 days), and 4 months (\u00b17 days) after intervention the participants are followed up with eye examination as described above, OSDI questionnaire, and blood test. At 4 months the primary outcomes of safety will be evaluated.\n\nEnd of trial is defined as last participant's last visit (LPLV) at 3 years late follow-up."

                              "Ischemic limb disease remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world despite the development of several new therapeutic modalities. Based on experimental data demonstrating that infusion or injection of stem/progenitor cells enhances blood flow in models of cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials were initiated in 2001 to treat patients with critical limb ischemia or cardiac ischemia with circulating blood or bone marrow-derived cells. Despite all promises, pending uncertainties and practical limitations attenuate the therapeutic use of stem/progenitor cells for ischemic limb disease. The main theme and method in the current program project, based on expertise, track record, and preliminary results of PI's laboratory, is to focus on clinical studies of using allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), expanded under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), in treating ischemic limbs. This project is an integrated and coordinated effort aimed to overcome the regulation of cell product, and the barriers of preclinical and clinical studies. For the purposes, we have specially set up the core laboratory for stem/progenitor cells production and quality control in Cell Therapy Clean Room on the 9th floor of Medical Science Technology Building in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We have also completed the preclinical studies in using allogenic hypoxic mouse MSCs in treating limb ischemia. In the current project, bone marrow MSCs will be isolated from allogenic donors, expanded under hypoxic conditions using medium containing no serum or animal-derived reagents, and applies for Phase \u2160/\u2161 study in treating 18 recipients with ischemic limb diseases in three years."

                              "STUDY TREATMENT:\n\nInvestigational therapy product: Wharton Jelly derived allogeneic MSCs.\n\nMethod of administration and dose: Super selective intravenous administration of 50 million Allogeneic Human Umbilical Cord Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) and intrathecal administration of UC-MSCs in dose of 100 million along with liberation therapy (when associated with CCSVI).\n\nSAFETY AND EFFICACY EVALUATION:\n\nThe proposed study will assess safety and primary and secondary efficacy endpoints after super selective intravenous and intrathecal administration of allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) in 69 patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nSafety Evaluation:\n\nAssessment of treatment safety based on incidence of any treatment emergent/treatment associated adverse events prior to discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment.\n\nEfficacy evaluation:\n\nClinical evaluations, including EDSS and 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization, prior to discharge at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after stem cell therapy.\n\nThe MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consists of the (a) Timed 25-Foot Walk, (b) 9 Hole Peg Test, and (c) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization and at 12 months after stem cell therapy.\n\nGadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain will be performed at baseline before therapy and then 12 months after stem cell therapy. Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of scanner used at baseline. Scans will be analyzed centrally. The 'baseline MRI scan' will be the reference for brain volume changes.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nDescriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed. Proportion of adverse events at each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution. The frequency, severity, timing and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize the safety of the intervention.\n\nThe probability of overall event-free survival (as well as progression-free, relapse-free, or MRI event-free survival) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated. The end point of progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater than 0.5 from baseline. Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with Wald-type 90% CIs based on Greenwood's formula for SE.\n\nDescriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using descriptive statistics. Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this efficacy measurement scales (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion.\n\nThe percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of those who have not met the end point by month 12.\n\nOther primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value minus the baseline value. The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from baseline measurement in the values at the month 1, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits was significantly different from zero,with baseline measurement defined as the screening assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other end points.\n\nTo calculate MSFC, results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint. The z scores that compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database."

The infusions will be carried out nested at cyclophosphamide application cycles ten days after each application of the cyclophosphamide schedule for each patient. To assess safety and therapeutic effects, the occurrence of any adverse event will be described from start of infusion until the conclusion of the trial in six months.\n\nTo assess the response, a pre-infusion and sixth-month post-infusion instrument will be applied that includes clinical variables, paraclinical and hemodynamic tests to evaluate skin involvement using the modified RODNAN score, changes in nail capillaroscopy, lung function and structural involvement by high-resolution chest tomography (hrCT), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and a 6-minute walk. As part of the cardiovascular assessment, cerebral natriuretic peptide (BNP), transthoracic echocardiogramwill be performed; The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review(CAMPHOR) and Sysq will be used as tools for the assessment of pulmonary hypertension. A comparison of these tests before initiation of therapy and after completion of 24 weeks of infusion scheme should be performed."

Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection.

UC is characterized by persistent mucosal inflammation of the colon and rectum with a chronic remitting and relapsing behavior which leaves patients on chronic immunosuppression and hospitalizations to treat the disease symptoms, but unable to cure the disease. Despite the ever-growing armamentarium of immunosuppressive medication, up to 30% of patients still require a colectomy for medically refractory disease.\n\nParticipants with medically refractory ulcerative colitis will be treated by targeted endoscopic delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected into the submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.\n\nPatients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.\n\nThere will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150 million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24 participants.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory ulcerative colitis."

                              "Osteoarthritis of the knee (Knee Osteoarthritis, Knee OA) is a joint disease that primarily affects cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within the joint. In people who suffer from knee OA, articular cartilage top is broken down and worn away, resulting in the underlying bones to rub against each other. This friction can cause pain, joint swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM). Eventually, the joint may become deformed and bone spurs may form around the edges. With the advances in biotechnology, cell therapy in the application of cartilage reconstruction has gradually matured. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) injection of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for knee OA. The same cell products used in this trial have been applied in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in Taiwan for the treatment of critical limb ischemia, and so far no treatment-related adverse effect has been observed. In the current trial, allogeneic bone marrow MSCs of up to 4 donors will be isolated. BM MSCs are expanded and applied for a phase I/IIa study in treating 15-24 recipient patients with knee OA. The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first stage is a traditional 3+3 open dose-escalated study design with three cohorts of dosing groups: (1) 1 x 10^7 cells, (2) 5 x 10^7 cells and (3) 10 x 10^7 cells. At the second stage, knee OA patients will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as determined by the results of the first stage. All the study subjects will be followed up to 6 months (24 weeks) after the treatment for safety and preliminary efficacy evaluation, which the latter will include both clinical and imaging study assessments."

                              "Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has spread quickly from Wuhan China to worldwide. On 15 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1.914.916 confirmed cases and 123.010 deaths globally, being a severe threat to public health.\n\nSome patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure. Several reports demonstrated that COVID-19 specifically recognized the angiotensin I converting ezyme 2 repector (ACE2) and ACE2-positive cells are infected by the virus. ACE2 receptor is widely present on the human cells surface such as alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelium, among others. COVID-19 infects cells and stimulates a terrible cytokine storm in the lung followed by edema, dysfunction of the air exchange and acute respiratory distress which may lead to death. Further, once COVID-19 enters in blood circulation, it can easy spread to some systems and organs, causing significant damage. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to believe that the inhibition of inflammatory response is the key to treat COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. Some studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 virus, reducing proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells into the lungs.\n\nThese immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the Phase I/II, double-blind (neither the participant nor the investigator will know if active drug or placebo is assigned), placebo-controlled, randomized (assigned by chance), in which subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia shall be received either MSCs (1 million cells/kg) or placebo by intravenous injection. The administration of cells will be done only once."

                              "Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is an important perinatal cause of long-lasting neurodevelopmental problems. Recent studies report an incidence of PAIS of 1 per 2300 full-term infants born alive. Adverse consequences of PAIS include hemiplegia, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy and speech problems. In 50-75% of infants, neonatal stroke leads to abnormal neuromotor and -developmental outcome or epilepsy. The estimated annual mortality rate of neonatal stroke is 3.49/100,000 annually. Current treatment options for PAIS mainly focus on controlling convulsions and associated infections. There is no treatment available that leads to reduction of neonatal brain damage in this severely affected group of infants. This leads to life-long consequences of PAIS and forms a large burden for patients and society. The overall aim of this project is to meet this need by developing a cell based treatment strategy. Animal models of neonatal brain injury provide evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of intranasal mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) application in the treatment of PAIS. Additionally, results from human trials with MSCs in the treatment of adult stroke or other pathologic conditions provide evidence that MSC treatment is safe. This project aims at making the first step towards clinical application of MSCs to treat PAIS. Successful completion of this project will provide the first evidence of the safety and feasibility of MSCs to treat brain damage in newborn infants. This study will assess safety and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs, administered by the nasal route, in neonates who suffered from PAIS."

Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

                              "The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS. Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies, directed against human differentiation antigens (CD34, CD45, CD14, CD90, CD73, CD29, CD49b, CD166), conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (CFI) or phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from BD Biosciences (USA).\n\nIsolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) obtained from human bone marrow. In the present study, isolated EMFs from bone marrow (BM) from patients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic nonunion (failure of a bone union at fracture sites) will be used. These cells were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these patients. The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at the University Hospital of Caracas, Hospital Universitario de Los Andes, Hospital P\u00e9rez de Le\u00f3n II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient through informed consent. In this protocol, the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture in the iliac crest. This procedure was performed in the operating room, under anesthesia and by a medical specialist. The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) with heparin (Sanofi Aventis). The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium (Irvine Scientific, USA) enriched with 20% autologous serum. These cells were kept in culture in a controlled environment at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells were eliminated, and a basal culture medium (alpha-MEM-Chang / 20% autologous serum) was added. Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs. Culture medium exchanges were made until reaching a confluence close to 70-80%. The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures, following the process described above. Microbiological examinations were performed after obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation. After using MSC, a batch of these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C.\n\nPhenotypic characterization of MSC. Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried out by flow cytometry. For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask by using trypsin-like enzymes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD29, CD166 and CD49b) and hematopoietic (CD34, CD45 and CD14). Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100% of the cells used for transplantation in each patient were MSC.\n\nMSC differentiation studies. The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined by culturing these cells in osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media, following a methodology similar to that previously described. Briefly, the MSCs were detached and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well, proceeding to add the corresponding differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone (100nM, Biotech), ascorbic acid (10mM, Sigma), inorganic phosphate (1.8mM, Merck) and beta-glycerol phosphate (2mM, Sigma). For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes (Cell Application, USA) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial medium NH Adipodiff Human (Miltenyi, USA) was used. In all cases, the cells were kept in culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days. To demonstrate the changes associated with the differentiation process, the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (Merck, USA) and specific stains were performed for each case. Briefly, alizarin red to detect calcium deposition (evidence of osteogenesis), Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans (evidence of chondrogenesis), and oil red (Oil Red) to see lipids (evidence of adipogenesis). In all cases, microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out. For endothelial differentiation (CEn), EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, USA) enriched with 10% autologous serum, 10\u00b5g / ml of human epidermal growth factor (hu-EGF, R&D) and hydrocortisone (1\u00b5g / ml, Sigma).\n\nMSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. All MSC processing procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to induce bone regeneration. The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been phenotypically and functionally characterized. The MSC will be thawed, grown and expanded as previously described. A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs, and another part will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium (CEM-Endo). Once the required number of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached, a suspension of these cells (75,000 cells from each of them) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium, without phenol red, supplemented with 20% autologous serum. Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar, at room temperature, to the Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (IVIC).\n\nUnder sterile conditions, the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth area; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC / MSC-Endo / PRP implant. At the same time, the culture medium supernatant is removed from each tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo \"button (pellet)\" is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension, 5% CaCl2 and thrombin will be added. Immediately, and before the clot forms, 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP suspension will be placed in the root canal, covered with a collagen membrane. Subsequently, the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp chamber, ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the tooth.\n\nPost-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF\n\nClinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of EMC.\nRadiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of mesenchymal stromal cells.\nA tomographic evaluation will be performed when the periapical repair will be evident in a periapical radiograph."

In addition significant evidence of their effectiveness and safety is valid only for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The transplantation of allogeneic stem cells is a promising direction in the modern medicine with the proven safety for different diseases. But the effectiveness of this therapy is still under research.

Following 1 month data review of each of the six subjects by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board; this was followed by a randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolling thirty-one subjects. These subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive allo-MSCs or placebo. All subjects underwent cardiac catheterization and study product administration using the NOGA Myostar catheter injection system. Subjects are being followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post study product injection. All endpoints are assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 180 \u00b130 days and 365 \u00b130 days, respectively, after the day of study product injection (Day 0).

                              "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders, affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to the respiratory failure. Numerous studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the clinical and pathological features of ALS patients. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine) effect of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to enrollment. Patients are recruited for a clinical trial no more than 1 year from the disease diagnosis. Then, patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one application of WJ-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications (each administration every two months) of WJ-MSCs. Subsequently, allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period."

                              "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established therapeutic modality for high risk hematological malignancies in adults and children. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality after HCT is graft versus host disease (GVHD), affecting up to 70% of patients even with current prophylaxis and directly accounting for approximately a third of regimen-related death. Currently, pharmacologic prophylaxis consists of a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate, a drug combination introduced around 40 years ago. Despite this regimen being recognized as the standard of care, it is only partially effective, increases the risk of infection and disease relapse and imparts drug-related, short- and long-term adverse effects. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potent immune modulatory activity which is markedly enhanced by exposure to interferon \u03b3. In murine models, interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) primed MSCs (\u03b3MSCs) potently suppress GVHD without untoward adverse effects suggesting this cell therapy may markedly reduce the regimen related toxicity of HCT; however \u03b3MSCs have never been infused into patients.\n\nThis protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that freshly expanded \u03b3MSCs can be reliably produced and safely infused into patients undergoing HCT as GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nThis is an investigator-initiated Phase I study using a rolling 6, dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual to the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined in adults. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for a future Phase II study to demonstrate efficacy and support a Phase III randomized trial.\n\nThe researchers plan to enroll a minimum of 4 and maximum of 45 subjects who are greater than 1 year old. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after the HCT. The study will be conducted at Emory University and will recruit participants from the Winship Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital in Atlanta at Egleston."

However, despite the current major progress in diagnosis and microsurgical repair, the prognosis in TBPI remains unfavorable due to limited donor nerve and compromised regenerative capability of the nervous system arising from prolonged denervation. Therefore, there is a major need to devise new treatment strategies; and one possible approach is to develop cellular therapies to bioengineer new nerve tissue and/or modulate the endogenous regenerative mechanisms within the injured nerve.\n\nOur previous studies have shown that the peripheral nerve tissue engineering approach using human amniotic membrane seeded with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs to augment axonal regeneration in nerve transfer of TBPI patient revealed promising functional recovery of the shoulder range of motion (ROM). The investigators plan a non-randomized clinical trial in a single center to investigate the use of a hybrid (composite) between human amniotic membrane (HAM) and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC) as wrapping in the nerve transfer procedure of upper TBPI patients, with a focus on the augmentation of axonal regeneration"

Preoperative scintigraphy imaging (SPECT) will be used to identify hibernating myocardium not suitable for conventional myocardial revascularization for iMP implantation. iMP cells will be implanted intramyocardially in predefined viable peri-infarct areas that show poor perfusion, which could not be grafted due to poor target vessel quality. Postoperatively, SPECT will be used to identify changes in scar area."

The mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or fibrinolytic therapy. Basically, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of myocardial infarction (MI) presentations. Acute STEMI is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and disability.\n\nThis product is a new cell therapy product for treating AMI and produced by Ever Supreme Bio Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its effectiveness for AMI and stroke. The rats with coronary artery ligation receiving intravenous injection of UMSC01 showed significantly improved cardiac function."

Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and determine its suitability as a form of treatment."

For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nAs current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine in the treatment of psoriasis.\n\nThis study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nTherefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to participate in this study will be interviewed."

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment and can decrease their serum cholesterol to near normal levels (Bilheimer DW, N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1658-64). Shortage of donor organ is a major problem for OLT. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organ. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders (such as Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Fox IJ, et al. N Engl J Med 1998;338:1422-6), Factor VII deficiency (Dhawan A et al. Transplantation 2004:78:1812-4), Glycogen storage disease type Ia (Muraca M, et al. Lancet 2002;359:317-8), etc) by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. Although, in the in-vivo system there is a controversy that if stem cells transdifferentiate into hepatocytes or fusion of stem cells and hepatocytes occur, however, in the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented (Lee KD, et al. Hepatology 2004;40:1275-1284; & Banas A, et al. Hepatology. 2007;46:219-28). We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 female patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of ABO compatible healthy male volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes in the in-vitro culture system. Then the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."

Therefore, it is urgent to develop a more effective therapy for SLE disorder, especially for treatment-refractory patients.\n\nBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are known to be effective in modulating immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and Neutral Killer (NK) cells and treating acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Also, based on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been widely studied as a candidate for the treatment of refractory immune- and inflammation-mediated disease, and have extensive experience of use.\n\nHalf-matched allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the active ingredient of CS20AT04 Injection, not only have the potential to differentiate into various mesenchymal cells but also have various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and thus are expected to induce and maintain remission of lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the following.

                              "Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event, especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over 10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute respiratory impairment.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nAlthough human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use.\n\nThe purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."

The dose-escalation methods with a modified continual reassessment at the five dose levels (1x10^6, 10x10^6, 20x10^6, 40x10^6, 80x10^6, cells/kg) will be performed to determine safety and feasibility of allogeneic BM-MSC infusion during pediatric cardiac surgery and the maximum tolerated dose in infants with CHD. In addition to the primary objective of assessing the safety and feasibility of BM-MSC delivery through CPB, our secondary objectives are designed to develop biological signature measures and clinical outcome measures feasible for use in larger efficacy and effectiveness trials with a particular focus on neurodevelopmental outcome and early postoperative course after BM-MSC treatment. We will determine actual magnitude of differences in neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental variables and postoperative inflammatory and pathophysiological variables after BM-MSC delivery in infants with CHD. Enrollment, follow-up, and analysis are planned to occur over 36 months for the treatment and initial follow-up portions of the study. Long-term follow-up until 18 months of age will be subsequently reported."

Bone marrow (50 ml) will be collected from unrelated donors under local anesthesia, mononuclear cells will be isolated, and cultured for a total of about 4 weeks. After a sufficient number of passages, the cells will be harvested, washed and frozen.\nMSC injections MSC will be thawed and diluted at the Laboratory of Cell and Gene Therapy (LTCG), transported to the hospital ward and injected intravenously within 1 hour of thawing through a central catheter (when available) or a good peripheral vein. A dose of 1.5 - 2.0 x 106/kg recipient MSC should be ideally administered at each infusion. MSC will be infused even if the number of post-thaw cells is lower than that. Patients with Crohn's disease will receive two injections of allogenic MSC 4 weeks apart (week 0 and 4).\nPatients Follow up\n\n3.1. Quality controls of MSC products Quality controls of MSC product will include microscopy, nucleated cell count and differential, cell viability testing, microbiology testing (including standard virology, bacterial culture and detection of mycoplasmal enzymes by bioluminescence, endotoxin testing, karyotype and FACS analysis (cells must be positive for :CD90 > 70%,CD105 > 70 %,CD73 > 70 %; and negative for :CD14 < 5%,CD34 < 5%, CD45 < 5%, CD3 < 1%).\n\n3.2. Toxicities of cell infusions: Potential toxicities associated with MSC infusions will be carefully monitored per the institution's standards and documented on the infusion report and/or the SAE report form. No dosage modifications are scheduled. In case of severe reaction to the first MSC infusion, the second infusion will not be performed.\n\n3.3. Clinical data The following parameters will be followed at baseline as well as at week 2, 4, 8 and 12 : CDAI level, CRP levels, fecal calprotectin levels. In addition, duration of hospitalization, infections, any other serious complication, and eath and survival will be recorded.\n\n3.4. Immunologic data: Immune function in the patient will be monitored at baseline and appropriate intervals: nucleated cell count and differential; FACS analysis with determination of the % cells (on total WBC) with the markers :CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD45RA+, CD45RO+, CD56+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+; CD3+CD56+; CD4+CD45RA+, CD4+CD45RO+; CD3-CD56+; regulatory T-cell (Treg) levels; immunoglobulin levels, V\u03b2 repertoire of T lymphocytes; TRECs quantification in T lymphocytes."

                              "Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (uc-MSC).\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design."

It is characterized by cardiovascular collapse, failure of organs and is common with severe repercussions including a mortality of 20-40%. Survivors suffer long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models, MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore organ function, and reduce death.\n\nThe Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims, CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300 million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian centres over approximately 2 years."

This matched case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between June 2020 and December 2021. In this study, 40 patients will be enrolled and assigned into two age-, gender- and COPD condition-matched groups, including a UC-MSC group and a control group. Both groups will receive standard COPD medication treatment based on the GOLD 2019 guidelines and the Vietnam Ministry of Health protocol. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product with an intervention interval of 3 months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administrationassociated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The efficacy will be evaluated based on the absolute changes in the number of admissions, arterial blood gas analysis, lung function and lung fibrosis via CT scan and chest X-ray. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post"

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many hematologic diseases. However, poor graft function (PGF) is an important complication after allo-HSCT that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or second transplantation, but these methods are associated with dismal effect or even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs might be effective in the treatment of PGF.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF is unsatisfactory in our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF after allo-HSCT."

This trial test the hypothesis that MSCs, in a dose dependent fashion, promote the frequency and immune suppressor function of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells and decrease AAA inflammation as measured by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The primary safety endpoints will be incidence of treatment related adverse events accrued over 24 months. Efficacy measures are changes in frequency and immune suppressor function of Tregs, number and cytotoxic activity of CD4+/CD8+ CD28- T-cells, activated monocytes, and changes in aortic inflammation as measured by uptake of 18-FDG PET/CT compared to baseline. Incidence of surgical intervention, aneurysm related death, quality of life, and major adverse cardiac events will be recorded."

In recent years, the incidence of ARDS has increased significantly, which has significantly increased the social and economic burden. The impact of ARDS can even be compared with tumors, AIDS or myocardial infarction. There are the basic clinical treatments, such as using various ventilation methods to improve hypoxia and choosing alternative therapies to improve renal insufficiency. Therefore, there is still a lack of specific treatment measures.\n\nExosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. Studies have confirmed that MSC-Exos can improve most of the pathological changes caused by lung infection, reduce pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, reduce alveolar inflammation, and clear bacterial infections. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of ARDS.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (hMSC-Exos) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"

                              "Adipose tissue samples will be obtain through liposuction procedures of three healthy volunteers undergoing aesthetic surgery at Clementino Fraga Filho (the hospital of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Donors\u00b4sorology wil have to be negative for syphilis, Chagas disease, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C, HIV 1 and 2, and Cytomegalovirus.\n\nThe adipose tissue-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) that wil be extract on healthy volunteers will be isolate, culture and samples will be process at Core Cell Technology of Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1. Briefly, the procedures are:\n\n100 ml of adipose tissue will be wash in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco Invitrogen). A one-step digestion by 1 mg/ml collagenase type I (Invitrogen) will be performe for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C during permanent shaking, follow by filtration step through a 100 \u00b5m mesh filter (BD FALCON, BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA, USA). The cell suspension will be centrifuge at 800 g for 10 minutes, and erythrocytes were removed by lysis buffer, pH 7.3.\nThe remaining cells will be wash at 400 g for 10 minutes and then culture at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/cm2 in T75 culture flasks and DMEM-F12 (Gibco Invitrogen) supplemente with 10% of fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml). The culture medium will be replace three days after seeding, and then twice a week.\nASCs will be subculture after reaching 80% confluence, with 0.5% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) solution. Cells will be replate at a density of 4x103 cells/cm2 for expansion11A.\nQuality control of cell suspension sterility will be evaluate by tests to detect bacteria and fungi (Bact / Alert 3D, Biomerieux), endotoxins (Endosafe \u2122 PTS, Charles River) and Mycoplasma (KIT MycoAlert \u2122 PLUS Mycoplasma Detection, Lonza). Cell viability will be performe by flow cytometry using the vital dye 7-AAD (7-Aminoactinomycin D - BD#559925) to determine the percentage of viable cells and Annexin V protein (BD#51-65875X) to determine the percentage of cells in apoptosis. Cytogenetic analysis wil be performe by GTG-banding method.\nCells will be phenotypically characterize by flow cytometry before the clinical application, using the following monoclonal antibodies: FITC-labeled CD14 (BD#555397), CD45 (BD#555482), CD19 (BD#555412), CD44 (BD#555478); PE-labeled CD73 (BD#550257), CD90 (BD#555596), CD166 (BD#559263), PerCP-labeled HLA-DR (BD#551375); APC-labeled CD34 (BD#555824), CD105 (BD#562408), CD29 (BD#559883) all purchased from BD (Pharmingen). At least 100.000 events wil bel acquire on a BD FACSCalibur\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data wil be analyzed using FlowJo 10 (TreeStar) software11A.\n\nAfter the ASCs extraction, isolate, culture and process, the infusion in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes wil be according as describe bellow:\n\nAt the day of infusion, ASCs monolayer wil be dissociate as described above and 1x106 cells/kg of the recipient patient wil be ressuspend in 5 ml of saline solution with 50% albumin and 5% anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution. Cell suspension wil send to the hospital in a cooler with recycled ice.\nPatients that wil receive ASCs wil be admitte to the hospital in the day of the infusion and wil discharge 24 hours after infusion. A single dose of ASCs wil be infuse in a peripheral upper arm vein during 15-20 minutes. Patients wil start takking oral cholecalciferol 2000 UI one day after the ASCs infusion.\n\nSafety Tests: adverse events wil be record during the hospitalization (T0) and at each follow-up outpatient visit (3 [T3], 6 [T6], 12 [T12], 18 [T18], and 24 [T24] months after the ASCs infusion), with clinical and laboratory exams (blood count, lipids, renal and hepatic function, thyroid stimulating hormone, free tyroxine, antithyroglobulin antibody, calcium, phosphorus and 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D, performed with automated biochemical equipment CMD 800 IX1).\n\nClinical and Pancreatic Function Evaluation: Participants wil be followed for 24 months. On the first visit, all patients wil be interviewed and had a physical exam. Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart frequency, frequency of hypoglycemia and insulin dose/kg of body weight wil be evaluate in the first visit (T0) and after 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 6 (T6) 12 (T12) ,18 (18), and 24 (24) months.\n\nInsulin dose adjustments wil be performe at each visit as necessary. All patients wil receive nutritional guidance according to American Diabetes Association recommendations.\n\nBlood samples wil be drawn prio to ASCs infusion and at T1, T3, T6, T12, T18 and T24 for the measurement the Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c. Method: High Performance Liquid Chromatography by boronate affinity). \u03b2-cell function wil be evaluated through C-Peptide measurement (Microparticle Chemiluminescent Immunoassay method, Architect Abbott) after a liquid mixed meal (Glucerna\u00ae), considering the time 0 (basal), 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The area under the curve wil be calculate.\n\nComparison with previous case-control study using only vitamin D supplementation as intervention:\n\nThe investigators wil compare our results with patients previously included in a case-control study that investigated the effects of daily 2000 UI vitamin D without the infusion of cells in individuals with recent onset type 1 diabetes and similar age (> 15 years old), from a different population (S\u00e3o Paulo) in the same country region (Brazilian Southeast). Therefore, the investigators wil establish three different groups for comparison: 1) patients that wil receive ASCs + Vitamin D supplementation; 2) patients that wil receive only vitamin D supplementation; 3) patients that wil receive the conventional treatment for diabetes but any additional experimental treament (ASCs or Vitamin D).\n\nInsulin dose adjustments or withdrawal wil be performed according to glycemic control. Changes in HbA1c, C-Peptide and insulin dose/kg of body weight wil be compare between groups. C-Peptide wil be analyze by immunofluorometric assay (AutoDelfia) at T0 and T6 and T12 and T18 and T24, considering basal and peak stimulated C-Peptide after mixed meal test (Glucerna)."

Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the preferable treatment modality for patients younger than 40 years with a matched sibling donor. Patients not eligible for transplant are treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy often based on anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine.\n\nHowever, up to one third of patients treated with immunosuppression are refractory and one third of those who response eventually relapse. Refractory and relapsed cases may be the result of insufficient immunosuppression and these cases may benefit from additional immunosuppression. Mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be a potential treatment option, considering its properties to modulate the immune system.\n\nRefractory or relapsed patients with aplastic anemia will be treated with conventional immunosuppressive regimen (anti-thymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine) combined with intravenous infusion of allogeneic unrelated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells."

                              "This phase I, multisite, pilot study will test whether infusions of human cord tissue derived MSCs (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\n\nThe study population will consist of six patients 18 to <21 years old with a life expectancy \u2265 72 hours and COVID-19 related MIS-C that is refractory to treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly recognized, serious, hyper-inflammatory syndrome that is occurring in small numbers of children, many of whom are within a month or so of recovering from a COVID-19 infection. While the clinical presentation varies, affected patients are typically previously healthy individuals who are less than 21 years of age. The diagnostic criteria include fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and multisystem involvement requiring hospitalization. Up to 75% of patients present with an element of cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, with some also requiring intubation with mechanical ventilation. Reported supportive treatments have included intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and aspirin. In the limited cases reported, up to 50% of children with MIS-C have antibodies to COVID-19 in their blood and may or may not be PCR positive on a nasal swab or throat culture. The disease is incompletely understood but currently believed, at least in part, to be a hyper-immune response to a recent COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, MSCs have been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and decrease production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, up to 70% of infused cells are engulfed by lung macrophages, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules by these macrophages. These observations have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may work through both anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and regenerative mechanisms.\n\nOver the past several months, MSCs have been tested in small cohorts of adult patients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to determine if the cytokine storm hypothesized to cause this complication could be suppressed by MSCs. Early results are encouraging, and formal clinical trials are underway. Extending this work into the pediatric population, the hypothesis of this study is that infusion of hCT-MSC can reverse the pro-inflammatory state in children with MIS-C.\n\nThis is a 6 patient, multisite, pilot study to test whether infusions of hCT-MSC are safe in pediatric patients with MIS-C. Information will also be gathered about the duration and severity of the participant's multisystem inflammatory syndrome. hCT-MSCs will be manufactured at Duke University Medical Center in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and shipped frozen to the treatment site, where they will remain stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until the day of dosing.\n\nThe baseline evaluation will include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate), echocardiogram, ECG or telemetry strip, HLA typing, Panel Reactive Antibody (anti-HLA antibody), inflammatory markers, blood counts, blood chemistry, coagulation, and COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests.Patients will be dosed with 2x10^6 hCT-MSCs/kg. Doses will be given on days 1, 2, 3, and a fourth, optional dose may be given on day 7 at the discretion of the investigator and the treating physician. Prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Hydrocortisone, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes via a syringe pump. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluids will be managed by the care team. Afterwards, the participant will continue to be monitored in their care setting per institutional standards. Participants will be evaluated by study staff the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications.\n\nThe participant will be monitored by study staff to assess for any infusion related adverse reactions or complications until discharge. Additional follow-up will occur on days 14, 28, and 90. Follow up testing will include assessment for adverse events as well as the tests done at baseline (with the exception of HLA typing and COVID PCR."

Several studies have shown that the immune system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and umbilical-cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via its immunomodulatory properties have the potential to improve insulin resistance condition and pancreatic beta-cells dysfunction thus improve the glycemic control and insulin requirement in T2D patients.

The safety outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body.

                              "Background:\n\nNephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare disease characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria and the need for steroid treatment. About 50% of children will become frequent relapsers (FRNS) or steroid dependent (SDNS), requiring higher doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for many years, sometimes up to adulthood. Strong evidence suggests that Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), at least in the steroid-sensitive forms, has an immune pathogenesis.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that produce an immunomodulatory activity in-vitro and in-vivo. For this reason, we postulated that SDNS patients could benefit with treatment with MSC.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe main goal of the present study is to assess whether CB-MSCs have the capacity to regulate the immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NS allowing for a reduction or suspension of chronic immunosuppressive treatment in SDNS children. The primary objective is to evaluate whether CB-MSC therapy is able to prevent NS recurrence for at least 6 months after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment in children with SDNS.\n\nPrimary endpoint: percentage of children without NS recurrence after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment for at least 6 months.\n\nPopulation:\n\nWe plan to enroll 11 children (3 to 18 years of age) with SDNS, maintained by chronic immunosuppressive treatment and with stable remission for at least two months.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nOpen label single-arm, monocentric trial, with a rescue/second design\n\nPhase: Phase II\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria:\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAge between 3 and 18 years;\nClinical diagnosis of SDNS;\n\nDisease remission maintained by chronic therapy (at least 6 months) with either:\n\nUse of a combination of 2 or more immunosuppressive drugs\nuse of 1 of the calcineurin inhibitors (Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus);\nAbsence of proteinuria (urinary protein:urinary creatinine < 0.2 mg/mg) for at least 1 month;\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate greater than or equal to 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;\nWritten informed consent from parents or guardians and the child when possible.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nAge < 3 years or \u2265 19 years;\nResistant/refractory NS;\nPresence of genetic mutations associated with NS;\neGFR less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;\nThrombophilic condition;\nPregnancy or lactating;\nEvidence of an uncooperative attitude;\nAny evidence that the patient will be unable to complete the trial follow-up.\n\nDescription of the Intervention:\n\nThe trial will rely on a single advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP), made by MSC from umbilical cord blood (CB) for allogeneic use, produced following a highly standardized process, developed and controlled at Cell Factory under the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines.\n\nAfter baseline clinical and laboratory evaluation, patients will receive 3 intravenous infusions of CB-MSCs at the dosage of 1.5 x 10^6/kg at a time interval of 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe immunosuppressive treatment will be gradually tapered off following the first CB-MSC administration: 25%, 50% and 100% reduction of the ongoing immunosuppressive treatment following the first, second and third administration, respectively.\n\nAt the end of this first part of the trial, a statistical analysis will be performed according to the primary end-point. In the case of failure to reach the primary end point an extra 11 children with SDNS will be enrolled in a single stage phase 2 study with a 30% incremented dose of CB-MSCs.\n\nStatistical Evaluation:\n\nA phase II design with a rescue plan B, is adopted to decide whether the proportion responding is less than or equal to 0.200 or greater than or equal to 0.600. A sample size of 10 children is required, considering a drop out of 10%, 11 children will be enrolled: if the number of responses is 5 or more, the hypothesis that P \u2264 0.200 is rejected with a target error rate of 5%. If the number of responses is 4 or less, the hypothesis that P \u2265 0.600 is rejected with a target error rate of 20% (power equal to 80%). The same statistical hypothesis will apply for the second part of the study.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe results of this proposal will provide information regarding an innovative cell therapy for the treatment of INS. If the hypothesis of this study is confirmed, it will be possible to reduce or withdraw immunosuppressive treatment in this vulnerable population of children with SDNS, reducing the need for ambulatory visits and hospitalization and therapy-related complications. Furthermore, the reduction in the use of immunosuppressive agents as well as in the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions will reduce the financial burden to the National Health Service. Above all, the quality of life of children with SDNS would clearly be improved, in terms of a reduction in long-term therapy, morbidity and the number of visits."

                              "Supraspinatus tendon tear is the most common factor causing shoulder pain, mainly resulting in discomfort and functional deficit in individuals over the age of 35. Supraspinatus tendon repair surgery represents one of the most widely performed types of orthopedic operation. Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding tendon-to-bone healing during the postoperative period. Despite advancements in surgical technique, re-tear of a previously repaired supraspinatus tendon is a fairly common complication, especially in a larger size tear. Such repair technique employing suture anchor devices alone has not yet produced functional results demonstrating both anatomical and biomechanical properties. Therefore, tendon tissue engineering using a combination of scaffolds, cells, and growth factors stimulation offers a potential solution as a biological augmentation in tendon repair.\n\nHuman amniotic membrane (HAM) has been widely used as a natural scaffold in tissue engineering due to many of its unique properties such as providing growth factors, cytokines and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, adequate mechanical strength, and biocompatibility. Whereas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) constitute one of the adult stem cells that promote replacement and repair of damaged tissue along with normal tissue turnover. These MSCs are seeded to the HAM scaffolds to biologically augment tendon repair, with MSCs acting as cytokines/growth factors to stimulate tissue repair. This approach serves as the foundation to conduct the present study. The investigators aim to investigate the efficacy of using allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs and human amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM) composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation."

The allogeneic IMP allo-APZ2-ACLF contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.\n\nThe clinical trial will be conducted in Germany and will consist of a screening, treatment and efficacy follow-up period, and a safety follow-up period.The total duration is planned to be about 3 years including the follow-up period.\n\nThe planned sample size is up to 18 treated patients. 2 x 10e6 cells/kg, each at Day 0, Day 5 (\u00b11) and Day 13 (\u00b11), will be administrated into peripheral vein (arm) by use of a perfusor. allo-APZ2-ACLF will be in a concentration of 1 x 10e7 cells/mL in HRG-solution. In patients which require dialysis, the IMP application has to be performed at least 3 hours after end of dialysis. This is necessary to ensure that cells and secreted molecules are not cleared from the system by the dialysis.\n\nPatients will be followed up for 24 weeks with clinic visits at Weeks 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 after IMP application. Further safety follow-ups will be scheduled as home interviews via telephone at Months 15 and 24. If necessary (at the discretion of the investigator), safety follow-ups at Months 15 and 24 can also be carried out as an on-site visit.\n\nThe first six patients will be enrolled into the clinical trial consecutively with an interval of 2 weeks between the third IMP-application of the first patient and the enrolment of the second patient, etc. During this period the patient receives all three applications and immediate severe adverse effects (allergic reactions, SIRS) that could occur after treatment would be reported before treatment start of the next patient.\n\nThe safety data of these first six patients will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor continuously, if required with assistance of the further members of the DSMB. The safety evaluation of the DSMB will be submitted to the PEI and recruitment can only be continued after approval of an amendment."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for several hematological disorders. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, aGVHDremains a common and life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Corticosteroids are still acted as the first-line treatments of aGVHD, with a response rate of 50-80. However, those who failed to initial therapy only have 10-30% long-term survival.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from many tissues, such as bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Such cells possess the capacity to suppress immunological responses, support hematopoiesis and repair tissues. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly for preventing and treating GVHD. Although the results are still controversy, most prospective and retrospective data suggest that MSCs are effective to aGVHD.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors combined with CD25 monoclonal antibody and calcineurin inhibitors in treating patients with aGVHD."

                              "Asthma affects one out of every 10 patients in the United States. Many of these patients have poor asthma symptom control. For example, patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma have ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite aggressive treatment with asthma medications. These patients are at increased risk for medication-related side effects and potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Novel therapies are critically needed for this population.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that reside in the bone marrow. MSCs are anti-inflammatory and also promote body tissue repair. This study will determine whether one form of MSCs called \"interferon gamma-primed MSCs or \u03b3MSCs\" are safe for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.\n\nPatients will receive a single intravenous infusion of \u03b3MSCs at either 2x10^6 cells/kg or 5x10^6 cells/kg. Up to 12 young adults will be enrolled. The total sample size will not exceed 24 participants.\n\nThe study will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (for patient activities) and at Emory University (for laboratory research activities). Participants will be identified from the asthma clinics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Participants will complete up to 12 visits over 1 year and will be compensated for their time and travel. At the completion of the study, any samples remaining after experimentation will be de-identified and made available for future research.\n\nWhile some study participants may receive no direct benefit from participating in this study, others may benefit from the close monitoring of their respiratory health, specialized asthma education, and general evaluation of their condition, including lung function tests. Some participants also achieve psychological benefit from participating in an important research study and from interaction with the study staff. It is also possible that the knowledge obtained from this study, such as identification of biomarkers, may assist in the creation of novel asthma therapies in the future."

                              "This is a Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety and efficacy of allogeneic (third party), bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the treatment of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 3. It will evaluate this by looking at whether there are treatment related infusion reactions, and assessing linear growth rates and bone health, both of which are impaired in patients ages 3-10 with Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 3. This is a single-site non-randomized clinical trial, that will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) at Egleston and Emory Children's Center.\n\nMSCs will be infused through IV every 4 months for 6 total infusions. There will be a baseline visit before MSC therapy is initiated, and there will be a follow up visits every 4 months for 1 year after the final MSC infusion. These infusions will take place in between pamidronate infusions (i.e. 2 months after the last pamidronate infusion, and 2 months before the next one). Pamidronate aids in treatment of bone pain and bone mineral density but does not correct the underlying defect nor does it show substantial improvements in linear growth.\n\nAfter the MSC infusions, patients will be provided an overnight at Ronald McDonald House, or a hospital affiliated hotel so they can be near to the hospital in case of any unanticipated effects, and for a follow up visit the next morning.\n\nLabs will be collected during every visit to look at bone metabolism. Limb and bone age x-rays, pQCT scans, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will be completed annually, while spine films will be completed every 18 months. These images will directly examine bone health. Body measurements will be taken every visit as well to assess linear growth. The patients' parents will complete events diaries and submit them each infusion day to evaluate fractures that occurred between visits. Patients and their parents will also complete quality of life surveys once a year.\n\nThere will be financial compensation for each study visit. Subjects will also be provided a free lunch on days when radiology visits occur and will be reimbursed for parking.\n\nSubjects will be identified and recruited mainly through Children's endocrinology clinic. There will also be advertisements to the OI foundation, and neighboring pediatric hospitals with OI programs such as University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt. If identified as eligible to participate, the study team will seek approval by the subjects' primary endocrinologist. The consent process will then take place in person during a baseline visit.\n\nThere is an optional part of the study that involves donation of a bone fragment that is taken out during a routine surgical rodding procedure. This piece of bone is removed and discarded, if it is not donated, making it minimal risk. Bone sample donation will be available to OI Type 3 subjects receiving MSCs, and to OI Type 3 subjects who are not receiving MSCs but want to participate in research.\n\nLeftover blood samples, and bone fragments may be stored for future research by the sponsor of this study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to help doctors and scientists learn if serial MSC infusions will safely and effectively aid in growth, bone health, and ultimately improve motoric function and quality of life in this population."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many hematologic diseases. However, about 5-27% of patients would suffer from poor graft function (PGF) and more recipients might develop delayed platelet engraftment (DPE) after allo-HSCT. These complications are associated with considerable mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF and DPE usually involves hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or second transplantation, but these methods have dismal effect or even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs might be effective in the treatment of PGF.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF or DPE is unsatisfactory in our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF or DPE after allo-HSCT."

                              "Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function. Today there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nExperimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and are found in all structural tissues of the body.\n\nIn the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.\n\nAmong the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017) that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial."

However, due to difficulty in consenting participants and operationalizing the protocol under the emergency environment of an acute STEMI, it became clear that a major protocol amendment would be required. Accordingly, the protocol was adjusted to randomize 105 participants (35 per treatment group) at 25 clinical study sites. This 53% reduction in participants from the original protocol allowed preliminary evaluations of safety and feasibility.\n\nPotential participants who were in the midst of experiencing an acute anterior wall STEMI, where increased time to coronary revascularization is known to correlate with the extent of subsequent myocardial necrosis, were approached by a study site investigator prior to PCI to determine the participant's interest to participate in a stem cell investigational trial. This required the patient to sign an informed consent permitting both the PCI procedure and participation in the trial. Participants who agreed to participate in the AMICI study and had a successful and uneventful PCI and stenting of the culprit LAD lesion performed were then randomized to one of the three treatment groups. The randomization and treatment assignment were obtained using an interactive voice-response system (IVRS/interactive web response system [IWRS]). The following stratification for duration of cardiac ischemia was performed to ensure balanced randomization across the treatment groups:\n\n\u22642 hours\n>2 hours to \u22646 hours\n>6 to \u226412 hours\n\nEligible participants received intracoronary delivery of the assigned treatment infused via a microcatheter into the stented culprit artery.\n\nAfter approximately 50% of the intracoronary infusion of investigational treatment was completed, an angiographic determination of coronary flow was performed. The following guidelines were used to determine if the remaining investigational agent should be infused:\n\nThe study infusion should have been continued if TIMI 2 or TIMI 3 flow was present in the absence of ALL of the following;\n\nSustained hypotension not responsive to fluid administration;\nClinical signs/symptoms indicating an acute cerebrovascular event;\nRe-elevation of ST-segments if previously resolved with PCI;\nOnset of the participant's symptoms of myocardial ischemia unresponsive to appropriate interventions;\nTwo episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) requiring cardioversion (infusion can continue if a single episode of sustained VT/VF requiring cardioversion occurred).\n\nFeasibility of the infusion of the investigational agent was assessed by measurement of TIMI flow and perfusion (1) immediately prior to, (2) during (after approximately 50% of total investigational agent volume infused) and (3) following the investigational agent infusion after successful PCI and stenting. There was no evidence of clinically important coronary microvascular obstruction related to infusion of the investigational agent.\n\nIf, for any reason, the site investigator withdrew a randomized participant prior to infusion of the investigational agent, the reason for early termination and data from the screening visit were entered into the eCRF by the study site. The participant did not remain in the study. If for any reason, a participant's study infusion was halted due to safety considerations, the participant remained in the study. A participant who prematurely withdrew from the study remained in the study for long-term safety follow-up.\n\nEvaluation for safety was performed for up to 24 months post infusion for all non-Swedish sites. Participants enrolled in Sweden who consented for additional follow-up underwent safety assessments at 36, 48, and 60 months post-infusion of investigational agent. All participants were to have cardiac imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [cMRI] and 2D-echocardiography, Holter monitoring, clinical evaluations, and laboratory testing as outlined in the study protocol.\n\nAn independent Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) reviewed all relevant acute peri-procedural data, serious adverse events (SAE), other adverse events (AE), and efficacy data (if requested) periodically until participant enrolment was closed."

To date, the incidence rate has been more than 3 million each year; however, as the increase and globalization of the environmental pollution has been expanded, the number of patients is expected to increase due to acute diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory virus, SARS, and coronavirus.\n\nSince 2015, Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends to use stem cells for product research on rare and intractable diseases including respiratory distress. Stem cells are also called pluripotent cells or truncal cells that can convert to any organ. It is an embryonic stage undifferentiated cell that has stopped differentiating before forming a specific organ whose differentiation has not been determined and has the ability to differentiate into muscle, bone, and internal conformal body organs. There are three types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells.

Baseline data will include physical examination of the knee, clinical assessment of knee pain and function using validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), radiographs, and MRI. Tissue from qualified donors will be used to establish allogeneic MSC banks (using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) based on standard operating procedures), which will be tested and released for clinical use. Patients will undergo surgical debridement of their cartilage defect with harvest of the articular cartilage surrounding the defect rim. Following rapid digestion into chondrocytes and their pericellular matrix, autologous chondrons will be mixed in a 1:4 ratio with allogeneic AMSCs obtained from AMSC banks and suspended in fibrin glue for application to the debrided osteochondral defect. All patients will be clinically evaluated at 1-2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, 18 moths, and 24 months post-RECLAIM for adverse events (AEs).

                              "Sexual functional deficiency occurs at some point in life and becomes a problematic issue in middle-aged adulthood. Regenerative medicine, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation, has developed extensively, with preclinical and clinical trials emphasizing the benefits of stem cell therapy for restoration of sexual deficiency. n our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency. In phase II, 40 males with hormone deficiency will be recruited and divided randomly into two groups (n=23 each). The group A will receive UC-MSCs intravenously at day 0 and day 90 \u00b1 7, while the group B will be infused with UC-MSCs at day 180 \u00b1 14 and day 270 \u00b1 14. Each group will be monitored for 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion. The phase II is to investigate safety and efficacy of UC-MSC infusion for the treatment of sexual hormone deficiency in males.\n\nThe primary outcome are: (1) numbers of AEs or SAEs during UC-MSC infusion and 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion; (2) Testosterone levels and sexual life quality through quantification of Aging Men Symptom (AMS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQoL-M) at day 90 \u00b1 7 and day 180 \u00b1 14 of the group A compared to those of the group B.\n\nThe secondary outcome are: (1) Testosterone levels and (2) sexual life quality through quantification of AMS, IIEF, and SQoL-M at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion of each group compared to the baseline; (3) cytokine concentration (TNFa, IFN-\u03b3, IL1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, IDO) in serum of the participants and their T cell immunophenotype at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion."

MSCs are cells that can help the body heal from injury and maintain a healthy immune system. MSCs have been used to prevent and treat a GvHD. In previous human studies, MSC infusion has been generally well-tolerated and safe, and in some cases, benefit was reported. The donor of the MSCs could be a relative or a stranger, and does not need to be the same individual who donated the stem cells for the stem cell transplant. All donors are screened for infectious diseases, similar to a blood donor. All donors have a physical exam.\n\nCorticosteroids may be administered with MSCs/ECP. Continued use of anti-infective medications, GVHD prophylaxis medications (including calcineurin inhibitors), transfusion support, and topical steroid therapy is permitted. Participants will be assessed for safety and tolerability using a continuous monitoring approach. In order to be included in the tolerability review, participants must have received at least 1 treatment with MSCs."

                              "Pulmonary infection is a critical disease threatening human health. With the extensive use of antibiotics, the incidence of clinical drug resistance has been on the rise significantly in recent years. Once drug resistance occurs, we will see a high mortality rate due to scarce therapies and a poor prognosis. It is almost impossible to surmount the severe pulmonary infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria only by upgrading antibiotics. The commonly used supportive therapies clinically, such as glucocorticoids and immunomodulators, also lack forceful medical evidence. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new treatments.\n\nMesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.\n\nMesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.\n\nCurrently, it has been confirmed that stem cells can visibly improve the pathological changes of lungs caused by infection, lighten pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, mitigate alveolar inflammation, and remove bacteria. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of pulmonary infection caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nPatients were treated, in the research project, with well-suited noninvasive haMPC-Exos aerosol inhalation, in an attempt to verify the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment with pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems."

With wide use of HLA-mismatch, unrelated and cord blood donors as alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as the standard prophylaxis of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in HLA-mismatch and unrelated donor transplantation, allo-HSCT recipients are at increasing risk for viral infections.\n\nTill now, CMV remains one of the most important viruses and causes of death in the recipients of allo-HSCT. Approximately 75% of CMV-seropositive recipients develop CMV reactivation, and 20-30% of these patients develop CMV disease without intervention. Ganciclovir is the first-line treatment of CMV diseases. However, bone marrow suppression, which is the main and common side effect, limits the utility of ganciclovir in allo-HSCT recipients. Besides, ganciclovir and other antiviral agents resistance has been reported up to 28%. Since it has been known that specific immune response to CMV is important to control reactivation, CMV-specific CTL has been used in prophylaxis and treatment of CMV viremia in several studies. However, the production of CTL requires time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. In vivo experiment showed that MSCs have antimicrobial activity.\n\nIn this trial, we will use MSCs in the recipients with refractory CMV infections."

                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death from COVID-19. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the storm of cytokines and chemokines, which cause uncontrolled fatal systemic inflammation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells that express the angiotensin II converting enzyme receptor (ACE2). This receptor is widely distributed on the surface of type II alveolar cells (AT2) and on the capillary endothelium. This is why the cytokine storm will trigger a violent attack by the immune system on the body, cause ARDS and multiple organ failure, and can ultimately lead to death. Mortality in cases of severe SIRA caused by COVID 19 varies significantly between 50 and 90%, basically depending on the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nThe plasticity of Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) regulates inflammation and immunity. MSC can promote and inhibit an immune response, depending on the dynamics of inflammation and depending on the activation force of the immune system, the types of inflammatory cytokines present, and the effects of immunosuppressants. Essentially, the state of inflammation determines the immunoregulatory fate of MSC. Thus, IV application of MSC has been shown to control the inflammatory response in various diseases, such as the graft-versus-host reaction and the ARDS caused by H5NI.\n\nMSC are negative for ACE2, therefore they have been used to decrease the cytokine storm present in COVID-19.\n\nTwo recent studies in China have used human allogeneic MSC to treat COVID-19 pneumonia. Both studies reveal a marked reversal of symptoms, even in critically serious cases. Lung function improved two days after MSC application and 10 days later they were discharged. Lymphocytes increased, PCR decreased, and cytokine-producing immune cells disappeared within 3 to 6 days. Regulatory immune cells increased. TNF alpha factor decreased and IL10 increased.\n\nTaking into account the previous concepts together with the current global pandemic, and the high mortality existing among patients with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe ARDS, the investigators propose intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells from bank laboratory, with the purpose partially proven to decrease the systemic inflammatory process, offering it as a salvage treatment.\n\nFive patients, of either sex, over 18 years of age, with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe ARDS that has not improved in relation to the following parameters: a) Persistent PaO2 / FiO2 less than 150, b) persistent fever, c ) D-dimer increase of at least 50% of baseline and / or ferritin greater than 1000, after 48 h of hospital stay receiving the standard management measures used at that time in the care center, will be included in the study. Covid pneumonia should be confirmed by chest CT and RNA detection by positive SARS-Cov2 PCR. This treatment will be administered after discussing it with the relatives that it is a procedure considered as rescue and will be carried out with informed consent.\n\nTheir follow-up will be daily while they are hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and / or hospitalized, until their discharge from the hospital or until the third week after surgery. If the patient has already been discharged from the hospital, his last evaluation will be in the third week.\n\nThe main objective of this protocol is: To describe the clinical changes secondary to IV administration of MSC, in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, with the evaluation of the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as of the fever curve daily.\n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n\na) To assess the effect of the proposed treatment on the general biochemical indicators (Leukocytes, absolute lymphocytes, absolute neutrophils, absolute monocytes, absolute eosinophils, absolute basophils, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, total bilirubin, albumin, amino-aspartate transferase, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, glomerular filtration, myoglobin, troponin, ferritin and D-dimer. Daily.\n\nb. To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the proposed treatment with assessment of the levels of cytokines, and C-reactive protein, TNFa, IL10, IL1, IL6, IL17, VEGF in plasma. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\nc. Assess the radiological evolution of the proposed treatment through simple chest CT. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\nd. Evaluate immune system improvement with mass cytometry to analyze patients' immune cells: regulatory T cells (CXCR3-), dendritic cells (DC, CXCR3-), CXCR3 + CD4 + T, CXCR3 + CD + T, and CXCRT3 + NK. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\ne) Assess the safety of the proposed treatment (allergic reactions and / or infection) F. To assess the negativization of the RNA detection test by SARS-Cov2 PCR. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\nThe inclusion criteria are:\n\nComply with the informed consent procedure and sign the informed consent form.\nOver 18 years\nOf any gender\nWith SARS-Cov2 PCR RNA detection test, positive\nWith bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19\nSevere ARDS with PaO2 / FiO2 less than 150\nThat it has not improved in relation to: a) Persistent PaO2 / FiO2 less than 150, b) persistent fever, c) increase in D-dimer at least 50% of the baseline and / or ferritin greater than 1000, after 48 hrs hospital stay receiving the standard management measures used at that time in the care center.\nLymphopenia less than 800 total lymphocytes\nIncreased D-dimer (> 1200 mg / dl)\nCT compatible with bilateral pneumonia\nSOFA under 11 With knowledge of the patient and / or their responsible relatives that it is a rescue treatment, in an experimental phase.\n\nThe bank mesenchymal cells will be donated by the CBCells Bio Technology Laboratory, at no cost to the patient or INCMNSZ.\n\n1x106 x Kg of weight, diluted in 100 ml of saline, will be infused intravenously, to pass in 40 minutes. It will be monitored with monitors, Pao2 / Fio2, FC, FR, ECG. Additionally, fever and muscle contractures will be monitored, which will be recorded every hour for 24 hours and every 24 hours thereafter, up to three weeks after the application of MSC. The patient should continue with their indicated medical treatments, such as antibiotics and specific treatments in case of comorbidities.\n\nThe results will be compared with the historical controls attended at INCMNSZ Thus, the results obtained will give information to calculate the sample size in subsequent studies in which the usefulness of the procedure will be evaluated."

                              "Liver cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands and causes by many forms of liver diseases and conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. Liver cirrhosis has become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality with over one million people died due to cirrhosis in 2010 worldwide. Currently, the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. However, the shortage in donor organ availability and the side-effect associated with long-term immunosuppression after transplant requires the development of new alternative therapies for liver cirrhosis. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) as well as umbilical cord-derive mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. In Vietnam, however, there are no clinical trials to date that investigate the potential of UC-MSCs for liver cirrhosis management. This is a phase I, open label, single arm trial using UC-MSCs to treat patients with liver cirrhosis that includes 20 patients. The primary outcome measure will be change in MELD score at 3, 6, and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation from baseline. The safety is assessed by frequency and severity of the adverse event or serious adverse event associated with stem cell injection. This study could reconfirm the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis and would open a novel cell therapy for the treatment of adult liver cirrhosis"

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease and often leads to lifelong disability, muscle spasm, sensory deficits, autonomic disturbances, as well as bowel and bladder incontinence, all of which can cause tremendous troubles to patients but are lack of any effective treatment up to now. SCI is not only a severe healthy problem but also a great social burden. To the best of our knowledge, cell therapy seems to be a promising alternative for the treatment of SCI due to numerous advantages. However, cytotherapy is still in its infancy since there are many disparities and uncertainties regarding subject selection, cellular type, transplantation timing, administration dose and deliver route in clinical trial protocols. Hence, a standardized well-designed clinical study is urgently required for the safe and effective treatment of SCI.\n\nIn this study, complete or incomplete cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar SCI subjects were recruited to join in a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial. Intervention is four times of subarachnoid administration of allogeneic hUC-MSCs. During the intervention and follow-up periods of this trial, any adverse event was identified rapidly and managed properly. The maximum intensity and relationship of any adverse event with hUC-MSCs administration were identified.The primary efficacy indicator is American spinal injury association (ASIA) total score at the fourth follow-up and SCI Functional Rating Scale of the International Association of Neurorestoratology (IANR-SCIFRS) total score at the fourth follow-up. Secondary efficacy indicators are these two indicators at the remaining time points, scores of pin prick, light touch, motor and sphincter, muscle spasticity and spasm, autonomic system, bladder and bowel functions, residual urine volume. Subgroup analysis of primary efficacy indicators was also performed.\n\nIn this trial, informed consent forms that had the approval of the institutional review board were obtained from all participants before recruitment. In this clinical study, subarachnoid transplantation of hUC-MSCs was performed a total of four times per subject with the delivery dose of 1\u00d710E6 cells/kg. After the completion of cytotherapy, subject was regularly followed up in the hospital at four time points, determined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the final administration of hUC-MSCs. At each time point of administration (the first, second, third, and fourth transplantation) and follow-up (the first, second, third, and fourth follow-up), safety and efficacy indicators were collected accordingly by two independent assessors."

                              "Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty. Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July 2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies"

                              "Background:\n\nXerostomia is the diagnosis of the subjective feeling of dry mouth. Xerostomia can coexist with or exist without a reduced production of saliva, although xerostomia is first perceived when unstimulated whole saliva flow rate is reduced by more than 40-50%. In this context, a subnormal or pathologically reduced saliva production (hyposalivation) will severely diminish the quality of life and lead to severe dental decay. The two main causes of grave xerostomia are Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Radiation therapy plays a central role in the curative treatment of most upper head and neck cancers, either as a single modality or in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery, and the prevalence of xerostomia after head and neck radiation ranges from 74 to 85%.\n\nRadiation therapy increases local tumor control significantly along with the chance of survival, but despite the more advanced methods of radiation therapy, Intensity-Modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a significant proportion of the radiation is deposited in the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. The decrease of saliva secretion after radiation therapy predisposes the patients to a variety of conditions. These are either directly or indirectly a result of the decreased production of saliva and include xerostomia, impairment of the normal oral functions (talking, chewing, and swallowing) due to insufficient wetting, and reduced lubrication of mucosal surfaces and the ingested food which impairs nutrition. Furthermore, the oral mucosa can become dry, making the oral mucosa vulnerable, which may lead to frictional trauma and ulceration. In addition, a reduced salivary flow results in a reduced \"rinsing\" of the entire oral cavity, thus leading to microbial overgrowth, which in addition to other factors may result in rapid dental decay, dental erosion, and oral candidiasis (thrush).\n\nStem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types. For more than ten years, researchers have investigated the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage and several groups have addressed the use of MSCs or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in preclinical studies of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.\n\nThe research group has completed an encouraging randomized-controlled pilot study (MESRIX-I) with 30 patients assessing the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded autologous ASCs for radiation-induced xerostomia in an effort to regenerate the function of the salivary glands (EudraCT nb:2014-004349-29). The results of this study show most importantly that the treatment is safe without any serious adverse events (SAE) and no systemic reactions, and secondly, the patients treated with stem cells have a promising enhanced production of saliva of 33%-50%. Furthermore, the research group has shown that the stem cell group gained vital quality of life measures compared with the placebo group in the form of diminished trouble in eating.\n\nThe research group has furthermore recently investigated the safety of allogenic ASCs for the treatment of xerostomia (MESRIX-II) with a clinical safety and feasible trial (EudraCT nb: 2018-003856-19). The study included ten patients who received intraglandular injections of allogeneic ASCs. No serious treatment-related adverse reaction occurred, and the efficacy data was similar to the results from our first trial with autologous ASCs.\n\nResearch hypothesis Treatment with ASCs will result in an improvement of the participant's unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rate and ameliorate the xerostomia and increase quality of life.\n\nStudy aim The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.\n\nStudy design The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ASCs as a treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia for previous head and neck cancer patients.\n\nMethod Patients between the age of 18-70 years previously treated with radiation for a head and neck cancer and a clinically evaluated reduced salivation and hyposalivation, evaluated by a screening, can be included. Each participant will be double-blindly randomized to receive either allogeneic ASCs or placebo consisting of CryoStor10 (BiolifeSolutions), the freeze media for ASCs containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Allogeneic ASCs are provided from the Cardiology Stem Cell Centre (CSCC) at Rigshospitalet.\n\nPatients will be evaluated on salivary gland function and saliva flow rate by sialometry. Both unstimulated whole saliva and stimulated whole saliva will be collected. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the following on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by ionic balance estimation, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride, total protein and selected proteins, and amylase. For evaluation of the participants\u00b4 perception of xerostomia, the participants will answer validated questionnaires in Danish (EORTC QLQ Module for H&N-35 and XQ) at baseline and after four months. These patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires are essential, validated tools for estimating the degree of quality of life (QoL) and xerostomia.\n\nRecruitment of MESRIX-III participants and obtaining informed consent MESRIX-III participants (recipients/placebo) will be recruited through the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Rigshospitalet and Oncology Departments at Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital, and through our databases on head and neck cancer patients. The investigator will send a letter to eligible patients who have been treated and followed for their previous cancer disease. Eligible patients can also contact the investigators or a trained member of the MESRIX-III study by phone or by a specific study e-mail (regionh-stamcelle.rigshospitalet@regionh.dk) if the eligible patients wish to receive a letter with further information. Subsequently, the principal investigator or a trained member of the MESRIX-III study group will contact patients by phone and inquire about their interest in participating in the research project.\n\nIf the eligible patients have an interest in participating in the project, the eligible patients will be invited to an interview at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Rigshospitalet for further information concerning the trial. In the written information material, besides material about the trial, the pamphlets \"Rights of test subjects in a health scientific research project\" and \"before decision\" will be included. The right to bring counsel to the information interview will likewise be explained. Motivated patients referred from doctors in other parts of Denmark and patients who approach our department with an interest in participation in the stem cell research will also be offered information about the trial. Patients from all parts of Denmark can be included if the participants pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria described below. However, transportation and accommodation cannot be provided.\n\nThe information interview will take place in an undisturbed environment with the principal investigator or trained member of the MESRIX-III study group, who has the professional qualifications to communicate the content of the research project, and who will clearly explain that it is a request to participate in a health science research project. The participant will be given oral information about the project in layman's terms on the basis of the written information, and any questions will be answered. The oral information will be adapted to the participant's requirements, and it will be explained without the use of technical terms. Participants will be informed of the right to reflection following the information interview. Participants will likewise be informed of the opportunity to get feedback on the scientific results but will also be informed that no new information on the individual participant's disease or prognosis will be obtained. The potential participants for MESRIX-III will be contacted by telephone by the responsible physician for final commitment to participate. If participants are still interested in participating in the project, an appointment is made where a medical history is taken, and where the remaining trial appointments will be planned in agreement with the participant, and here the participants and the responsible physician will sign the medical consent form.\n\nEvaluation, reporting, and recording of adverse events All adverse events (AEs) are monitored and recorded along with concomitant medicine at the scheduled follow-up (day one, and 4 months after the intervention). AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the clinical trial participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment (ASC/placebo). AEs will be assessed and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 guidelines (CTCAEv5.0). Thus, all adverse events are recorded with CTCAE grade. All grade 3 and grade 4 events and incidents considered related to this trial will be reported to the sponsor by the investigator immediately after the events are discovered.\n\nAn adverse reaction (AR) is defined as any untoward or unintended response in a participant to an investigational medical product (IMP) which is related to any dose administered to that subject.\n\nAn adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is stated as all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADR.\n\nSerious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR), or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), means any AE, AE, SUSAR, respectively, that:\n\nResults in death or\n\nA serious deterioration in health that\n\nResulted in life-threatening illness or injury\nRequired hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nResulted in permanent impairment of body structure or body function\nResulted in medical or surgical treatment to prevent the above\nLead to foetal death, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other negative effect on the foetus\nAnything the Principal Investigator deems to be of Clinical serious significance\n\nMedical judgment will be exercised by the primary investigator together with the sponsor whether an AE or AR should be classified as serious in other situations.\n\nThe included participants will be instructed to contact the principal investigator or a special trained person from the research group in case of events with possible relation to the trial treatment within the main study period.\n\nThe principal investigator will immediately (within maximum 24 hours after receiving the information) inform the sponsor if SAR, SAE or serious suspected adverse reactions occurs. The sponsor will report SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) to the Danish Medicines Agency and the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics within 15 days of occurrence and 7 days in case of death or life-threatening issue. Unexpected reactions are defined as reactions that are not described in the section \"Reference Safety information\" of this protocol. All other unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported within 15 days after the sponsor becomes aware of these.\n\nAll SARs that have occurred during the trial will be reported to The Danish Medicines Agency, The Danish Patient Safety Authority, and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (if appropriate) once a year by the sponsor.\n\nThe sponsor will annually send a concise review and evaluation of pertinent safety information, a Development Safety update report (DSUR) collected during the reporting period related to the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA).\n\nAfter completion of the trial, the sponsor will after 90 days inform the Danish Medicines Agency that the study is completed. Within a year, the sponsor will submit trial results to the board, according to the law on drugs (Lov om l\u00e6gemidler) \u00a7 89. 2, No. 4\n\nReference safety information (RSI) Adverse events with possible relation to injection of ASCs: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious\n\nAdverse events with relation to similar procedures and in MESRIX-I: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%; Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%; Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%; Not serious Infection of the salivary gland; 0.5-5%; Not serious Bleeding/hematoma in the salivary gland; 1-5%; Not serious\n\nThe above numbers and AEs are based on the previous phase I-II trial (EudraCT: 2014-004349-29) and on the literature cited and described in the section \"Risk Assessment\". In the previous study by the research group, MESRIX-I, with autologous ASCs no SAR or SUSARs were detected, so any SAR in this study will be reported as a SUSAR.\n\nLong-term safety and efficacy follow-up Following Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) under EMEA draft from January 2018 on safety and efficacy (S&E) follow-up and risk management of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), the MESRIX-III participants will be invited to a follow-up of efficacy and ARs one year after the intervention (ASCs/placebo). Longer follow-up is not needed based on the reported long-term safety described in the section.\n\n\"Risk Assessment\". Follow-up will include basic ear, nose, and throat examination, fiberscope, ultrasound of submandibular glands, sialometry, and blood samples. Data from the electronic medical journals and national pathology database will be gathered. It is expected that a number of the participants will have a recurrence of their primary cancer during the study or follow-up period due to the nature of the head and neck cancer. The allogeneic MSCs are believed to be rejected in the recipients, and the stem cells are adult non-pluripotent. However, in case of recurrence of cancer or new primary cancer developments each case will be carefully evaluated and potentially investigated with genetic analysis in an attempt to distinguish whether a tumor is due to recurrence, the administered product, or endogenous tumor formation.\n\nSample size and power considerations From MESRIX-I it appeared to be realistic to increase saliva production for whole unstimulated salivary flow (in milliliter(ml)/minut) rate by about 33% or in absolute numbers from 0.125 to 0.151 after 1 month and 0.155 after 4 months. The power calculation is based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. This means that the total number of patients included would have to be 100 (50 in each group) for a paired t-test. 10-20 additional participants may be included to compensate for dropout during the study period. The investigators believe that a 33% increase in whole, unstimulated salivary flow rate is clinically important and also realistic to detect.\n\nEthical considerations The trial is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration. The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency (DPA) will be requested permission to conduct the study. Moreover, the Danish Medicines Agency will be requested approval, and the trial will be monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit (Birgitte Gr\u00f8n). Each volunteer (MESRIX-III participants) is required to give written informed consent before he/she can be included in the study. Information obtained about participants' health, other purely private matters, and other confidential information is covered by professional secrecy. No project participant has a personal financial incentive to implement the described project. The samples will be analyzed and stored in Denmark.\n\nRisk assessment When the study participants in MESRIX-III will receive either ASCs or placebo into the large salivary glands the risk of adverse events such as infection and bleeding is estimated to be below 0.5% when using similar procedures. In our previous studies, none of the 40 participants developed adverse reactions.\n\nThe MESRIX-III participants may also experience some pain briefly during injection of the transplant product (ASCs or placebo).\n\nA theoretical risk of a possible carcinogenic effect in the treatment of MSC/ASCs has been discussed. This is due to their production of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), a factor produced by the MSC/ASCs. These considerations are particularly relevant since ASCs are used in participants previously diagnosed with cancer. However, in model systems of cancer, the effect of MSCs on cancer growth is controversial as MSCs have both been shown to be inhibitory and stimulatory. Further, numerous clinical trials with more than 1000 participants have been conducted with MSCs in different participant populations, and no increase in the incidence of cancer has been detected. These studies include local injection of MSCs. With respect to the use of ex vivo expanded MSCs, despite extensive research, there is no data indicating malignant transformation of expanded human MSCs/ASCs.\n\nData collection Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report Form (CRF).\n\nThe study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring, audit, and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA for the processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation. Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet.\n\nData will be analyzed with R. Our data will be kept securely in the electronic data capture system (EDC) Redcap. All data will be directly entered. The trial will be completed when all data is collected.\n\nAll results will be stored and analyzed electronically; participants' anonymity is ensured in accordance with the national data legislation. After completion of the study, data will be stored in an anonymous form. Data containing social security numbers will be kept locked and inaccessible to unauthorized persons.\n\nSubject confidentially The investigator is obliged to ensure that participant anonymity is protected and maintained. On the CRF\u00b4s subjects should be identified by their initials and a subject study number only, Documents that are not for submission (e.g., signed informed consent forms) will be kept in strict confidence by the principal investigator. In compliance with the GCP Guidelines, it is required that the investigator and the institution permit authorized representatives of a monitoring company direct access to reviewing subjects' original medical records for verification of study-related procedures and data. All information obtained concerning this protocol regarding participants is protected according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)."

                              "Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nAlthough human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use.\n\nThe purpose of this study, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency as well as provide a clinical dose reference for the subsequent trails of aerosol inhalation of MSCs-Exo in the treatment of severe lung diseases (including severe lung infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc.)"

Chondral defects or damages to articular cartilages due to accidents, necrosis of subchondral bone tissue, or arthritis have become some of the more common disorders today. About 15% of the world's population is reportedly suffering from cartilage and joint damages such as degenerative arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. As population aging progresses and as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of the target patient group is also growing. However, despite ongoing research, an effective treatment for cartilage defects is yet to be discovered. Various different types of treatments are currently in use, such as drug therapy, arthroscopy, and artificial joint surgery. However, they all fail to address the root cause. Complete treatment, or regeneration of damaged or defective cartilage is impossible and continuous drug administration or secondary surgeries are required in many cases.\n\nAs a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized damage to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few life science companies both home and abroad are marketing this method of treatment called 'autologous chondrocyte transplant'. The treatment involves the extraction of healthy cartilage tissue from the patient which is then cultured and transplanted into the damaged site.\n\nHowever, this treatment requires the extraction of chondrocytes directly from the patient and thus causes trauma in healthy articular cartilage. Also, this type of treatment cannot be applied to large lesions, nor is the efficacy satisfactory in patients over the age of 40 whose cellular activation levels are low. Thus, autologous chondrocyte transplant is rather limited in the number of cells harvested and their activation level and is therefore restricted in terms of treatment site, severity of the condition, and the size of lesion. The current technology allows the application of treatments in local cartilage defects but not in degenerative arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The technology needs to be taken up to another level in order to benefit such prevalent arthritic disorders. Treatments using stem cells do not cause damage to healthy articular cartilage as they don't require the harvesting of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients. Moreover, the number of successfully cultured cells is larger due to the excellent proliferation capability of stem cells and thus, mass supply is possible.\n\nThis clinical trial for the stem cell therapies is essential because treatment of cartilage defects with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, known to have the highest level of activity among all adult stem cells, opens the possibility of articular cartilage regeneration even for aged patients and patients with large lesions unable to benefit from existing treatments.\n\nThe biggest challenge faced by nations competing in the field of \"tissue differentiation and regeneration using stem cells\" is the question of whether or not the use of embryonic stem cells is ethical. Chondrogenesis using umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells can not only avoid similar challenges, but also present an innovative treatment mode with significant clinical implications for the patients.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured, mixed with semi- solid polymer, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery in order to stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

                              "This is a 50 patient, Phase 1/2a multi-center pilot study to test the safety and to describe the preliminary efficacy of intravenous administration of allogenic human cord tissue mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT- MSC) as an investigational agent, under U.S. INDs 19968 (Duke) and 19937 (U Miami) to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection (COVID-ARDS). Patients will be eligible for treatment with 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC at 1 million cells/kg (max dose 100 million cells) in the phase 1 portion of the study or a fixed dose of 100 million cells daily x 3 days, 12-36 hours apart in the phase 2 portion of the study, if they have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS. The primary endpoint is short-term safety of hCT-MSC infusions given on this schedule. The key secondary endpoints are 28 day survival, an increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio by 50% at 96 hours, days to hospital discharge to home or rehab, and number of days requiring mechanical or non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula.\n\nThe study will be executed in two phases. The first 10 consecutive patients will all receive investigational product. The second part of the study is a randomized, controlled trial in 40 additional patients. The overall aim of the study is to establish safety and to gain critical information as to whether patients with COVID-ARDS will benefit from MSC infusions. Results from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the medical literature. Results from the additional 40 patients will be analyzed as a randomized placebo control trial. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study.\n\nThe MSCs are manufactured from allogeneic cord tissue donated to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank (CCBB) at Duke University. The CCBB is an FDA licensed public cord blood bank (licensed name DUCORD). Cord tissue is donated by mothers delivering healthy term male babies by Cesarean section, after written informed consent from the newborn infant's mother. Full donor screening and testing is performed in accordance with regulatory requirements (21CFR 1271). The hCT-MSCs will be manufactured in the Marcus Center for Cellular Cures in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and the Clinical Research Cell Manufacturing Program (CRCMP) laboratory, Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute (ISCI), Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami. These hCT-MSCs are already being utilized in clinical trials to treat pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder (IND 17313), cerebral palsy (IND 17921), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (IND 17313) and adults with osteoarthritis of the knee (IND18414). To date, over 210 doses of cells have been delivered to patients on these clinical trials with an excellent safety profile. At University of Miami, hCT-MSCs are used in the clinical trial to evaluate cytokine suppression in patients with chronic inflammation due to metabolic syndrome (IND 17324), 12 subjects in the pilot phase of the study had completed the dose without any treatment emergence SAE.\n\nThe rationale for using this approach for patients infected with COVID-19 is that ARDS, the rate-limiting complication impacting survival, is caused, at least in part, by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which results is severe immune dysregulation. Involved cytokines include IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, THP-1M, TNF-alpha, and others. MSCs have strong anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities without apparent toxicity or further immunosuppression. Approximately 3-5 % of patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS which carries a very high mortality rate (30-60%) due to multi-system organ failure. Effective treatment of ARDS, the most feared complication of COVID-19, may convert the COVID-19 pandemic into a more manageable \"flu-like\" illness that every American is expected to experience, and most will survive, on an annual basis."

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI), damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves, often causes permanent neurofunction deficit, including strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of injury. WHO reported 15-40/million people suffer from SCI each year, about 250,000 to 500,000 people. The majority of SCI victims are young patients, who are at the time of working age. As a result of that, SCI not only affects the physical and psychological health of those patients, but also bring huge economic burden to their families, as well as the society. The current treatments for SCI mainly include surgical operation, neuroregenerative medicine, physical therapy, chinese acupuncture and so on. However, none of these methods are efficient enough to make any functional recovery of neurological injury in patients, and most patients will have to face paraplegia or tetraplegia.\n\nThe most challenge of SCI treatment are reported to be regeneration of axon and rewiring of the damaged spinal cord. The properties of strong proliferation and differentiation make stem cell transplantation possible to replace the damage axon and rebridge the injury spinal cord. Currently, evidences from animal experiments and pilot clinical studies have reported that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation was a potential method to treat spinal cord injury, but its safety and efficacy remain controversial.\n\nThis study will conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of different phrases of SCI, including sub-acute, early stage, and late stage of chronic SCI. These three trials will investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal transplantation of UC-MSC in patients with SCI treatment. The study will be conducted at 3 hospitals in China, covering eastern, southern and western of Chinese mainland.\n\nThe primary outcome is the changes of motor and sensory assessment before and after intervention using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Score Scale. Secondary outcomes will include International Association of Neural Restoration Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIRFS), electromyogram test, residual urine test and adverse events.\n\nThe enrolled participants will be followed up at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation. Besides, the samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected, before and after treatment, to explore the potential mechanism of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of SCI.\n\nThe results of this study will, for the first time, provide high level of evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

The umbilical cord is one of the important sources of MSC. Human UC-MSC compared with the bone marrow-derived MSC has the following advantages: (1) the umbilical cord, as a \"waste\" after giving birth can be obtained without any harm to the donor. (2) easy available, and no ethical issues. (3) its likelihood of contamination is small because of the protection of the placental barrier. (4) human UC-MSC has a stronger amplification capacity, a shorter doubling time, a higher colony forming efficiency and lower immunogenicity. (5) which avoids the activity and differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSC latent with the donor disadvantage of increasing age decreased.\n\nhuman UC-MSC not only for hematopoietic stem cell graft implantation and amplification has a role in promoting and exhibit immunomodulatory effects and characteristics of damaged or targeted sites of chronic inflammation. human UC-MSC in the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced organ transplantation immune tolerance and other fields has broad application prospects.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of exploration, the investigators and other practitioners caught studies found that the umbilical cord is more suitable as mesenchymal stem cells seed cells relative to the bone marrow, umbilical cord easily obtained, no ethical issues, better amplification ability in vitro, viral contamination risk is small, and many other advantages. Therefore, over the years, the investigator team for the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in a lot of the basic work has been confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells derived from the umbilical cord had safety and effectiveness in in the treatment of acute graft versus host disease in zoology test, and successfully establish a perfect umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in standard operating procedures (including screening umbilical cord, large-scale preparation, quality inspection, preservation, recovery, transportation, infusion, etc.). The investigators will carry out the clinical research based on above preliminary results."

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year."

                              "Traditionally, RA has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and non-biologics-DMARDs. Only non-biologics-DMARDs and, at a lesser extent, glucocorticoids have shown to be able to prevent or interrupt the inflammatory and destructive disease processes.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic stromal cells that are able to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, and adipose. MSCs can be easily isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue and rapidly expanded in culture. MSCs have also been shown to have immuno-suppressive and healing capacities, improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties could be used for novel therapeutic applications in various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), genetic bone and cartilage disorders and bone metastasis. MSCs can potently modulate immune responses, showing antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory capacities.\n\nThis study is a multicenter phase Ib/IIa, escalating dose, single blind clinical trial to assess the safety of the intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) to refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerance, and to identify, if possible, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose for future clinical trials on efficacy of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs for patients suffering rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under treatment with at least one non-biologic-Disease modifying antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) who have previously failed to treatment with at least two biologics. The secondary objective is to obtain information on the clinical and functional effects of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs in patients with RA and to explore pharmacodynamics parameters.\n\n53 patients (i.e. patients having received at least one dose of study treatment) in three different cohorts are planned to be included in this clinical trial. Expansion will start after acute toxicity assessment of the first three patients of each cohort.\n\nDose and intervals for the trial consist of the following active groups: a) first cohort: 1 million cells/kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; b) second cohort: 2 million cells / kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; c) third cohort: 4 million cells / kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15."

                              "For numerous malignant and non-malignant hematological diseases allogeneic hemato\u00acpoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy. One of the major complications is the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). Thirty to eighty percent of patients after HSCT develop aGVHD despite the prophylactic application of different immunosuppressive drugs depending on risk factors such as HLA-match, donor relation, age etc.1-3.\n\nFirst line therapy of aGVHD > grade I consists of steroids at a dose of 2 mg/kg. The response rates to this treatment are only 15-35%4. In case of a steroid refractory aGVHD different therapeutic strategies have been evaluated, but with no satisfactory results so far. The mortality of patients suffering from steroid refractory aGVHD remains at 75-80%, although numerous studies with different treatment strategies have been conducted2-5. Therefore, it remains important to search for new therapeutical strategies for the treatment of aGVHD.\n\nThe first patient to receive mismatched Mesenchymal Stem Cells was a twenty-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia treated with peripheral blood stem cells combined with MSC from her haploidentical father. Lazarus et al. reported on 46 patients who received HSCs and culture-expanded MSCs from HLA-identical siblings. Moderate to severe acute GvHD was observed in 28% of the patients, and chronic GvHD was seen in 61%. The two-year progression-free survival was observed in 53% of the patients. MSC infusion caused no acute or long-term MSC-associated adverse events.\n\nTraditionally, for MSC isolation and expansion, fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented media are used. The use of FCS has however several drawbacks and potential problems. We have therefore established a MSC culture protocol in animal serum free conditions using human platelet lysate and human plasma instead.\n\nThe present phase I/II study is designed to gather further insight into the clinical benefit in 50 patients (adults and children) with GvHD exerted by MSC expanded with human platelet lysate and plasma"

Subject with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease will be treated with Cx601, suspension of eASCs, at a dose of 120 million cells administered by intralesional injection. The treatment of complex perianal fistulas by local application of eASCs intends to improve significantly the local conditions with very few inconveniences (ambulatory procedure) and minimal risk of possible complications (anal incontinence). Therefore, this is a new therapeutic resource that is expected to be safe and efficacious as well as is expected to improve the quality of life of the patients in this highly debilitating and chronic condition. This treatment would prevent one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would diminish recurrence of the fistula disease and would reduce drastically the significant disorders provoked by the standard fistula surgery in the patients. Indeed, patients can be discharged according to the \"One Day Surgical\" procedures (major ambulatory surgery)."

                              "Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional outcomes and quality of life.1 2 While less than 30% of patients experience short-term postoperative morbidity following IPAA,3-5 up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations.1,2,6-8 Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.1\n\nGiven the high safety profile, and relative success in treating perianal disease, we sought to use a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients with ileal anal anastomosis and ileal pouch fistulas. This trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Subjects who are refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Subjects enrolled will be those that meet current indications."

Stem cells are a kind of pluripotent cells with the ability of self replication. The self-renewal and differentiation characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, as well as cytokine secretion effect and immune characteristics, provide the possibility for mesenchymal stem cells to treat ischemic stroke. After the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells, the secretion of soluble media including growth factors and cytokines may be the main mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of intravenous injection of ischemia tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic stroke. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ischemic tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ischemic stroke patients with neurological dysfunction."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. They are used by multicellular organism to organize, coordinate, and regulate multiple functions of cells and tissues in the body. They are considered as chemical messenger molecules that send signals from one cell to another within or between various body parts. Hormones are responsible for regulating many physiological processes and behavioral activities such as growth and development of the body, metabolism, homeostasis of intracellular and extracellular fluid, and reproduction. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function. The phase I clinical study named \" Single-group, open-label clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for early sex hormone deficiency in middle-aged people\" showed that AD-MSC therapy for patients with hormone deficiency is safe, can improve the sexual quality of life in both men and women. A significant statistical increase of testosterone levels was observed in male patients at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month. In female patients, the FSFI was 20.70 at baseline and increased to 27.1 at 12 months after AD-MSC infusion (p<0.05). There were no significant changes in AMH, FSH, or E2 infusion compared to baseline in the 16 enrolled patients. Within those under 45 years old, FSH and E2 tended to increase at 3 months after ADSC infusion and decreased at the follow-up after 6 and 12 months. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

The overall prevalence rate of stroke in China was 1,596 per 100,000 people in 2016, 4.6 times higher than the rate of 345.1 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 70% of the survivors have disabilities in varying degrees. In addition to rehabilitation therapy, there is no therapeutic drugs of remarkable curative effect for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. The latest data show that the annual recurrence rate of ischemic stroke in China is as high as 17.7%.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in many clinical studies for different diseases. In addition to differentiating into multiple cell types and promoting the recovery and repair of the brain by replacing damaged cells, mesenchymal stem cells also secrete cytokines and neurotrophic factors to support and stimulate the growth of other endogenous cells. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. These characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells provide a new therapy for the treatment of stroke."

                              "Since December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has been fierce and spread rapidly. As of 24:00 on March 4, 2020, China has reported a total of 80567 confirmed cases, 5952 existing critically ill cases, and 3016 dead cases. The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to 26 countries worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 infected patients, especially the critically ill cases.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the COVID-19 published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. Several reports demonstrated that the first step of the HCoV-19 pathogenesis is that the virus specifically recognizes the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by its spike Protein. This receptor is abundant in lung and small intestinal tissues, but is also highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in almost all organs, including the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The main organ injured by the HCoV-19 is the lung. In fact, HCoV-19 can also involve the nervous system, digestive system, urinary system, blood system and other systems. Therefore, when the initial symptom is discomfort of other systems in the early stage, it is often easy to be misdiagnosed and delay treatment. Moreover, the HCoV-19 is a noncellular form consisting of RNA and protein, which cannot be copied independently. It needs to bind to cell surface receptors to enter the cell to complete the replication, and then be released again. Therefore, once the HCoV-19 enters the blood circulation, it can easily spread to all systems throughout the body, which may be the pathological mechanism that the HCoV-19 directly or indirectly causes neurological symptoms.\n\nIt seems that the key to cure the COVID-19 pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung. MSCs, owing to their powerful immunomodulatory ability, may have beneficial effects on preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. MSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate.\n\nHere we conducted an MSC transplantation pilot study to explore their therapeutic potential for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. To explore the effective treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia for the current prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia to find a key and effective clinical treatment means, to fight against the epidemic."

                              "Symptomatic arthritic conditions of the foot and ankle including osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies and others can be painful and disabling conditions that lead to a reduced quality of life. Major symptoms include pain, stiffness, swelling, and difficulty walking. Many patients may be initially treatable with non-invasive measures such as analgesics, ankle-foot orthosis, physical therapy and medications such as steroids; however, over time, surgery becomes necessary to improve quality of life and maintain function. Arthrodesis is a well-known procedure that can reduce pain and result in a foot/ankle that can withstand an active lifestyle.\n\nBone graft is used to stimulate new bone formation at the operative site by providing osteogenic cells with osteoinductive factors with an osteoconductive matrix. Although autologous bone is often used as the structural graft material for fusion procedures, donor site morbidity (e.g., pain, infection, and fracture), limited supply, and inconsistent osteogenic activity continue to be associated problems. The quality of an autograft is dependent upon the age and medical condition of the patient, as well as the number of viable mesenchymal and osteoprogenitor stem cells that are present in the specimen. This tissue is harvested during the surgical procedure; the process can prolong morbidity at the harvest site. The ideal bone graft would offer osteogenic cells, osteoinductive factors, and an osteoconductive matrix with a consistent supply of viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs)-but without the morbidity of autograft.\n\nDue to the limitations associated with autograft, researchers are pursuing the use of bone-graft substitutes to promote arthrodesis. Bone-graft substitutes now being used by surgeons include ceramic synthetics, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), demineralized bone matrices (DBMs) and other allografts; these may be used alone or in combination. Allografts available as substitutes for autograft offer some of the benefits of autograft without its limitations-but do not contain viable MSCs and OPCs.\n\nTrinity Evolution is an allogeneic cancellous bone matrix containing demineralized cortical bone (DCB) as well as viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem cells. Adult mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells, such as those in Trinity Evolution, are the precursor cells that differentiate into osteoblasts-the cells responsible for bone growth and repair.\n\nTrinity Evolution provides the required osteoconduction, osteogenesis, and osteoinductivity necessary for successful bone grafting. It offers viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem cells and demineralized cortical bone-all in a single product. Data from preclinical studies with Trinity Evolution have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo safety and effectiveness. Trinity Evolution is a \"minimally manipulated\" tissue that is considered an allograft, and as such, is labeled for bone repair for all orthopedic and podiatric indications where autograft is used. In this study, Trinity Evolution will be used as a substitute for autograft and/or standard allograft in the following arthrodesis procedures: tibiotalar, subtalar, calcaneocuboid, talonavicular, double fusions (i.e. calcaneocuboid and talonavicular), and triple fusions (i.e. subtalar, calcaneocuboid, and talonavicular)."

In the absence of nausea or vomiting, participants could have been considered to have Grade B GVHD if:\n\nother causes of diarrhea had been ruled out (eg, Clostridium difficile, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection, or oral magnesium administration), and if\nthe low stool volume reflected the effects of fasting, narcotics, or antidiarrheal medications.\n\nParticipant must have adequate renal function as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min per 1.73 m^2. For participants 1 to 18 years of age, creatinine clearance is calculated using the Bedside Schwartz equation:\n\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR, in mL/min per 1.73 m^2) = (0.413 * height [cm])/serum creatinine (mg/dL)\n\nFor participants younger than 1 year of age, renal function is determined using the Schwartz equation adjusted for this age group:\n\nCreatinine clearance (mL/min per 1.73 m^2= (height [cm] x 0.45)/ (serum creatinine [mg/dL]).\n\nParticipant has a minimum Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Level of at least 30 at the time of study entry.\nParticipant (or legal representative where appropriate) must be capable of providing written informed consent.\nFemale participants of childbearing potential (\u226510 years of age) are required to use a medically accepted method of contraception and to agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for the follow-up time period. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method.\nMale participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method or abstinence) during the study, including the follow-up time period.\nThe participant must be willing and able to comply with study requirements, remain at the clinic, and return to the clinic for the follow-up evaluation during the study period, as specified in this protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipant has Grade B aGvHD with skin-only involvement.\nParticipant has received any second line therapy to treat aGVHD prior to screening.\nParticipant has received systemic agents other than steroids and prophylactic agents for primary treatment of aGVHD.\nParticipant shows evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or other active pulmonary disease, which is likely to require more than 2L of oxygen via face mask, or an estimated fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) of 28% via other delivery methods in order to sustain an O2 saturation of 92%.\nParticipant has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the participant including but not limited to uncontrolled infection, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.\nParticipant has received any stem cell agents (other than hematopoietic graft) during study participation or within 30 days prior to study entry. Previous use of irradiated granulocytes within 30 days is permitted.\nParticipant has received an HSCT transplant for a solid tumor disease.\nParticipant has had prior treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including remestemcel-L.\nParticipant shows evidence of severe (required treatment) hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction at screening.\nParticipant had positive laboratory test results indicating infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at any time and/or active hepatitis B or C virus infection within 3 months prior to screening.\nParticipant shows evidence of encephalopathy, as defined by a change in mental status since the onset of aGVHD.\nParticipant is a female who is pregnant, lactating, or is planning a pregnancy during study participation, or in the follow-up period.\nParticipant currently being treated for a solid tumor malignancy.\nParticipant has participated in any interventional clinical trial for an aGVHD therapeutic agent. However, in exceptional cases, experimental agents may have been administered to enrolled participants at the Investigator's discretion.\nParticipant has participated or is currently participating in any autologous and allogeneic stem cell or gene therapy study for the treatment of aGVHD. Participants participating in investigative protocols aimed at modification of the transplant graft (such as T-cell depletion) or aimed at modification of the conditioning regimen are allowed in the study.\nParticipant has a known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or to murine, porcine, or bovine proteins."

The neutrophils exude, the platelets aggregate, and the small vessels of the graft get thrombosed, resulting in ischemic damage,leading nonfunction grafts.In addition, if the A\u3001 B antibodies remain high level, it can lead to acute humoral immune rejection. A lot of research confirmed that the ABO incompatible is a risk factor of postoperative short- and long-term survival. And mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are characterized by the properties of immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, which make MSCs great attractive in treating immunological diseases (including transplant rejection) and organ/tissue ischemic injury. So we conduct this clinical study,to confirm the effect of MSCs in ABO incompatible liver transplantation by comparing the incidence of primary nonfunction, acute rejection, biliary complications and survival rates."

                              "This is a prospective, multicenter (with two performance sites under the auspices of Case Western Reserve University Clinical and Translational Science Award (CWRU CTSA) at University Hospitals and at MetroHealth Medical Center), double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infusion in 20 new onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients with moderate to high disease activity despite adequate doses of methotrexate (MTX) for 12 weeks (at least 10 weeks of which has been at a dose of >/=15 mg per week). The study is a single dose, phase I clinical trial, and this is the first time that this product will be infused in RA patients. After a screening period, the baseline visit will be conducted. Patients will halt their concomitant MTX 3 days prior to the MSC infusion and may resume their methotrexate at Day 7 following MSC infusion based on their disease activity score. This is a dose escalation study of a total of 20 patients with three groups of five patients each and five placebo patients. Patients will be randomized to receive MSC or placebo infusion using a computer-generated randomization scheme that takes into account that there are two sites. The first cohort will consist of a total of six patients. Of these six patients, five patients each will receive a single infusion of 2 million/kg MSCs and one patient will receive placebo infusion. The second cohort will include a total of seven patients, of these seven patients; five patients will receive 4 million/kg MSCs and two patients who will receive placebo infusion. The final cohort consists of a total of seven patients. Of these seven patients, five patients will receive 6 million/kg allogeneic MSCs and two patients will receive placebo infusion. Infusion will occur on Day 0. Post-infusion study visits will occur on Days 1 (Visit 3), 7 (Visit 4), 14 (Visit 5), 28 (Visit 6), 56 (Visit 7), and weeks 24 (Visit 8), 39 (Visit 9) and 52 (Visit 10). Phone calls will occur on Day 4, 21, and 72. Subject safety and tolerability of the single dose of MSCs will be evaluated at these study visits by reviewing interval histories, administering patient questionnaires (legacy [Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID 3) / Short Form 36 (SF36)] and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive technology CAT), performing physical exams and spirometry, and obtaining safety laboratories. Special attention will be given to exacerbation of RA or \"flare\". This study will also explore the efficacy measures: Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) and American College of Rheumatology20/50/70 (ACR20/50/70 will be calculated. Since the primary hypothesis is that infusion of MSCs will induce a state of immune tolerance, various assays to detect post-infusion changes in cells subsets, function or protein biomarker will be repeated at Day 7 and/or 14 and compared to baseline values (with-in subject comparison). Biomarkers to look at cell-subsets will be drawn. Selected patient samples will be stored for exploratory studies using Mass Cytometry (Cytof 2). Lastly, for those subjects who are agreeable to undergo the procedure, a bone marrow aspiration will be performed prior to infusion with allogeneic MSCs. MSCs from RA bone marrow will be expanded, banked, and used for future translational studies."

                              "The first-in-human Phase 1 study component will evaluate two dose levels of RAPA-501-ALLO off the shelf cells in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, with key endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501 ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As of April 6th, 2021, an estimated 132.1 million people have contracted the virus and 2,866,000 deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 30.8 million people diagnosed and 556,000 deaths. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 22.4 million people diagnosed and 375,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation) caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such, therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes hyperinflammation due to \"cytokine storm\" and \"chemokine storm,\" tissue damage, hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.\n\nThe mechanism of fatal pneumonia in experimental murine coronavirus infection is mediated by innate inflammasome activation, a resultant robust infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, and a subsequent increase in multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Importantly, the CD4+ and CD8+ adaptive T cell response to experimental coronavirus infection can be either curative or disease propagating. Viral-induced pulmonary inflammation has also been evaluated in non-human primate models, which have confirmed that dysregulated immune activation during viral pneumonia involves T cell subset imbalance, a downstream monocyte-derived inflammatory cascade, and resultant epithelial cell injury. In humans, severity of viral-induced lower respiratory tract infection correlates with increased numbers of effector memory CD8+ T cells in the airway. As recently reviewed, human coronavirus infection represents an ongoing battle between virus and host, with the nature of the response dictating disease cure or alternatively, aggravated lung disease. Evidence exists that the adaptive immune system contributes to pulmonary inflammation during SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease: that is, bronchoalveolar fluid from such subjects had increased T cell numbers and increased Th1-associated molecules IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IP-10. This downstream adaptive T cell-mediated inflammatory response is driven in part by the SARS-Co-V protein viroporin 3a. Specifically, viroporin molecules activate the NLRP3 inflammasome that links innate-to-adaptive inflammatory responses. Furthermore, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 express an open-reading-frame ORF3a molecule, which also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nThe nature of immunity during resolution of symptomatic COVID-19 infection has recently been reported, namely: emergence of antibody-secreting cells and CD4+ T follicular helper cells; increase in perforin- and granzyme-expressing CD8+ T cells; and relative lack of an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In marked contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 disease had greatly increased plasma levels of cytokines (including IL-2 and TNF-alpha) and chemokines (including IP-10 and MIP-1-alpha) (Huang et al., Lancet, 2020). Collectively, these results indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses that occur in severe COVID-19 is detrimental and that effective anti-inflammatory approaches may ultimately prove to be therapeutic. However, as previously detailed, the more advanced Stage 3 COVID-19 disease is characterized by an ARDS component, and cytokine storm, as such, novel approaches to treat the COVID-19 viral pneumonia should optimally incorporate both an anti-inflammatory element and a tissue protection/tissue repair element.\n\nStage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6 therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3 COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.\n\nRAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are \"reprogrammed\" ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a \"hybrid\" product. The hybrid phenotype inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of Stage 3 COVID-19-related ARDS.\n\nIn general, classical autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and viral-induced inflammatory disease are driven by predominance of Th1/Th17-type responses with a relative insufficiency of the counter-regulatory immune suppressive Th2 and TREG subsets. TREG cells, which are defined in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor, have been extensively studied in experimental models for their capacity to modulate autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and transplantation complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. Importantly, T cell production of IL-2 or exogenous IL-2 administration drives lung inflammation during experimental viral infection; therefore, given the known role of TREG cells as a consumer of IL-2, there is a strong mechanistic rationale for a beneficial contribution of TREG cells during viral-driven lung inflammation. Furthermore, in an experimental murine models of virus-induced lung inflammation and lung injury, interventions that augmented TREG cell number and function accelerated the repair of lung injury. And, Th2 cells, which are defined in part by their expression of GATA3 transcription factor, were described thirty years ago as a powerful counter-regulatory population to prevent Th1 cell predominance. It is important to note that clinical data indicates that maneuvers that increase immune suppressive cell populations, including TREG cells, can reduce severe inflammatory disease such as graft-versus-host disease without impairing anti-viral immunity. In addition, in both experimental models and clinical studies, an appropriate level of TREG cells can result in an overall improvement in pulmonary inflammation during viral bronchiolitis. Collectively, these findings indicate that T cells expressing a combined TREG/Th2 phenotype would predictably yield beneficial effects in the setting of viral-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury associated with severe Stage 3 COVID-19 disease.\n\nClinical trials have evaluated both TREG and Th2-type cells for various conditions, most prominently transplantation complications. In general, thymic-derived natural (n)TREG cells are thought to express a more stable phenotype than post-thymic induced (i)TREG cells; by comparison, iTREG cells can mediate more potent suppression. Nonetheless, both nTREG and iTREG cells are susceptible to differentiation plasticity, which creates concern that a potentially therapeutic TREG population might convert to pathogenic Th1/Th17 phenotypes in vivo. Ex vivo expanded (n)TREG cells were evaluated in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using cord blood donors; more recently, the same research group has developed ex vivo expanded (i)TREG cell therapy to limit transplant complications. In addition, ex vivo expanded nTREG cells have been evaluated in the setting of type I diabetes mellitus; this clinical trial found that TREG therapy was safe and at least transiently effective in improving disease control. Furthermore, in the setting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a disease propagated by a severe Th1-driven peripheral and central inflammatory response, a clinical trial of nTREG cell adoptive transfer identified that the intervention was safe and showed promise in terms of ALS disease amelioration. Finally, in a phase II study of rapamycin-resistant Th2 cell therapy in the setting of low-intensity allogeneic HCT, adoptive Th2 cell transfer was safe and associated with a shift towards Th2 polarization in vivo, preservation of donor engraftment, stabilization of mixed chimerism, a low rate of GVHD, and potent anti-tumor effects in patients with refractory hematologic malignancy. Collectively, these clinical trial results indicate that the adoptive transfer of TREG and Th2-type populations can be safely administered, even in the allogeneic HCT setting, and can mediate beneficial modulation of inflammatory conditions.\n\nEx vivo manufacturing can be utilized to generate induced (i)TREG cells from the post-thymic pool of peripheral T cells. In the current protocol, the manufacturing method will focus upon mTOR inhibition, which is an established intervention that promotes the induction of TREG cells. In combination with mTOR inhibition, the culture system that is utilized incorporates cytokines that promote both a Th2 and a TREG phenotype, namely, IL-4, TGF-beta, and IL-2. Finally, the protocol will include a TREG/Th2 cell product comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, as these counter-regulatory T cell subsets express differential T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires and a diversity of effector mechanisms that can potentially enhance an anti-inflammatory effect. For RAPA-501 manufacture, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are collected from a steady-state apheresis and subjected to the following two-step culture intervention: in step 1, a severe starvation step results in T cell de-differentiation, which is realized through both selective media utilization and the addition of FDA-approved pharmaceutical agents that potently inhibit mTOR signaling; and in step 2, re-differentiation of T cells occurs using co-stimulation agents and Th2- and TREG-type polarizing cytokines. After 6-days in culture, the resultant TREG/Th2 population is cryopreserved in single-use aliquots at protocol-driven therapeutic doses. T cells of type II cytokine phenotype are characterized in part by their expression of the transcription factor GATA3 whereas regulatory T cell populations are identified in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor. At culture initiation, a very low frequency of T cells express either GATA3 or FOXP3. In contrast, the RAPA-501 cell product manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture conditions expresses a high frequency of T cells that are either single-positive for GATA3, single-positive for FOXP3, or double-positive for both GATA3 and FOXP3. Importantly, this transcription factor profile is expressed in both manufactured CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is important to note that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations with TREG function have been defined, including a CD8+ TREG population that potently suppresses GVHD; it is potentially advantageous to have both subsets represented in a therapeutic product because CD4+ and CD8+ TREG cells utilize differential effector mechanisms.\n\nRegulatory T cell populations can suppress pathogenic effector T cell populations by several defined mechanisms, including through expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidase molecules, which act to hydrolyse pro-inflammatory ATP towards the immune suppressive adenosine substrate . Indeed, TREG cells that express CD39 possess increased suppressive function and have been associated with resolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, suppressive function of human TREG cells is mediated in part by CD73. T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture condition have an increase in expression of the TREG-associated effector molecules, CD39 and CD73. In addition to the CD39/CD73 ectonucleotidases, TREG cell function has also been correlated with expression of CD103, which is an integrin that dictates epithelial lymphocyte localization. Indeed, CD103 and IL-2 receptor signaling cooperate to maintain immune tolerance in the gut mucosa; furthermore, CD103-expressing TREG cells are critical for amelioration of experimental chronic GVHD . T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture condition have increased expression of the TREG effector molecule CD103.\n\nIn experimental models, the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy is dependent upon successful engraftment and in vivo T cell persistence. Importantly, the T cell differentiation state helps dictate in vivo persistence, with less differentiated cells having increased persistence. Murine rapamycin-resistant T cells, which expressed a T central memory (TCM) phenotype, had increased in vivo engraftment potential relative to control T cells. In addition, human rapamycin-resistant T cells also had increased engraftment in a human-into-murine model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. T cells with reduced differentiation relative to the T effector memory (TEM) population have increased in vivo persistence and mediate increased in vivo effects, including the TCM subset, the na\u00efve T cell subset, and more recently, the T stem cell memory (TSCM) subset. This relationship between T cell differentiation status and in vivo T cell function is relevant to TREG cells, as: (1) TREG cells of TCM phenotype were more effective at reducing experimental GVHD relative to TREG cells of TEM phenotype; and (2) TREG cells that expressed the stem cell marker CD150 were highly effective for the prevention of stem cell graft rejection. T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture condition are enriched for cells having a reduced differentiation state consistent with a T stem cell subset, including expression of the CD150 marker.\n\nIt is also important to assess the cytokine secretion profile of the manufactured RAPA-501 cells. First, it is critical that the cell product is capable of IL-4 secretion, which is the driver cytokine for subsequent Th2 differentiation. Second, it is desirable that an adoptively transferred T cell population is capable of secreting IL-2, as this capacity indicates a progenitor function that permits T cells to expand more readily in vivo without the need for exogenous IL-2 . Finally, it is important that the RAPA-501 cell population has reduced secretion of the Th1- or Th17-type cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and GM-CSF. The manufactured RAPA-501 cell product secretes IL-4 and IL-2 with minimal secretion of Th1- or Th17-type cytokines.\n\nRegulatory T cells can also be defined in part by their ability to suppress the proliferation or function of effector T cells. Importantly, manufactured TREG/Th2 cells potently suppress Th1/Tc1 cell secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. To assess the mechanism of suppression, experiments were performed using the transwell assay, whereby effector T cells and RAPA-501 cells are separated by a filter that prevents cell-to-cell contact but allows cell communication by small soluble mediators such as cytokines. RAPA-501 cells acted in a TCR-independent manner to suppress the cytokine secretion capacity of effector T cells. Because no co-stimulation was provided to the transwell chamber containing RAPA-501 cells, RAPA-501 cells did not require co-stimulation to modulate inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. The following cytokines and chemokines were reduced by RAPA-501 cells in this transwell assay, with relatively equal suppression mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of RAPA-501 cells: CCL1, CCL2, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCL26, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, IL-6, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-10. The ability of TREG cells to consume IL-2 is a commonly described phenomenon, although previous studies identified the requirement of cell-to-cell contact for IL-2 consumption. As such, RAPA-501 cells are uniquely capable of modulating the level of multiple inflammatory cytokines in a contact-independent manner. These results suggest that RAPA-501 cells represent a suitable candidate for neutralization of multiple cytokines and chemokines associated with various diseases, including viral-induced lung inflammation. In light of this capacity of the RAPA-501 cell product to suppress T cell-mediated inflammation in a TCR-independent manner, RAPA-501 therapy is highly suitable for allogeneic, off-the-shelf treatment applications.\n\nFurther experiments were performed to evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might also regulate human CNS microglial cells, which are myeloid-derived cells that are analogous to the peripheral monocyte population. To evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might modulate pro-inflammatory microglial cells in a contact-independent manner, the ability of RAPA-501 cells to reduce the inflammatory state of the microglial cell line HMC3 was tested in a transwell assay. RAPA-501 cells reduced the HMC3 cell secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma and the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 at the relatively low ratio of RAPA-501 cells to microglial cells of 1:40. These results demonstrate that the RAPA-501 product is capable of inhibiting cytokine and chemokine secretion from myeloid-derived populations in a contact- and TCR-independent manner, thereby providing a further rationale for allogeneic, off-the-shelf utilization of the RAPA-501 product.\n\nRAPA-501 cell product for stability of T cell phenotype was also evaluated. That is, it has been determined that a limiting factor of TREG cell therapy may be differentiation plasticity, for example, whereby TREG cells can be influenced by inflammatory cytokines to lose their TREG characteristics and adopt a Th1-type inflammatory state, which may then promote disease pathogenesis. To address this possibility, the RAPA-501 cell capacity to modulate T cell differentiation transcription factors after an extended culture interval that involved T cell co-stimulation, the absence of mTOR inhibitors, and the presence of the polarizing inflammatory cytokines IFN-alpha and IL-6 was studied. These experiments demonstrated that the RAPA-501 cell product had remarkable differentiation stability (continued expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; lack of up-regulation of TBET).\n\nIn summary, RAPA-501 cells express a phenotype consistent with a regulatory T cell population, including: stable expression of the TREG and Th2 transcription factors FOXP3 and GATA3; expression of the TREG functional molecules CD39, CD73, and CD103; expression of a reduced state of T cell differentiation, including expression of the stem cell marker CD150; secretion of a Th2 pattern of cytokines with minimal secretion of Th1/Th17-type cytokines; functional suppressive capacity against both effector Th1/Tc1 cells and pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, including reduced levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; and a capacity to inhibit inflammatory effectors in a contact- and TCR-independent manner. Collectively, these characteristics of the RAPA-501 product predicts that this therapy represents a novel and promising candidate to treat COVID-19-related ARDS.\n\nThis is a first-in-human phase 1/phase 2b study evaluating allogeneic RAPA-501 cell therapy in participants with COVID-19-related ARDS. Two phase 1 cohorts will be evaluated, namely, a low-dose Cohort 1 (40 x 10^6 cells/infusion) and a high-dose Cohort 2 (160 x 10^6 cells/infusion); this phase 1 component will utilize dose-limiting-toxicity (DLT) as a primary endpoint. Provided that safety is demonstrated in the phase 1 study component, each RAPA-501 dose cohort can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b component. In the phase 2b component, for each RAPA-501 dose level determined to be safe, patients will be randomized to receive RAPA-501 cells (n=19) or placebo (n=19). After infusion of either RAPA-501 cells or placebo, these randomized cohorts will continue on standard-of-care therapy (not protocol-driven). The primary endpoint of the phase 2b study is 30-day mortality, with the statistical goal of reducing mortality in RAPA-501 recipients relative to the randomized, placebo-control cohort.\n\nStudy participants must be hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, specifically: SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by RT-PCR or equivalent test; pulmonary infiltrate on radiologic examination; and a diagnosis of ARDS requiring intensive respiratory support including non-invasive ventilation such as high-flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation. The study consists of: (1) a study enrollment step (screening); and (2) after eligibility is confirmed, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be performed. On Cohort 1, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be at a dose of 40 x 10^6 cells/infusion; three participants will be initially treated, with one week separating participants in this phase 1 component to evaluate for DLT, which will be defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity attributable to RAPA-501 cells within 7-days of infusion. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe (either 0/3 or 1/6 having a DLT), then Cohort 1 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe, treatment on Cohort 2 can be initiated, which will evaluate the infusion of RAPA-501 cells at a dose of 160 x 10^6 cells/infusion. In the same manner as Cohort 1, if Cohort 2 therapy is deemed to be safe, Cohort 2 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. The study will be comprised of three main stages: (1) the above-detailed 30-day interval relating to the primary study objectives; (2) an extended, total 90-day interval to continue relatively intensive clinical monitoring of potential efficacy and safety endpoints; and (3) an extended, total 6-month interval to provide long-term clinical follow-up and to continue to monitor for laboratory parameters relating to immune and viral endpoints."

                              "This is a pilot study evaluating the addition of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) infusions to corticosteroids for the early treatment of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is a major complication following allogeneic stem cell transplant. GVHD occurs when T-lymphocytes in the donor graft respond to signals from recipient cells and cause tissue damage. This process can lead to organ injury, increased risk of infection, and graft failure. Corticosteroids have been used as the primary therapy for acute GVHD for decades, and guidelines currently recommend their use as front line treatment. Recent prospective data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network shows that GVHD will be cured in about half of patients with steroids alone. Patients who do not respond to steroids are considered steroid-resistant, and this is associated with much worse survival. It is possible to predict which patients will go on to have steroid-resistant GVHD by measuring the plasma concentration of the molecule called suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2). BMSC infusions have been used to treat steroid-resistant acute GVHD successfully, but despite a track record of safety, little is known about the use of BMSC in the early treatment setting. The main objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of administering BMSC within 5 days of diagnosis of acute GVHD. Our study will for the first time use the ST2 biomarker to more accurately assign acute GVHD to steroid refractory or sensitive, and explore changes in ST2 and other biological markers of BMSC function and their correlation with clinical response. In the process of this study, we will assess the safety and feasibility of early treatment according to our regimen, obtain estimates of efficacy at important GVHD therapy time points, and determine if treatment with BMSC can prevent the progression of GVHD in patients with high risk of GVHD progression as measured by biomarkers.\n\nThe Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center NIH has developed a BMSC repository at NIH. The NIH BMSC are a third party, early passage product based on the EU manufacturing approach. The NIH BMSC cellular product was administered safely to transplant recipients with steroid-resistant acute GVHD in a phase I study (protocol 12-H-0010, IND #14596) conducted from March 2012 to October 2012 at NIH. This pilot study is a continuation of the previous study and open to allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients at NIH (age greater than or equal to 4 yrs) with de novo acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy either directly after allogeneic transplantation or following treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion. Subjects will receive BMSC infusions (target dose of 2 times 10(6) BMSC/kg for up to 12 doses) in addition to standard upfront therapy with corticosteroids. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients without a treatment-related severe adverse event (TRSAE) at day +56. Responses will be assessed at day +28 and +56 from the initial diagnosis. Responses will be correlated to changes in GVHD biomarkers including ST2, Reg3a, TNFR1, and IL-6. Subjects will be enrolled at first diagnosis of acute GVHD, and the first BMSC infusion will be given within 120 hours of the first dose of corticosteroids. BMSC infusions will be given twice weekly for the first 4 weeks. Subjects with a complete response at the end of week 4 will not receive further infusions. All other subjects will receive BMSC infusions weekly for four additional weeks. Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Research samples will be drawn at regular intervals to explore biological correlates of response and to investigate the mechanism of action of BMSC."

Acute GVHD is defined using the NIH consensus definition inclusive of classic acute (less than or equal to 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features) AND persistent/recurrent/late onset acute (> 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features). Subjects with stage I and II skin only (overall Grade I) or isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement are eligible if the treating physician deems that systemic corticosteroid treatment is indicated. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is desirable, but not required for study entry because enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results. Patients must be diagnosed with a first episode of acute GVHD requiring systemic corticosteroids and associated with preceding administration of a cellular therapy including stem cells and donor lymphocyte infusion. Patients who were treated for GVHD associated with another cellular therapy product (e.g. prior allogeneic transplant or DLI) will be allowed into the study.\n\nPrevious immunosuppressive therapy\n\nThe patient must have received no systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of new acute GVHD (e.g. pentostatin, etanercept, denileukin difitox, etc.), except for a maximum 120 hours prior corticosteroid therapy. This does not include immune suppressive therapy for GVHD prophylaxis (e.g. calcineurin inhibitor, sirolimus, MMF, etc.). It is expected that most patients will be receiving GVHD prophylaxis as part of their transplant regimen, thus patients developing acute GVHD while on GVHD prophylaxis will still be considered eligible. Concurrent or addition of locally-acting steroid therapy (skin creams, oral budesonide, or any other locally-acting steroid preparation) is allowed.\nThere is one exception to the above stipulations: Use of the oral medication MMF (in addition to systemic corticosteroids) for the treatment of acute GVHD will be allowed. MMF is commonly given early in the treatment of acute GVHD, but it has not been shown to improve outcomes compared to steroids alone in a randomized, prospective study; therefore, treatment with MMF will not exclude patients from BMSC treatment.\nAge: Age greater than or equal to 4 years old will be allowed.\nBirth control: Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are being treated on this study.\nInformed consent: Signed informed consent and/or assent is required. Assent and educational materials will be provided to, and reviewed with, patients under the age of 18. The informed consent process will begin at recognition of patient eligibility.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nBreast feeding or pregnant females (due to unknown risk to fetus or newborn).\nKnown allergy to gentamicin."

                              "Stroke is the second leading cause of death behind ischemic heart disease worldwide. Traditional treatments have some limitations whereas preclinical data suggest that stem cell therapy is a promising regenerative medical treatment given the limited capacity of the central nervous system for self-repairs after ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that umbilical cord blood-derived Mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusion improves the outcomes of several neurological damage conditions, including stroke. These results encouraged us to initiate the phase I/II clinical trial aiming to evaluate the safety and the efficiency of UC-MSC transplantation in the treatment of patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke. This case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between 2021 and 2023. In this trial, 48 patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke will be enrolled into 3 groups: UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route group (16), UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal administration route group (16), and control group (16). The UC-MSC group (IV/intrathecal) will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x106 cells/kg patient body weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be measured using these scales including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-NIHSS, Functional Independence Measure -FIM, Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS, Fine motor skills-FMS, 36-Item Short Form Survey -SF-36. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months post-intervention."

                              "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial tumor of childhood and prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory disease is < 10% and there is no standard therapy for these patients. Research toward immunotherapeutic agents has intensified as monoclonal antibody targeting GD2, when incorporated into upfront NB therapy, prolongs survival. Allogeneic Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been utilized in patients with NB with evidence of a graft versus tumor (GVT) effect but transplant related mortality (TRM) has nullified the survival benefit. In an effort to harness the GVT effect of allogeneic transplant and lower TRM, harvested viral specific cytotoxic T-cells from the donor will be infused early post-HSCT to the HSCT recipient to shorten the recovery of immunity toward the most significant viral infections. The investigators will also retrovirally transduce the viral specific CTL with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene complex such that the tV-CTL can expand, via their native T-cell receptors in response to viral infections post-HSCT and carry the capability of killing tumor cells through their transduced receptor which, on the extracellular component of the CAR, has specificity for GD2 expressed on the surface of NB. In essence, the investigators intend to take the specificity of the monoclonal antibody to GD2, already utilized in therapy for NB, and combine this specificity with the cytotoxicity of T-cells to target NB. The investigators hypothesize that the infusion will be safe and viral specificity of the tV-CTL will provide long term immunity to both viral infections and the investigators will see anti-tumor effects."

In each cohort, eligible patients will be randomized to the two treatment arms at the ratio of 3:1 (BX-U001: Placebo). The patients in the first cohort will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 0.75\u00d710^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. In the second cohort, the patients will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 1.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. After the one-time infusion on Day 1, patients will be monitored for 52 weeks. During the study, besides BX-U001 or placebo infusion, patients will remain treated with their previous conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than biologics) in the same dosage/way.\n\nAt the end of Week 12, the patients will undergo efficacy evaluations to determine their response to treatment using the response rate of American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20). For patients who lack response to treatment as defined by not achieving 20% improvement on tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at Week 12, they will receive standard of care treatment including csDMARDs, biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and adjunctive agents such as corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and analgesics at Week 14.\n\nThe overall study duration is planned to be 2 years."

Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will be expanded in vitro. The IMP incorporating the ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied on the wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia (on Day 0 and Week 6.1).\n\nWound measurements from Visit (V) 2 and V9 will be used to determine the cell amount for the IMP treatments on V3 and V10, respectively.\n\nPatients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.\n\nThe wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing. The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.\n\nPain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-CVU three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 after the first IMP applications are included."

                              "Severe aplastic anemia is characterized by severe deficiencies in peripheral-blood platelets, white cells, and red cells. These defects in mature cells occur because aplastic bone marrow contains severely reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells. To date, Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants are routinely used to treat patients with many different diseases, including various cancers and blood disorders, such as aplastic anemia. The main sources of HSCs are bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood. However, challenges include obtaining enough functional HSCs to ensure optimal engraftment, and avoiding immune rejection and other complications associated with allogeneic transplantations. Novel abundant sources of clinical-grade HSCs are therefore being sought.\n\nOur novel studies have demonstrated that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted rapidly (in 4 days) into AD-HSCs on a large scale (2X108-9 cluster of differentiation 34\uff08CD34\uff09positive cells) by transfection of small RNAs to the the early region 1A (E1A)-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines. In vitro, AD-HSCs expanded efficiently and resembled cord-blood HSCs in phenotype, genotype, and colony-forming ability. In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. we show that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted into AD-HSCs by transfection of small RNAs to the E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines.

In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. In the safety aspect, we saw no evidence of leukemia, teratoma and other cancers in the blood, testes and subcutaneous tissues of transplanted mice. More importantly, our preliminary data have shown that AD-HSCs can reconstitute hematopoietic function in five patients with severe aplastic anemia. Based on these premilitary studies,, we have determined to conduct a further clinical investigation in multiple medical centers. In this study we plan to enroll up to 90 patients, to make a comprehensive assessment for this new treatment regimen and to show it is equal or superior to the current immunosuppressive regimen. Patients will be in the study for one years for treatment and active monitoring. All patients will be followed until death."

                              "The devastating effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS COV-2) infection is caused by a robust cytokine storm that leads to lung tissue damage. Several studies have found that the severity of the disease is correlated with the release of excessive proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, preferentially targeting lung tissue. This finding was confirmed by the high level of plasma cytokines found in the most severe COVID-19 patients associated with extensive lung damage. As a result, it is essential to find an effective treatment option to control the devastating cytokine storm of COVID-19 and regenerate the damaged lung. Although mesenchymal stem cells are a powerful tool for clinical applications, they have limits in terms of administration, safety, and variability of therapeutic response. It is interesting to note that the MSC secretome composed of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteins, and extracellular vesicles could be a valid alternative to their use. It is not only easier to preserve, transfer and produce the secretome, but also safer to administer.\n\nPrevious studies reported that the hypoxic condition of MSCs could enhance the release of their active soluble molecules known as Secretome-MSCs (S-MSCs), such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 that useful in alleviating inflammation. Moreover, they could also increase the expression of growth factors such as VEGF and PDGF that accelerate lung injury improvement. These active molecules could potentially serve as a biological therapeutic agent for treating the severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to recent studies, we successfully isolated the S-MSCs from their culture medium using tangential flow filtration (TFF) strategy with several molecular weight cut-off category. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities treated with S-MSCs in Indonesia."

Once this has been established, up to 6 administrations of BM-MSC EVs will occur, at each to be given over a period of no more than 3 months. A maximum of 50 cm2 in total wound surface will be treated, and each administration will occur 14 days (+/- 7 days) but no less than 7 days apart. If the wound closes prior to 6 administrations, no additional doses will be given. Wound closure will be determined by complete re-epithelialization that is not subject to re-injury during dressing changes or as a result of normal daily activities (e.g. wearing clothing, eating, sleeping). After the 6 doses of BM-MSC EVs are given, the wound will be followed monthly for a period of 4 months to the termination of the study at 8 months or, in the event the wound closes before receiving all 6 doses, for 4 month after the wound closes. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarTM will be used to measure the target lesion at all visits.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the safety of applying single administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month\n\nSecondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine the safety of applying multiple administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month and to determine if there is clinical benefit (>50% closure) of applying BM-MSC EVs to DEB wounds\n\nPLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: 10 subjects will be treated on the protocol with AGLE-102."

                              "Conventional treatment modalities have not been able to provide complete and sustained resolution of symptoms following damage to the articular cartilage. Despite the numerous techniques available today, complete healing of damaged or defective cartilage or consistent reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage does not occur, and continuous drug administration or secondary surgeries are common.\n\nResearch in mesenchymal stem cells has had a rapid acceleration over the past decade and MSC-based therapy has become one of the objects of investigation for a new branch of medicine termed regenerative medicine. This emerging technology shows great promise for producing transplantable cartilage constructs to restore the function of degenerated joints.\n\nCARTISTEM\u00ae, a combination of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and sodium hyaluronate, is intended to be used as a single-dose cellular therapeutic agent for cartilage regeneration in human subjects with cartilage defects of the knee as a result of ageing, trauma, or degenerative diseases."
