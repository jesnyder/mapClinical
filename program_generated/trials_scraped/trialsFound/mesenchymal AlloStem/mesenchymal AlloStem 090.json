Concomitant midfoot or forefoot procedures, such as osteotomies, tendon or metatarsal procedures are not exclusionary.\nHas treatment planned for the arthrodesis which does not require the use of screws.\nHas any active infection of the hindfoot, a systemic infection or bacteremia.\nHas received any treatment within the past 12 months which may interfere with bone metabolism [bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, Reclast) and calcitonin (Miacalcin)].\nIs scheduled to have any surgical procedure on the contralateral foot within 6 weeks before or after the study procedure."
