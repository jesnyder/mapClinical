There are not enough cartilage cells to fill the defect so cartilage cells need to be mixed with MSCs. MSCs or Mesenchymal Stem Cells are naturally occurring cells that provide growth factors and cell signals that play a role in tissue repair. MSCs can be found in bone marrow and in the fatty tissues (i.e., area under the skin of the belly or breast) of patients. Fibrin glue is a product made from the naturally occurring compounds in blood which cause clotting. This glue hardens into a gel-like substance into which cells such as cartilage cells (chondrons) and AMSCs can be placed."
