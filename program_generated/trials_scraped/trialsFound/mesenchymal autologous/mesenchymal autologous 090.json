                              "The main goal of this phase 1 clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of an autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) application as therapy for drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy in a one-center study. It is well known that drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy is a dramatically invalidating disorder for which applied stationary and outpatient therapies have no real clinical effect. Therefore new approaches are needed to reach remission, to stop disease progression, and to increase patient quality of life. For this study, adult (18-60 years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included into study. Drug-resistance was defined by a lack of any evident clinical response (i.e., no decrease in seizure frequency or reduction in disease progression) of the pts with symptomatic epilepsy to carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, lamotrigine, or phenobarbital (i.e., anti-epileptic drugs[AEDs]) as monotherapies and in different combinations over the previous one calendar year. The criteria for exclusion were patient refusal to participate, unfavorable reactions to therapy, CNS inflammatory conditions, chronic psychoses, CNS tumors, relapses of chronic somatic or neurologic diseases, and blood positivity for hepatitis B or C or HIV. The plan included the inclusion of 30 pts in the study group and 30 pts in the control group over a period of 5 years. The pts were randomized to standard treatment with AEDs (control group) or AEDs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, study group). The MSCs were obtained from bone marrow samples of the same patient and were purified and expanded ex vivo in a specialized cellular biotechnology laboratory. The MSCs were characterized by immunophenotyping as CD90+CD105 +CD45-CD34-cells. After 3 weeks of cultivation in vitro, a portion of the MSC were additionally cultured for 7 days in Neurocult-XF proliferation medium to obtain neuroinduced MSCs. Neuroinduction was proved by the presence of the genetic markers nestin and neuron-specific enolase. Finally, 40-101 x 106 autologous cultured MSCs and 2.7 - 8.0 x 106 autologous neuroinduced MSCs were harvested, resuspended in saline solution containing 5% autologous blood serum for injection, and, following a measurement of the viability (98% cells), transferred to the clinical center.\n\nThe pts in the study group received one slowly delivered (over 5-10 minutes) intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded autologous MSCs in a volume of 20 ml, and 5-7 days later, each patient in the study group received an additional slowly delivered endolumbal injection of the neuroinduced MSCs in a volume of 5 ml. Both unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections (over one day following the performance of the procedures) and the early (up to one month) and late (up to 6 months) clinical effects, including complications, were evaluated. Unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS, i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia). Later potential unfavorable systemic reactions of the CNS and vascular system, including infectious and noninfectious complications of the progression of the disease to be controlled, were examined. All of the events were documented in medical cards. In cases in which these events exhibited dangerous characteristics, they were declared to members of the monitoring board (the center's ethical committee) for the evaluation of the exclusion of the patients from the study or the termination of the clinical study.\n\nAlso evaluated were the possible beneficial effects of MSC-based therapy in the pts of the study group. These effects were detected via clinical observations at selected therapy time points (i.e., 3 and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy) and electroencephalography measurements prior to and one year after the therapy. To determine the possible changes in disease progression, signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated. For the evaluation of cognitive impairment, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination. The handicapping effect of disease on daily life was scoring using the Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy Scale. State anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital anxiety and depression scale . Changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The processes of voluntary attention and performance were studied with Schulte tables according to the methods of Kraepelin. Schulte tables were used to study sensorimotor reaction times and the distribution and stability of attention. The \"Account of Kraepelin\" method was used to study health, fatigue and the stability of attention. The assessment of short-term memory was performed via the method of memorizing 10 words; this method aims to determine the volume and speed of oral-aural memory.\n\nMain clinical characteristics that are used for disease monitoring were \"yes\" or \"no\" responses (regarding therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease at the early (3 months) and late (12 month and more) time points after therapy. To evaluate partial responses to therapy, the numbers of pts who exhibited 50% reductions in seizure frequency were assessed. Seizure type (i.e., generalized tonic-clonic, partial complex, simple partial, and multiple types of seizures) was also evaluated along with changes in seizure type during the treatment course.\n\nElectroencephalography recordings were performed at admission and across the monitoring period using a Mizar EEG 201 encephalography system with biopotential registration from 16 body points according to the \"10-20\" scheme. The observed electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves were analyzed in 3-min segments (with further recalculation for each 1-minute segment) prior to (at admission) and 1 year after MSC application. The peak frequency of the alpha waves was also calculated. Both the spontaneous state and the state after the loading probe (hyperventilation and photostimulation) were evaluated for each patient. The characteristics of the electroencephalographies (EEG) were attributed to local and diffuse cortical alterations. We evaluated the paroxysmality index, quantities of local and generalized spikes of epileptiform waves per minute, peak frequency of EEG activity, index of slow activity, and summarized points of EEG pathology signs. EEGs with epileptiform activity included spikes, spike-slow waves, and high-amplitude spikes. The EEG recordings were performed based on standard and additionally proposed criteria . All of the assessments were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to determine the potential differences due to the additionally performed MSC-based therapy. A patient's therapy was terminated at any time point if immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The final observations of the patients included clinical and EEG assessments at 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy. The summarized data for the pts in the control and study groups were collected in an electronic database for further analysis and interpretations."

The total process takes 6-8 weeks. After this time, perform the osteotomy and enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia and the residual cavity is filled with bioimplant containing the MSV-H.\n\nOnce the bioimplant, there will be clinical controls at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months, to follow the evolution of regeneration by bone cavity in panoramic radiograph and CT scan.\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach to therapy twice, combining a tissue engineering protocol (bioimplant) consisting of autologous mesenchymal cells have already been approved by the unit cell production of Valladolid (MSV-H), and a new protein matrix obtained autologous serum crosslinked in order to stimulate the regenerative capacity of maxillary cystic bone defects."

                              "The role of regenerative therapies has gained more importance due to increased number of SCI in the wake of recent anti-terrorism operations by the armed forces and non-availability of any curative treatment for this category of patients. The promising results of preliminary clinical trials have proved that adult stem cells especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells can be safely injected and well tolerated and have shown functional improvement in SCI patients. The successful treatment in these patients will not only improve functional status of these otherwise debilitating patients, but can also reduce the burden on health care facilities. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression. In this study patients suffering from sub-acute and chronic phase of spinal cord injury shall be included. Patients will undergo detailed screening through MRI and motor and sensory assessment by ASIA score. Further evaluation will include electromyography (EMG) and tests for electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) will also be done. Bone marrow aspiration will be done from iliac crest of the patients, followed by mononuclear cells (MNCs) separation by density gradient centrifugation. MNCs will be washed and cultured in tissue culture flasks. After 48 hours non-adherent cells will be removed from culture. Medium will be changed twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence. At that point MSCs will be harvested and after microbiological and other quality control testing the cellular preparation will be diluted to final concentration and infused by intrathecal injection.\n\nPrimary outcome measure is safety which will be determined by clinical evaluation by two independent neurologists during one month of hospital stay after receiving treatment course.\n\nSecondary outcome measures will include American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and NCV/EMG."

The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.\n\nAbdominal fat will be harvested through a small incision and processed by the Mayo Clinic IMPACT laboratory using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and previously established standard operating procedures (SOPs) to produce clinical grade, autologous, culture-expanded AD-MSCs for subsequent intradiscal injection. All injections will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis. A final visit for evaluation and imaging will be conducted at the end of the study."

                              "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide epidemic disease that the global prevalence of it was estimated to be approximately 210 million individuals and accounting for more than three million deaths annually. And currently, it is the fifth chief cause of death in the United State of America. COPD is characterized by chronic, irreversible inflammation of the airways and has two pathologic features, emphysema and bronchiolitis.\n\nThe most relevant feature in the lung emphysema is airflow limitation, resulting from the loss of alveolar wall and enlargement of alveolar space distal to the terminal bronchiole. Cigarette and air pollution are the most major factors for developing COPD. Unfortunately, aside from supplemental domiciliary oxygen for the small number of patients who demonstrate resting arterial hypoxemia and smoking cessation for continued smokers, there are no interventions that have been unequivocally shown to prolong survival in patients with COPD. In the preprocessing phase, patients will underwent a complete evaluation of the pulmonary function test with spirometer to measure the FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, cardiac evaluation (clinical examination, six minute walk test, echocardiography TTE(transthoracic echocardiography ), and electrocardiography),chest X-ray, chest computed tomography scan (helical/high resolution),o2 saturation by oximeter, as well as routine laboratory tests (blood gas, urinalysis, coagulation, complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen, fasting glucose, creatinine, AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALT(alanine aminotransferase), C-reactive protein, serology for hepatitis B and C, antihuman immunodeficiency virus, and treponemal test for syphilis (FTA-ABS)). The Dyspnea Scale Score test, modified according to the British MMRC, was also conducted, according to Mahler and Wells and Curley.And quality of life measures will assess according to SF-36(Medical Outcomes Study 36-Items Short-Form Health Survey) questioner.\n\nPatients will taken to the operating room, placed in a prone position, and administer a spinal anesthesia. Approximately, 120 mL of bone marrow will aspirated from each puncture and after preparation about 60 million autologous MSCs will transplant by bronchoscopy into the endobronchial of these patients."

Patients will be treated with 10-100 million aaMSCs every 3 months for a total of 4 intrathecal injections over 12 months. Reduced dose treatments will be allowed based on specific adverse events. Multiple biomarkers will be tracked throughout the clinical trial and correlated with response to treatment. This study was initially performed at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and subsequently expanded to the two other Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona and Florida.

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Onset typically occurs in early adulthood. Patients present with intermittent symptoms that are partially reversible; this form is termed relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Over time, most patients develop secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) which manifests as irreversible and gradual neurological impairments that often progress without acute relapses. Beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate represents the first line therapeutic option for RRMS. Clinical trials confirm that show partial efficacy, though they do not prevent the onset of secondary progression. SPMS, is the consequence of axonal loss and neurodegeneration and no current therapy has been effective. Stem cell therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. Clinical indications for adult stem cells, which can be safely harvested and normally behave well without formation of tumours, are rapidly increasing. The majority of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both, which can be easily obtained in clinically sufficient numbers from peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or umbilical cord blood and placenta. MSC can readily be isolated from a small sample of bone marrow and rapidly expanded so as to generate large numbers of cells for autologous therapies. When administered intravenously have an immune suppressive effect that can ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. When intravenously injected, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of brain-resident cells. Several disease models demonstrate axonal neuroprotection following MSC therapy, with some evidence that this is potentially mediated through the production of neurotrophic/growth factors, and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSC. For that reasons, MSC have become the focus of research as a potential cell therapy for inducing neuroprotection in human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.\n\nA growing body of literature confirms the therapeutic MSC biological properties, and provide a plausible mechanism of action to guide clinical trial design with a number of phase I/II trials in MS patients now underway. Experimental clinical trials in MS are being considered or have recently been initiated by several research groups, which are testing the therapeutic potential of different sources of MSC. Learning from previous clinical studies, and taking advantage of the potential that adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair and remyelination, to plan a clinical trial in patients with inflammatory MS seems reasonable. We propose a safety trial of a single intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSC into 8 subjects with RRMS. The trial proposed here will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC therapy during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS can establish a immunomodulatory and regenerative microenvironment and reverse neurological disability in RRMS patients."

                              "Knee osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Treatments involve high costs in terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded \"in vitro\" and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has demonstrated that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation through its action on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one carried out in an equine by our research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy evidence proposed treatment protocol. Our research group has also experience in preparing clinical-grade MSC from bone marrow for other clinical trials and has all the necessary facilities and permissions to comply with GMPs imposed by recent EU legislation. Finally, our clinical team has a wide experience in regenerative therapies in several previous clinical trials for bone and cartilage.\n\nWe present here an alternative proposal, aiming to anti-inflammation and regeneration by injection of single dose of mesenchymal stem cells expanded from autologous bone marrow by the GMP-complying IBGM-Valladolid procedure (MSV). Treatment involves two non-invasive surgical procedures with low morbidity: obtaining bone marrow under local anesthesia and sedation, and 4 weeks later, articular injection of the cell product (20 millions MSVs). The injection of cells does not even require anesthesia and obtaining bone marrow requires an outpatient admission two hours following safety criteria.\n\nPatients will be evaluated clinically, including pain score (VSA), pain and disability indexes (WOMAC and Lequesne) and life quality (SF-36), and by radiologic and MRI procedures no contrast and allowing quantification of morphological and structural changes of the cartilage region studied (MRI T2-mapping).\n\nThe design of the study is an open-label prospective, multicenter study. It will recruit 12 patients with osteoarthritis of II-IV Kellgren and Lawrence grades, Patients will be evaluated clinically by previous studies imaging (X-rays and MRI). If they are eligible for the study we shall provide them information about the clinical trial with the \"Patient Information Sheet, quoting them for the Inclusion Visit. In the \"Inclusion Visit\" if the patient decides to participate in the test should sign the Informed Consent Document and a schedule for MRI and X-rays will be scheduled. The results of this exploration will be considered the standard to which compare any given change in the controls at 6 and 12 months. On this visit, routine preoperative examinations are performed (EKG, chest X-ray AP, basic analytic coagulation tests and identification of HIV, Lues and hepatitis B and C and the valuation by the Internal Medicine Service).\n\nDuring the visit V0 we shall verify that all inclusion criteria persist and not exclusion criteria have appeared, and we shall program V1 (to obtain bone marrow) and provide a preliminary date for MSV injection 4 week later (V2). After application, the patients will have follow-up schedule at 8 days (V3), 3 (V4), 6 (V5), 12 (V6) and eventually 24 months (V7) as detailed below.\n\nV0: Eligibility. Clinical History. Analysis, Imaging test. Programming of the following visits V1 (day 0): Bone marrow aspiration under local anesthesia and sedation V2 (day 23). MSV Implantation. V3 (+8 days from Implantation): Security evaluation. V4 (+3 months from Implantation): Security evaluation.

                              "Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused by an immune reaction to beta cells in the pancreas. Today, insulin injection is a routine treatment for diabetes. Although injected insulin maintains blood glucose, this method cannot result in physiologic reaction to blood glucose changes. Moreover, patients are encountered with diabetes complications like neuropathy, nephropathy, visual and cardiovascular problems, and hypoglycemic unawareness. Therefore, based on previous studies, a treatment option that leads to pancreatic beta cell restoration and inhibits the immune response to these cells could be a hopeful clinical choice. In this clinical trial, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be used for immune response modulation and improving regeneration. Hence, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 patients with type-1 diabetes will be selected and after clarifying the procedure and fulfilling the agreement to participate in this trial, they will be sorted in two groups. Bone marrow is aspirated from patients bone and after isolation of Mesenchymal stem cells and characterization of these cells, patients in case group will be intravenously injected by 1 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells per kg of patient's body weight in each dose in week 0 and 3, whereas the control group receives a placebo. Then patients will be followed up for 1 year. During this time, different parameters would be evaluated in weeks 1, 2,4, and Months 2,3,6,9 and 12. Laboratory screenings will be done during this period to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment."

At its first phase, 15 consenting patients with MS are included.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nConsenting patients fulfilled the following 4 inclusion criteria for this study:\n\nthe clinical criteria of Poser et alfor definite MS;\nmen and nonpregnant women aged 25 to 65 years;\nduration of disease longer than 5 years; and\nfailure to respond to the currently available and registered agents for MS (ie, interferons, glatiramer acetate [Copaxone], and immuno-suppressors), as manifested by an increase of at least 1 degree in the EDSS score during the past year or the appearance of at least 2 major MS relapses during the same period.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\npatients who were treated with cytotoxic medications (ie, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and azathioprine) during the 3 months before the trial;\npatients with significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure or any other disease that may interfere with the ability to interpret the results of the study;\npatients with an active infection; and\npatients who showed severe cognitive decline or were unable to understand and sign the informed consent.\n\nBone marrow aspiration is performed under short general anesthesia with puncture from the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or a right lateral position. Approximately 200 mL of bone marrow inocula are obtained from each patient.\n\nMSC Preparation and Culture A culture of purified MSCs is prepared under aseptic conditions (positively pressurized clean rooms) using filtered sterilized Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with low glucose lev- els (Qiagen, Valencia, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- nystatin solution (all from Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit- Haemek, Israel).\n\nMesenchymal cells are cultured for 40 to 60 days, until they reach confluency, and then harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide-containing medium in liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C). At 2 weeks, a sample is taken for sterility testing and quality control. After sterility confirmed, the MSCs are transferred to the laboratory on dry ice, thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and washed twice with normal saline solution to remove any residual dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells are then resuspended in normal saline at a concentration of 10x106/mL to 15x106/mL. Two-thirds of the total number of cells (usually 60x106 to 100x106) are injected intrathecally, and one-third, intravenously. A sample of the cells to be injected is tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis; cells (98%) should express the surface markers characteristic of MSCs (CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and be negative for CD34, CD45, and CD14.\n\nTreatment Protocol All patients receive an intrathecal injection via a standard lumbar puncture (mean of 1 million cells per Kg of body weight) and an intravenous injection of 0.3-1 million cells per kg, intravenously..\n\nAn extension phase is scheduled for patients completing the first phase of this trial as an open prospective study with repeated intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous MSC in patients from the initial trial and 10 additional ones (total up to 24 patients) with progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive or relapsing-progressive). Patients should be defined as failures to first and second lines of immunomodulatory treatments experiencing deterioration (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS scale) during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major relapse without sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of body weight, intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or IV-injections of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the trial is 4 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).\n\nImmunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month 6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS) analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune activation or of regulatory cell phenotype."

Bone marrow is aspirated from the iliac crest (hip bone) of patients with osteochondral defects intraoperatively under complete sterile, aseptic conditions and under proper anaesthesia (general, local). The bone marrow aspirate is placed in tubes and transferred under aseptic conditions to the Tissue Culture Unit in the Biochemistry Department at the Cairo University School of Medicine where it is processed and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and grown in culture for 2-3 weeks. After this time interval, the cells are reprocessed and the cell pellet is obtained. Implantation of the cell pellet into the osteochondral defect of the joint after embedding it on a proper scaffold is performed followed by subsequent defect coverage with an autologous periosteal flap obtained from the proximal tibia to seal the defect and maintain the cell pellet in place. The patients will be assessed clinically with scoring systems preoperatively as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively to assess relief of symptoms and joint function. Radiological assessment (X-rays and MRIs)of the affected joints will be performed at the same time points aforementioned to assess integrity of the formed cartilage. Second look arthroscopy and biopsy will also be performed to histologically assess the repair tissue and grade it via arthroscopic grading system according to the International Cartilage Repair Society guidelines."

                              "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, rapidly progressive, and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying treatment. Recent insights into pathophysiologic mechanisms suggest a crucial role of deprivation of neurotrophic factors which have been shown to be secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In a recent phase I/II study adipose-derived autologous MSCs were delivered intrathecally to patients with early MSA utilizing a dose-escalation design. At a dose of 50 million MSCs, injections were generally well tolerated, but thickening of cauda equina nerve roots was observed which was either asymptomatic or associated with low back pain. The rate of disease progression assessed using the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) was markedly slower compared to a matched control group. An even more favorable side effect profile and virtually lack of disease progression was seen in an add-on cohort receiving 25 million MSCs per injection. Neurofilament light chain, an index of central axonal degeneration, decreased in all patients receiving that dose. MSC administrations resulted in a marked, dose-dependent increase of neurotrophic factors in CSF. 2-year survival was significantly higher than observed in natural history cohorts.\n\nBased on these findings we are now conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design phase II trial of adipose-derived intrathecal autologous MSCs in MSA with the goal to establish optimal treatment frequency and simultaneously derive placebo-controlled efficacy and safety data in preparation for a multicenter phase III trial. Up to 76 adult subjects with MSA will be enrolled. To ensure a homogenous patient population with comparable rates of disease progression, we will restrict the study to early cases but still fulfilling strictest diagnostic consensus criteria. Participants will undergo a subcutaneous fat biopsy to derive autologous MSCs, which are cultured, expanded, and prepared for delivery in Mayo's Cell Therapeutics Lab. In a first phase, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 25 million MSCs at two different injection intervals (every 6 months or every 3 months) as the two active arms or lactated Ringer's solution as the placebo arm. A recruitment hold after half the subjects have been enrolled will allow for an interim futility and efficacy analysis to select the \"winner\" active treatment assuming futility criteria are not met. The study will then restart recruiting the second half of subjects utilizing 2:1 randomization (\"winner\" active: placebo). Patients undergo clinical assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to derive the primary endpoint, the rate of disease progression assessed using UMSARS total and a mixed effects regression model. MRI of the head and lumbar spine will be completed at baseline and 12 months to expand safety data and to assess the rate of atrophy of selected brain regions using morphometric measures as surrogate markers of disease progression. Spinal fluid before and after administrations, as well as stem cell product media will be collected to further explore biological properties and effects of MSCs and to explore selected spinal fluid markers as biomarkers of disease progression."

                              "Interventions to alter the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee are elusive and joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far, the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators' pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion criteria."

The trial will include 25 adult, non-ventilator-dependent patients with clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated from adipose tissue, expanded ex vivo and then, after ~8 weeks, intrathecal (IT) autologous delivery of MSCs will be performed. There will be 5 treatment groups of up to 5 patients each. Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2 doses of cells separated by 1 month. Groups will be completed sequentially so that patients will not be enrolled into the next treatment group until at least 3 patients in the preceding group have completed the treatment and 1 month of additional observation without significant toxicity. All patients will be followed on a regular basis until death or for a minimum of 2 years after completion of the final infusion. Initial clinical follow-up will be weekly with scheduled blood, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations. After 1 month, patients will have clinical evaluations at 3 month intervals, or earlier if indicated by clinical status.\n\nAddendum: Five subjects from the Group 5 dosing level will received additional injections of MSCs in an extension of the original study, if tolerated."

Patients were randomised into three groups and treated intrathecally (IT) or intravenously (IV) with autologous MSCs (1x106/Kg) or placebo. At 6-months, treatment groups were crossed over and patients re-treated with either MSC or placebo. During the 2-months run-in period and the 12-months after treatment, participants were followed using EDSS, 25-foot timed walking, 9-hole peg test, neurocognitive tests, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, optic coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and dynamic visual tests."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. They are used by multicellular organism to organize, coordinate, and regulate multiple functions of cells and tissues in the body. They are considered as chemical messenger molecules that send signals from one cell to another within or between various body parts. Hormones are responsible for regulating many physiological processes and behavioral activities such as growth and development of the body, metabolism, homeostasis of intracellular and extracellular fluid, and reproduction. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function. The phase I clinical study named \" Single-group, open-label clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for early sex hormone deficiency in middle-aged people\" showed that AD-MSC therapy for patients with hormone deficiency is safe, can improve the sexual quality of life in both men and women. A significant statistical increase of testosterone levels was observed in male patients at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month. In female patients, the FSFI was 20.70 at baseline and increased to 27.1 at 12 months after AD-MSC infusion (p<0.05). There were no significant changes in AMH, FSH, or E2 infusion compared to baseline in the 16 enrolled patients. Within those under 45 years old, FSH and E2 tended to increase at 3 months after ADSC infusion and decreased at the follow-up after 6 and 12 months. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

However, even with rehabilitation therapy, 50% to 95% of stroke survivors remain impaired. There is thus a great need for new therapeutic developments for patients with disability after stroke, which is largely unexplored. Regenerative cell-based therapies offer long-term hope for many patients with stroke, as stem cells might be possible for dead or injured neural cells to be replaced after acute stroke. In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation."

The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD. The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the ability of HB-adMSCs to alter AD-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and markers associated with amyloid deposition, Amyloid beta 40 and Amyloid beta 42. Subjects will also be assessed for cognitive deficits measured by changes from baseline values using Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), Altoida Neuro Motor Index (NMI) for Digital Biomarkers, and Clinical Dementia Rating Questionnaire (CDR)."

It is estimated that 26.9 million Americans 25 years old or older have clinical degenerative arthritis of some joints, with a higher percentage of affliction in the older population. Its clinical manifestations include joint pain and impairment to movement, and surrounding tissues are often affected with local inflammation. The etiology of degenerative arthritis is not completely understood; however, injury, age, and genetics have been considered among the risk factors.\n\nDegenerative arthritis is a progressively debilitating disease that affects mostly cartilage, with associated changes in bone. Cartilage has limited intrinsic healing and regenerative capacities.\n\nDue to the increasing incidence of degenerative arthritis and the aging population coupled with inefficient therapeutic choices, novel cartilage repair strategies are in need.\n\nThe availability of large quantities of MSCs and their potential for ready chondrogenic differentiation after prolonged in vitro expansion have made MSCs the most hopeful candidate progenitor cell source for cartilage tissue engineering.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue and cultured, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery.\n\nIt will be stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

In this study 27 patients with cryptoglandular anal fistulas were treated with freshly collected autologous adipose tissue.A clinical assessment of the patient prior to inclusion was undertaken and a loose seton placed for at least 6 weeks prior to fat injection. An MRI of the pelvis was performed before inclusion. Fistulas with secondary tracts and/or cavities were excluded. The operation was performed in one procedure including liposuction and injection of adipose tissue. A sample of adipose tissue from all 27 patients was analyzed. AT-MSCs were isolated and characterized using cellular and molecular analyses. Clinical and MRI-scanning evaluation of fistula healing and evaluation of ano-rectal function was performed after 6 months. AT-MSCs phenotype was compared between responders and non-responders with respect to fistula healing. The evaluation of the AT-MSCs was performed in a blinded manner."

                              "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders, affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to respiratory failure. Numerous studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the clinical and pathological features of ALS. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine) effect of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrollment. Patients are recruited for a clinical trial not longer than 1 year from disease diagnosis. Then, patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one application of BM-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications (each administration every two months) of BM-MSCs. Subsequently, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period."

                              "Study Rationale Emphysema is one of the two main components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes over many years to airway obstruction by the loss of elastic recoil around the smallest airways. Emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking and it is widely accepted that the disease is caused by excessive proteolytic activity by proteases and a chronic inflammatory process, characterized by a cellular influx consisting of macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. This inflammatory response is steroid resistant and leads to slow but persistent alveolar destruction, resulting in enlarged lungs with bullous parts in both lungs. In addition to a central role of innate immunity, recent studies suggest that also (auto)antigen specific immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\nCurrently, the only treatment available for severe emphysema is lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to remove the most destroyed parts of the lungs. The surgery is generally performed in two separate sessions with a 10-12 weeks interval, with each lung as a separate surgical target. This surgical treatment allows improved ventilation in the remaining less affected areas of the lungs as demonstrated by post-surgical clinical improvement of lung function and increased survival in a subgroup of patients. Delayed wound healing after LVRS is an important clinical problem. It may lead to prolonged hospital stay due to air leakage from the lungs into the thoracic cavity. Lung emphysema patients are at high risk for prolonged air leakage after this surgery, which is most likely explained by the inflammatory process related to the disease.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into several cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. In recent years it has become evident that bone-marrow derived MSC (BM-MSC) have potent immunomodulatory effects on T and B cells and in animal models of chronic inflammation in vivo. In addition, it has been shown that MSC express or release a variety of soluble factors implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling and cell growth. Importantly, encouraging results have recently been obtained with the treatment of severe steroid resistant Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) with donor (allogeneic) BM-MSC. Furthermore, in our institute autologous BM-MSC are currently under investigation for treatment of tissue injury due to autoimmune disease (Crohn's Disease) and allogeneic immune responses (renal transplant recipients with biopsy proven subclinical rejection). The combination of the immunosuppressive, growth-potentiating and anti-apoptotic properties of BM-MSC may lead to accelerated wound healing after LVRS and might induce lung repair. In the present phase I study the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous (i.v.) administration of BM-MSC prior to LVRS in a small group of severe pulmonary emphysema patients. Results of this safety and feasibility study may lead to future studies on the use of BM-MSC for immunomodulation and induction of repair in patients with pulmonary emphysema and milder stages of COPD.\n\nObjective To test the safety and feasibility of intravenous administration of autologous BM-MSC after one-sided LVRS and prior to a second LVRS procedure for patients with severe pulmonary emphysema.\n\nStudy design Open label, non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective clinical trial. Patients are operated in two sessions; initially on one lung without pre-surgical infusion of BM-MSC, followed by a second surgical procedure on the contralateral lung which is preceded by two i.v. infusions of BM-MSC one week apart, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the lung surgery.\n\nStudy population Patients of at least 40 years of age with end-stage emphysema who are eligible for lung volume reduction surgery.\n\nIntervention The intervention consists of two doses of BM-MSC infusions in 10 patients with a one week interval, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the second LVRS respectively.\n\nStudy endpoints\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n1. Safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of two doses of BM-MSC with 1 wk interval after the first LVRS and prior to a second LVRS. Toxicity criteria will be evaluated by grade according to WHO.\n\nSecondary endpoint:\n\nDifference in days between post-surgical transpleural air leak of the lung in each patient after the first (no infusion of BM-MSC) and second surgical (3 weeks after the last i.v. infusion of BM-MSC) intervention.\nHistological responses in resected lung tissue (measured by immunohistochemistry of markers of inflammation, fibrosis and repair)."

This study is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the Department of Neurology & Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem in Israel. In addition, ALS patients could also be referred to the clinical site above by other medical centers.\n\nAll patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrollment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 2 years. ALS patients identified as \"predisposed\" will be approached and requested to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Overall, 14 patients will be recruited.\n\nTreatment will start with the lowest dose (94x106 cells) and the dose will be increased to the next medium and high dose (141x106 and 188x106 respectively), for the next patients group only following safety analysis.\n\nThe expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is in-between two weeks up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day during visit 2 (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every month during a \"run in period\" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the disease (allowing a time window of \u00b1 5 days for all visits). During the \"run in period\" after about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow aspirate based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last \"run in period\" visit, patients will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM+IT to the early ALS patients.\n\nAfter the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post treatment follow up period of 6 months (allowing a time window of \u00b1 5 days for all visits). Treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, to establish ALS progression rate assessment of the disease will be recorded throughout the duration of the \"run in period\" and the post treatment follow up period."

Cells are selected and expanded under GMP conditions according to the methodology used in previous trials (EudraCT 2005-005498-36, 2008-001191-68 and 2009-0170450-11 ). MSV-H cells are obtained directly from biopsy culture jawbone of the patient by cultivation techniques \"in vitro\" and differentiate for 21 days once conveyed in the matrix with osteogenic differentiation medium of the following composition: DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% P / E, 0.1 mM dexamethasone, 50 mM ascorbate 2-phosphate, 10 mM phosphate \u00dfGlicerol. All differentiation factors have already been approved for clinical use. After the period of the product differentiation can be implanted to the patient.\n\nThe bioimplant is used to refill the bone defects after osteotomy and maxillary cyst enucleation, with 5-10 million cells per unit of 2 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm thick. The cavity is closed with the mucoperiosteal flap and sutured with reabsorbable material. The end point of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and indications of treatment efficacy according to both clinical criteria and objective imaging confirming the volumetric bone regeneration and maintenance over time. For this purposes orthopantomography exploration will be performed before and 2 and 6 months after intervention."

Because some patients with articular cartilage defects may progress to osteoarthritis, such defects need to be repaired even though their exact natural course remains obscure. Traditional methods for repair, such as micro fracture, perforations, abrasion arthroplasty, have not produced consistent satisfactory long term clinical results. Transplantation of autologous bone marrow MSCs expanded in culture would be a promising approach in the repair of articular cartilage defects in human osteoarthritic knees. This method is clinically straightforward to perform because autologous cells can be readily harvested and expanded in culture without losing their capacity to differentiate into chondrocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results obtained with autologous MSCs expanded in culture for the treatment of full-thickness chondral defects in human knee."

Except the hospitalization in stroke units, only thrombolysis has been shown to be efficient to treat acute ischemic stroke in the first three hours after the onset. Increasing brain plasticity after stroke represents an important alternative strategy. Cell therapy provides a functional improvement after cerebral ischemia in rodent models. This \"restorative\" therapy aims to replace destroyed cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. Despite these encouraging experiments, we do not know yet the best way of administration of the stem cells, the best dose and the optimal delay of the graft. The pioneer clinical studies failed to reproduce this benefit for patients probably because of the limited number of studied patients. Therefore, more translational studies are needed to improve our knowledge in this promising field. Among different cell sources, mesenchymal (or stromal) stem cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow offer the advantage of arising from a non tumoral and no modified source and are not sources of immunological or ethical problems.\n\nOur research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of feasibility and safety in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 3 parallel groups)."

                              "Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow. Experimental and clinical studies to date have shown that mesenchymal stem cells represent the most suitable cell type for regeneration therapy after myocardial infarction (MI). After injection into ischemic myocardium, bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) from various animal species can differentiate into multiple cell lineages, including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, thereby improving LV function.\n\nIn Malaysia we have previously demonstrated our capability in isolating and extracting MSC from a small volume of bone marrow aspirates.The isolation, expansion and feasibility of storage, transport and differentiation of human MSC for clinical application has been performed locally. The researchers used autologous BM-MSC, ex vivo expanded, on three patients with end-stage ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who were on the heart transplant waiting list and each patient was injected with MSCs directly into the myocardium during open heart surgery. After twelve months, all patients remained alive and well with significant improvement in cardiac function, quality of life and other parameters including reduction of myocardial scar volume as seen from cardiac scans.\n\nThe same group of researchers further carried out a study on ten patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and refractory cardiac function despite maximum medical therapy to receive autologous BM-MSC implantation via intramyocardial or intracoronary route. All patients remained alive at 1 year while recorded significant improvements in LV ejection fraction and other LV parameters from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Reduction in scar was also noted in six of the patients by 12 months.\n\nFollowing these results, this study aims to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population."

The treatment protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the injections. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as secondary endpoints.\n\nApplications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a \"run-in\" period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.\n\nOne month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post last MSC-injection.\n\nTo establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-\"run in period\" and for the whole duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared to the progression rate during the \"run-in\" period.\n\nThe follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters: WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.\n\nAll selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen. One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using our previously described protocol with slight modification.\n\nOne month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula."

Immunomodulatory therapies are useful in reducing the frequency of inflammatory processes (relapses) but don't delay significantly the progression of the disease, prevent long term disability or induce the repair of damaged tissue. This proposal contemplates the use of adult autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat patients with active MS. This is a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial in which 8 patients with active forms of MS and moderate disability will enter the trial with the primary objective of assessing the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of BM-MSC. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by gadolinium enhancing lesions though magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological effects and immunological effects. Once randomized, patients will undergo BM extraction and once confirmed the availability of the needed dose, they will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms (BM-MSC named XCEL-MC-ALPHA, or placebo). XCEL-MC-ALPHA will be cryopreserved for all patients regardless the allocated arm. At month 6, the treatment will be crossed. Patients will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years."

Arthrosis is one of the most important causes of disability and its treatment with prosthetic surgery is associated with a high cost, and is not free of other complications. Several studies of cell therapy with autologous chondrocytes have shown efficacy in the treatment of this type of lesions, and currently is a common technique for the treatment of focal lesions of articular cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte transplant is associated with morbidity of the cartilage sample removal, which needs intra-articular surgery, and the limited tissue sample for culture. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) have demonstrated chondrocytic differentiation and have been used in animal models for articular cartilage repair. Adipose tissue yields more ASC than chondrocytes are obtained from cartilage, and liposuction is simple and with less adverse events than arthroscopy. It is worth mentioned that culture conditions are less stringent for ASC than for chondrocytes, in terms of number of passages to obtain the amount of cells needed for implantation.\n\nWe propose a randomized clinical trial, in which we compare the surgical implantation of either autologous chondrocytes or autologous ASC to treat chondral knee lesions."

                              "Aims & Objectives:\n\nThe present study describes a novel method to preserve the crestal bone at two-stage dental implants using autologous aBMMSCs, free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded into commercially available collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece) that are stabilized over the implant platform upon surgical implant placement.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nThis study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel method based on histotechnology in crestal bone preservation at two-stage dental implants, as compared to conventional surgical implant placement following the manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nSecondary, changes in the peri-implant soft tissues will be also determined between implant placement and exposure and will be compared between the experimental and the conventional surgical treatment approaches.\n\nStudy design:\n\nBiopsies will be derived from alveolar bone marrow of the alveolar bone under local anaesthesia in each patient belonging to the Experimental Group (Group-A). Briefly, after a thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill will be performed in the alveolar bone of an intraoral edentulous site other than the implant site and a 2x8 mm or 3cc approximately of an osseous core will be harvested. The area and the biopsy will be copiously irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to achieve primary closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict clinical grade expansion protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013; Bakopoulou et al. in preparation). Since MSCs will be isolated and expanded in vitro in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant clean rooms (Biohellenika facilities) meeting the quality guidelines set by the European Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for autologous transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy applications. In Biohellenika facilities, 40ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject in Group-A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the isolation and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin glue will be used to load the BM-MSCs onto a commercially available collagen fleece. At the day of the surgical placement of the implants and chairside, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched with fibrin glue) will be delivered in an insulin syringe containing 10x10E6 cells/200\u03bcl fibrin and will be gently loaded onto the collagen fleece and activated with the addition of CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex will be sutured onto the lingual flap using bioresorbable sutures (5-0 Coated VicrylTM (polyglactin 910), reverse cutting 3/8 circle - 16mm, Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and will be thus gently stabilized over the implant platform head partially covering the buccal bone. Handling of the scaffold will be done with care to avoid doing any harm to the viable cells.\n\nIn the Control Group (Group-B), the implants will be placed crestally following the manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting materials. One system of implants will be consistently used throughout the study in both groups (Osseotite, Certain, parallel wall, Biomet 3i, Palm Beach Gardens, USA).\n\nPost-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for 5 days) will be prescribed to both Groups. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine twice daily and avoid brushing and chewing hard in the treated area for two weeks. During this 2-week period, patients will be followed on a weekly basis to record uneventful healing, and after that patients will discontinue rinsing with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral hygiene. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three to four months to have their implants exposed.\n\nSubjects will be assessed at baseline (T0: surgical implant placement) and T1 (implant exposure at 3-4 months). Clinical recordings will be determined by a single calibrated examiner using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) with an endo-stop attached on it and all measurements will be digitalised using an electronic caliper. A customised metallic caliper will measure the thickness of the bone at the buccal/lingual aspects of the implant. At T0 and T1, clinical recordings will assess:\n\nThickness of mucosa at the top of the alveolar ridge and 2- and 4mm apically, on the buccal and the lingual aspects of the ridge.\nWidth of keratinized mucosa buccally and lingually of the implantation site.\nThickness of buccal and lingual bone at 0, 3- and 6mm from the implant shoulder.\nLevel of of the buccal and lingual marginal bone, in relation to the implant shoulder.\n\nStandardised digital radiographs will be collected at T0 and T1 to linearly determine changes (in mm) in the height of the alveolar bone between the implant shoulder and teh alveolar crest using the VixWin\u2122 Platinum|Gendex software.\n\nGroups will be further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical site at T0 [thin mucosa (\u22642.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (>2.5mm) for Groups-AII/-BII] and all the parameters will be determined and compared on the basis of the surgical approach and mucosa thickness at the surgical site.\n\nA linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine changes in the dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two stage-implants placed either conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex."

                              "Aims & Objectives The present study describes a novel method to regenerate periodontal tissues in periodontal infrabony defects using autologous BM-MSCs, free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded into commercially available collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece).\n\nPrimary objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel regenerative treatment of periodontal infrabony defects using a biocomplex of BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/collagen fleece, as compared to a cell-free grafting substitute of fibrin glue/collagen fleece and to a control treatment approach of open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo document the stability of the enhanced treatment outcome and to continue to assess the safety and effectiveness of BM-MSCs transplantation as compared to the control treatment of open flap debridement over the study period.\nDetermine the immunological and microbiological profiles of the participants throughout the study period in an attempt to understand local and systemic effects of the transplantation of BM-MSCs in chronically diseased sites, such as the infrabony periodontal defect. In addition, the healing response to treatment will be determined throughout the observation period (baseline to 12-months).\n\nStudy Design\n\nInvestigational products aBM-MSCs cultures will be established from osseous biopsies derived from bone marrow of the alveolar bone in each patient belonging to Group A. Briefly, after a thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill will be performed in the alveolar bone and a 2x8 mm osseous core will be harvested. The area will be irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to achieve primary closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes containing HBSS and antibiotics/antimycotics and will be transported to a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant authorized facility meeting the quality guidelines set by the European Union for the preparation of clinical-grade stem cell cultures for delivery to the patient. aBM-MSC isolation will be performed using the enzymatic dissociation method, as previously described (Bakopoulou 2013). For culture expansion, autologous serum obtained from 60ml of venous blood collected from each subject will be used to supplement aMEM cell culture medium, in order to avoid the use of any animal derived reagents, such as bovine serum. The osseous biopsy will be immediately processed to ensure high viability of the established cultures. After expansion for two passages (approximate time needed 16-24 days depending on cell donor) cells will be harvested for delivery to the patient. For cell dissociation and passaging, highly purified, GMP compatible recombinant enzymes (Tryple, Thermo Fisher Scientific) will be used to avoid use of porcine trypsin. At this stage, a sample of 20ml venous blood will be required for the preparation of the autologous fibrin glue in Group B, as in Group A initial bloodletting (60ml) will cover the needs of the cell cultures and fibrin glue preparation. Subsequently, fibrin glue will be loaded with- (Group A) or without- (Group B) stem cells into a commercially available collagen fleece scaffold directly before clinical application.\n\nQuality control of the established BM-MSC cultures before clinical application\n\nBefore delivery to the patient, all BM-MSCs cultures will be evaluated for:\n\nViability using Trypan Blue exclusion\nSterility: cultures will be tested for potential contamination from bacteria, mycoplasma and endotoxins (LAL test)\n\"Stemness\" properties based on the minimal criteria established by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) regarding MSCs (Dominici et al 2006).\n\nNote: Methodology on stem cell characterization methods is analytically described in previous publications by our research group (Bakopoulou et al. 2013).\n\nAfter application of the BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/CaCl2 mixture into the collagen scaffolds, a small sample of the biocomplex of randomly selected cases will be separated using surgical scissors and will be transferred to the lab for further (in parallel to the clinical application) ex vivo characterization of stem cell behavior in a biomimetic microenvironment. This will allow correlation between stem cell behavior and the clinical outcome, since retrieval and analysis of the regenerated tissues directly from the host is not feasible for ethical reasons.\n\nPreparation of autologous fibrin glue Twenty ml of venous blood will be collected from the ante-cubital fossa of patients in Groups A and B and blood samples will be immediately transferred to a falcon tube, which contains anticoagulant. After determination of the platelet counts the blood sample will be centrifuged (2000rpm, 10min) and plasma will be separated and stored in another falcon. Platelets counts will be then determined and the sample will be centrifuged again. PRP (platelet rich plasma containing 1,000,000 plts/ul) will be then separated from the supernatant PPP (platelet poor plasma) and both preparations will be further processed following a standard protocol for fibrin glue preparation (Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece).\n\nDesign of the clinical arm of the study\n\nPre-selection of Subjects Subjects will be recruited from new referrals at the Department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Implant Biology; no external advertising or recruitment will be undertaken. Subjects will be in good general health.\n\nAdmission into the Study Before admission into the study, each subject will be informed by the principal investigator of the nature and risks of the study both orally and in writing (Subject Information Form) and written informed consent (Subject Informed Consent Signature Form) will be obtained. Each subject will be given a copy of their duly signed consent form to maintain for their own records. The subjects' personal demographics and medical history and study suitability in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria set in the protocol will be recorded. Subjects may continue any medications not included in the exclusion criteria; however, these medications should be documented together with any concurrent medical condition not pre-excluded.\n\nProcedures for Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation Any subject, who wishes to withdraw from the study for personal or any other reason, is entitled to do so. However, the reason for the withdrawal of any subject from the study in addition to whether the reason is related to the test product will be recorded by the principal investigator. Any participant failing to attend more than twice is removed from the study. Subjects that experience an adverse event will be excluded from further participation in the study.\n\nIf a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal. Subjects will be asked to consider giving further information as to the reason(s) for the withdrawal. Any information reported will be recorded.\n\nExpected Duration of each subject participation Each subject is expected to attend nine visits in total over a period of 12 months; one screening visit, one treatment visit to receive surgical treatment of the designated area, four follow-up reviews and three additional visits for clinical and radiographic reassessment and sample collection (whole saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), subgingival plaque).\n\nInvestigators' calibration and randomisation Patients will be screened for eligibility by one examiner and will be enrolled one at a time on a continuous basis after obtaining a code number. A trial contributor not involved in data collection will perform the randomisation and announce the treatment modality to the therapist using telephone communication. Clinical assessments will be carried out by a single examiner who will have no access to previous recordings and is not otherwise involved in other clinical procedures. An investigator calibration exercise will be performed to obtain acceptable intra-examiner reproducibility for PPD, CAL, and evaluation of defect anatomy. Intra-examiner reproducibility will be evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (Bland and Altman, 1999).\n\nStatistical analysis of experimental data The analysis will be performed using the IBM Statistics SPSS 20.0, software. Data will be expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD). Unbalances between the test and control groups that are generated by the randomisation procedures will be assessed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and the Fisher's Exact test or the Chi-Square test for categorical variables. The significance of the treatment effects on the dependent variables CAL changes, PPD changes and radiographic changes will be estimated by constructing linear mixed models using the SPSS MIXED procedure. For all analyses the statistical significance will be set at p<0.05.\n\nEthical considerations / Authorisations for stem cell cultures Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece provides state of the art facilities and labs that are operating under the strictest regulations for stem cells processing and storage.

The security levels meet all the standards ISO 27001 and the company is licensed and regulated by the Data Protection Authority.\n\nThe labs are surveyed 24 hours for air quality and equipped with Cryo-View data base System, ISBT 128 barcoding system, Temperature -Liquid N2 level, Security Alarms and two power generators.\n\nStudy Schedule Clinical design and interventions for autologous transplantation of BM-MSCs Subjects with severe chronic periodontitis will be scheduled to receive non-surgical periodontal treatment under local anaesthesia using hand and power driven instruments, in addition to motivation in periodontal care and thorough oral hygiene instructions. Subjects will be clinically reassessed six weeks after the completion of non-surgical treatment and those subjects with remaining periodontal pockets (PPD & CAL \u2265 6mm; infrabony component \u2265 3mm) and no overt signs of gingival inflammation will be screened for suitability to participate in the current study. The screening visit will include an initial full-mouth periodontal examination, intra-oral radiographic examination and fulfilment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. In case of suitability, the nature of the study will be explained in detail to all subjects and a signed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee of the Dental School, AUTh. will be obtained from each participant. Then, patients will be randomly allocated into one of the three treatment Groups (-A, -B and -C). A single defect will be treated in each patient.\n\nSubsequently, an osseous biopsy and blood samples will be collected from the participants of Group A under strict sterile conditions. Each sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013, Bakopoulou et al. in preparation). Since MSCs will be isolated and expanded in vitro in GLP-class clean rooms meeting the quality guidelines set by the European Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for autologous transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy applications. In Biohellenika facilities 60ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject in Group A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the isolation and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin glue will be used to load the BM-MSCs onto the collagen fleece. In addition, a blood sample of 20ml will be collected from subjects in Group B, in order to provide fibrin glue which will enrich the collagen fleece before surgical placement into the osseous defect. Finally, subjects in Group C will not be called for bloodletting as the infrabony defects in these individuals will be surgically managed by open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nAs part of the GLP quality control, the MSCs will be analysed for sterility and endotoxins and will be also tested for potential contamination from bacteria (BD BACTEC\u2122), mycoplasma and endotoxins (LAL test).\n\nLocal anaesthesia (1.8ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine; Lignospan special, Septodont) will be infiltrated in the buccal and lingual aspects of the involved teeth avoiding the papillae. Then, strictly intra-sulcular incisions will be performed to preserve the gingival tissues and in particular the interdental papilla associated with the bone-dental defect (Cortellini, 2012; Cortellini and Tonetti 2007). The defect will be debrided and the root will be carefully planed with the combined use of Gracey curettes and power-driven instruments (EMS Piezon\u00ae, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). Care will be taken to retain the soft-tissue wall of the defects and the osseous defect will be irrigated with saline to control bleeding.\n\nIn Group A, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched with fibrin glue) will be delivered in two insulin syringes each containing 5x10E6 cells/100\u03bcl fibrin and will be gently loaded onto the collagen fleece and polymerized with the addition of CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex will be gently packed into the defect until complete fill. Handling of the scaffold is done with care to avoid any destruction of viable cells.\n\nIn Group B, the collagen fleece enriched with fibrin glue devoid of viable cells will fill the vertical bone defect with caution. In Groups -A and -B the delivery of fibrin glue with/without viable cells will be identical, so that the therapist is blinded to the procedures.\n\nGroup C, patients will receive open flap debridement and root planing of the root surface in a similar manner as subjects in Groups -A and -B, but there will be no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nThe operator will be blinded to the treatment modality (Groups -A and -B), while in Group C since no grafting materials will be used, the treatment modality will become obvious to the operator but this will take place towards the conclusion of the surgery, after the collection of clinical data. Papilla preservation techniques and minimally invasive surgical techniques will be sought in all groups, avoiding scoring the periosteum. Flaps will be repositioned and sutured using a single modified internal mattress suture (5-0 Monosyn, Braun) at the defect-associated interdental area and similar sutures will be employed to close the flaps in any other interdental areas. Two weeks post-surgery clinical observation for uneventful healing or presence of adverse tissue reaction will be performed followed by suture removal.\n\nCase series for tissue engineering In a series of cases (five) having similar inclusion/criteria as above but without going through randomisation tissue engineering is applied following the same methodology as in Group A. In theses cases, the tissue engineered construct (biocomplex) is applied to treat isolated interdental periodontal defects using a newly designed surgical technique the so-called \"closed surgical technique\". In brief, this technique entails retraction of gingival flaps in a closed manner without dissecting the soft-tissues or the interdental papilla. This technique minimises tissue trauma, postoperative discomfort and enhances soft-tissue aesthetics.\n\nPost-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for five days) will be prescribed to all participants. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine twice daily and avoid brushing, flossing and chewing hard in the treated area for four weeks. During this 4-week period, stringent post-operative supportive program care will be instituted at bi-weekly intervals, and after that patients will discontinue rinsing with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral hygiene. Interdental cleaning will commence six weeks post-surgery for all Groups. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three, six and 12 months for periodontal supportive care.\n\nClinical recordings Full-mouth and site-specific periodontal recordings including BOP; Plaque Index (presence/absence of plaque); PPD and CAL will be determined using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW) to the nearest millimetre at six sites per tooth and parallel to the long axis at four time-points; baseline, 6-, 9-, 12-months. Clinical measurements at the designated sites (infrabony defects) will be determined prior to surgery and before anaesthesia (baseline). Intra-surgical assessments will be carried out once during surgery.\n\nIntra-surgical clinical assessments The defect morphology (one-, two-, three-walls or combination) will be determined intra-surgically by the number of bone walls associated with the lesion; The distance between the cemento-enamel junction and the bottom of the defect (CEJ-BD) will be determined in mm; The distance from the CEJ to the most coronal interproximal level of the bone crest (CEJ-BC) will be determined in mm; The total defect depth: the distance between the bone crest and the bottom of the defect (BC-BD) will be determined in mm; The width of the defect width (horizontal distance between the bone crest and the root surface) will be determined in mm.\n\nIf the CEJ is not detectable due to a cervical restoration the restoration margin (RM) will serve as reference point for clinical and radiographic measurements.\n\nRadiographic evaluation Intraoral digital radiography will be utilised to determine the bone regeneration of the infrabony defects at six time points; baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months. Standardised periapical digital radiographs (RadioVisioGraphy; Trophy Radiology S.A., Paris, France) will be obtained using the long-cone paralleling technique. To standardise the exposure geometry, a customised bite-block of an elastic impression material will be adjusted on the sensor holder, stored in sealed plastic containers at room temperature and will be reused during every recall radiographic appointment.\n\nIn a similar manner as the intra-surgical assessment, the following anatomical landmarks will be defined on the x-rays: the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), the most coronal level of the alveolar bone (BC) and the apical extent of bone loss (BD). In more detail, the location of the CEJ will be identified; the most coronal area where the periodontal ligament retains an even width will be identified on the radiograph to indicate the most apical extension of bone loss. The infrabony defect will be calculated by measuring the width of the defect at the most coronal aspect and at the base; the distance between CEJ-BD and BC-BD; the distance between CEJ-BC; the angle between the vertical axis of the root and the interdental bone wall (Tonetti et al. 1993). Radiographic evaluation of bone regeneration will be defined on a high definition monitor by the same calibrated examiner who is blinded to the treatment modality and does not have access to previous recordings. Assessments will be carried out using the measurement tool for numerical measurements (VixWin\u2122 Platinum|Gendex software) with reference to a metal bar of standard length (5mm) that will be attached onto the sensor.\n\nCollection of specimens Samples will be collected in the following order at six time points; baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months.\n\n(i) Saliva Saliva will be collected prior to clinical periodontal measurements or any periodontal intervention and generally in the morning following an overnight fast during which subjects are requested not to drink (except water) or chew gum. Whole saliva samples will be obtained by expectorating into 30ml polypropylene tubes for 5 minutes.\n\n(ii) GCF Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be obtained from the buccal interdental aspects of the defects. Before GCF collection, the surfaces will be gently air dried and isolated from saliva by placing cotton rolls and using a saliva ejector. Then, supragingival plaque will be carefully removed with sterile curettes and paper strips (Periopaper, OraFlow Inc., Smithtown, NY, USA) will be placed in the periodontal pocket until mild resistance is felt for 30s. Care will be taken to avoid mechanical trauma when placing the strips and those strips contaminated with blood will be discarded. Each strip per patient will be stored in a separate 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube, and stored at -70\u00b0C. Prior to use, the proteins on the strips will be eluted into 500\u00b5l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with BSA (1% v/v).\n\n(iii) Plaque Following GCF collection, subgingival plaque will be collected from the designated site. The sampling area will be isolated from saliva, gently dried with air, and after ensuring that no supragingival plaque deposits are present two paper points will be placed for 30s into the periodontal pocket and a pooled sample will be collected. All samples will be stored in Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at -80\u00b0C before processing. Paper points will be used for the collection of microbial plaque in order to avoid mechanical disturbance of the periodontal tissues.\n\nData management The investigators must ensure that the subject's anonymity is maintained. On any study-related documentation, subjects should only be identifiable by their initials, gender, and/or subject number. Personal information (i.e. medical cards) will be kept in a separate, secure location, away from other study specific data with restricted access to the principal investigator only.\n\nInformed consent process It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to obtain in writing consent from the subject. The informed consent form will consist of two separate documents; a Subject Information Form and a Subject Informed Consent Signature Form; both documents will be approved by the Ethical committee of the Dental School, AUTh prior to the study. The subject information form will provide an adequate explanation, in native non-technical language that is understandable to the subject, of the aims, objectives, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. The principal investigator must then provide ample time for the subject to read and understand the informed consent form and to consider participation in the clinical investigation. The principal investigator and the subject must both sign and date the form before the subject can participate in the clinical investigation. Each subject will then be issued with a copy of their duly signed and dated informed consent form and any other written information."

A total of 4 patients will be treated during the course of this study.\n\nA hospital multi disciplinary team will review the medical history and available treatment options for all potential patients and recommend whether they are suitable for the study. Once patients are approved they will enter an 8 week screening period. During this period bone marrow from the patient will be harvested and the manufacturing of the final graft tissue will start. The manufacturing facility will use a cadaveric donated decellularised tracheal scaffold (supplied by the NHS blood and transplant body) and the patients own cells to make the final investigational product (graft).\n\nThe product will be surgically grafted into the patient in place of the damaged tracheal section. The graft will be supported by a stent for the first 6 months with replacements of this stent occurring at week 8 and week 16 post-surgical procedure. Hospitalization for a number of days will be required during this replacement steps. The patient will be followed frequently post surgery to capture any safety and efficacy measures.

                              "Bone injuries represent an important world medical problem producing significant healthcare and societal expenditure. While most bone injuries are not severe and are capable of healing through bone regeneration by natural callus formation with standard treatments, severe bone injuries may not heal, becoming an important unmet clinical need.\n\nNon-unions, or pseudarthrosis, may occur in 5% to 20% of long-bone fractures that fail to heal properly after more than 6 months, with morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased expenses. The most commonly accepted standard augmentation to procure fracture and non-union healing consists of autologous bone grafting, obtained from the same patient in a different surgical site and transplanted to the reconstruction site. However, autologous bone grafting has some drawbacks (such as persistent pain, scar, late recovery, limited amount of bone, etc) and a limited regeneration efficacy (success rate of about 74%) and high societal cost. Culture-expanded autologous MSCs combined with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) biomaterial granules have been claimed as a solid regenerative medicine alternative to autologous bone grafting in non-unions, although current data are limited. In this context, the ORTHOUNION initiative focuses on the opportunity to test the hypothesis of superiority of MSC, the investigational ATMP, versus the currently accepted standard therapy, iliac crest bone autograft to biologically augment surgical treatment of long-bone non-unions."

                              "Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling complex neurological disorder recognized as a complication of migraine in the the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Patients with CM experience headache on 15 days per month. CM is associated with significant disability and reduced health-related quality of life. Approximately 1.3% to 2.4% of the general population suffers from CM, and one in five CM sufferers cannot work because this condition impacts their ability to lead productive lives. CM is frequently complicated by overuse of acute pain medications. Some drugs have regulatory approval for migraine prophylaxis; none are approved specifically for CM prophylaxis although recently, botulinum injection has been FDA approved for CM treatment with marginal treatment effects with many patients failing to have complete remission. The present study is being undertaken as a phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell preparations (MSC) for treatment of CM."

                              "Tendon disorders compromise pain free activity and often progress to chronic pain with a major impact on quality of life. More than 85,000 patients each year see their general practitioner (GP) with Achilles Tendinopathy (AT) which affects the lower leg in young and middle aged adults. The main treatment is physiotherapy, although surgery is eventually considered in 25-45%of patients, an intervention that requires several months of immobilisation and has unpredictable outcomes.\n\nOther treatments include, shockwave therapy, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (a blood injection of platelet rich plasma) and steroid injections, but other than physiotherapy non have been shown to be better than placebo. There is a need for improved nonsurgical treatments. There is an established treatment in horses that involves injection of the horses own stem cells into the tendon, which has been shown to be effective but has never been used in man. We wish to translate the technology to humans and propose a pilot phase II trial to establish the safety of stem cells implanted in diseased human tendon. We aim to study 10 patients with chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy to assess safety as our primary outcome measure. In addition we capture clinical outcomes scores and ultrasound appearances. Other than the stem cell injection, all assessments will be non invasive. Participants will be otherwise healthy adults, aged 18-70 and recruited from routine outpatient clinics at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, presenting with a painful heel, diagnosed by a specialist as Achilles tendinopathy, and having already undergone a minimum of 6 months of physiotherapy. Each participant will have 6 months follow up. This study will help inform a larger clinical trial in the future for which a further ethics application will be made."

                              "When the long blood vessels supplying blood to the arms and legs become blocked (ischemic), patient will experience painful sensations in their calves when they walked which slowly become excruciating painful at rest. When the condition worsens, the patients will not be able to feel any pain from their legs and they will not know if there are any small ulcers or cuts on their legs. As a result, a small ulcer which goes unnoticed becomes bigger and can sometimes become infected. In the worst situations, infection might lead towards gangrene and septicaemia. Severe rest pain and/or ulcerations of ischemic limbs are defined as the state of chronic critical limb ischemia and at this point, amputation of the affected limb is suggested.\n\nConventional treatments include angioplasty/bypass operation to remove blood vessel blockage to restore blood supply, the use of prescribed medicines to aid in ulcer recovery and clear infection and debridement of damaged/infected tissue. Some procedures have to be performed multiple times. Amputation is inevitable in many cases because some blood capillaries cannot be corrected and restenosis of vessels is very common. Cell therapy with mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow is promising because these stem cells are capable of stimulating and regenerating capillaries and blood vessels."

                              "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of efficacy with disease progression.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype, morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.\n\nBM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes' markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals. Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and practical way for PD."

                              "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Ukraine. This will be a Phase I study with the main emphasis on the safety and efficiency profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic disorder resulting in a functional deficit that usually leads to severe and permanent paralysis. Pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies to SCI get limited effect. Another promising therapeutic approaches for SCI is cellular transplantation. Cell types used in SCI therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in SCI treatment.\n\nMSC have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing ,axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression.\n\nThe clinical translation of cellular transplantation strategies requires a safe and efficient means of cellular delivery. In animal models of SCI, the most common delivery is direct injection into the injury site, which allows a defined number of cells to be delivered, but risks further injuring the cord. Less invasive methods for cell delivery have been investigated, including intravascular delivery (intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial) and delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal). These minimally-invasive techniques decrease the risk to the patient and allow delivery of multiple cell doses. Maybe intrathecal administration is superior to IV delivery, cell engraftment and tissue sparing were significantly better after intrathecal delivery, but more researches are needed for get conclusion."

                              "Low back pain (LBP) is the global leading cause of disability, and furthermore rates sixth in terms of overall disease burden, in both developed and developing countries. LPB is a condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age, and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP will increase substantially over coming years.\n\nCurrent LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment. Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.\n\nIn a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby causing biomechanical functional failure.\n\nToday, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this common and debilitating disease.\n\nThe objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years."

The other two groups will receive islets plus autologous bone marrow-MSCs at two different doses (20x10^6/patient, or 50x10^6/patient). The TP-IAT procedure will remain as routinely performed. Patients will be followed for12 months post-transplantation, having 3 follow-up visits scheduled on days 90, 180, and 365 after the transplant. The primary endpoint will be a change in islet function from baseline to 12 months post-transplantation as measured by the C-peptide area under the curve following a mixed meal tolerance test. Potential effects of MSCs on glycemic control, pain relief, quality of life, and adverse events will be evaluated at each follow-up visit."

                              "The general aim of the project is to develop a treatment for severe hoarseness due to vocal fold (VF) scarring. Vocal fold scarring can be caused by tumor surgery, radiotherapy, severe inflammation or is early acquired (sulcus vocalis with scar) and results in stiff vocal folds with decreased vibratory capacity and severe deterioration or total loss of voice (aphonia). There is no lasting effective treatment. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are immunomodulatory, decrease inflammation and improve endogenous healing. After receiving ethical permission the investigators have since 2012 treated 16 patients with manifest vocal fold scarring and severe hoarseness by scar resection and local injection of autologous bone marrow MSC to restore speech. This project was the first in the world to study the effects of MSC treatment of vocal fold scarring in humans. Analysis was made before and up to 12 months post operatively with voice recordings, examination with high speed camera and elasticity measurements of the vocal folds with novel technology. No side effects were found for any patient and for two thirds of the patients with 12 months follow-up the vocal fold function improved and no patient deteriorated.\n\nWhile cell therapy with autologous MSC was classified according to the Tissue Legislation before 2015, it is now regarded as drug treatment. In accordance with this legislation, the MSC production is now full scale GMP. The investigators have recently received permissions from Swedish Medical Product Agency (DNr 5.1-2019-92069) and from the Regional ethic committee (Drn 2019-06160) for an open Phase I/Il study in patients with severe dysphonia and vocal fold scarring to evaluate safety, tolerability and vocal function after surgery with local administration of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell product KI-MSC-PL-204 as an extended study on 15 patients.\n\nMSC may in the future be used to treat patients with severe hoarseness due to scarring, as well as other damages in the airways."

                              "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) are considered the standard of care for many malignancies, such as lymphoma, myeloma and some leukemias, and so on. Graft failure after auto-HSCT is a formidable complication. It occurs in 2-9.5% of patients and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections and hemorrhagic complications. There are various options for the management of graft failure. The most common treatment of graft failure is growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)and recombinant erythropoietin,but it usually effective in the short term and no effect on platelet counts.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and so on.As an important source of hematopoietic stem cell, cord blood has been widely used in clinical practice. It is reported that cord blood combined with MSCs can increase engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, to our knowledge, the report about efficacy of treatment of graft that develops after auto-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor combined with cord blood is absent.If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors or MSCs combined with cord blood in treating patients with graft failure after auto-HSCT."

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

The autologous MSC-NTF cells are back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the muscles.\n\nNTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.\n\nPrevious open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit were also observed in some patients.\n\nThis multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six months at monthly visits."

                              "The standard treatment for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation, however, it has several limitations, including small donor pool, long waiting list, and several complications. Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo controlled trial. After assignment of the written informed consent, thirty six patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be enrolled, and will be randomized by block randomization into treatment or placebo arm. All the enrolled patients will be in the waiting list of liver transplantation. In the treatment arm bone marrow of the patients will be aspirated, and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells will be cultured, and then will be infused through a peripheral vein. Also, the corresponding placebo will be infused for the placebo group. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after performing the procedure."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term survival of transplanted kidneys has not improved accordingly in the last decades. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for many years, due to their efficacy in preventing acute rejection. However, CNI have nephrotoxic side effects that can directly contribute to renal dysfunction and compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently there is a strong interest in immunosuppressive (IS) regimens that maintain efficacy for the prevention of acute rejection, whilst reducing nephrotoxicity.\n\nIn this perspective the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with a mTor inhibitor (Everolimus (Certican\u00ae)) might be an optimal strategy to facilitate CNI (tacrolimus) withdrawal. MSCs have IS properties and roles in tissue repair and everolimus is a proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects. In experimental studies the combination of mTor inhibitor and MSCs was shown to attenuate alloimmune responses and to promote allograft tolerance.\n\nIn total 70 de novo renal recipients, 18-75 years of ages will be recruited from the transplant clinics of the LUMC. Thirty five of these patients will be included in the Certican/ and MSC group and 35 patients in the Certican/ standard dose tacrolimus group. Patients of the MSC treated groups will receive two doses of autologous BM derived MSCs IV, 7 days apart, 6 and 7 weeks after transplantation in combination with Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.). At the time of the second MSC infusion tacrolimus will be withdrawn in 2 weeks (after 1 week dose of tacrolimus will be halved, after 2 weeks stopped). Patients in the control group will receive Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.) and standard dose tacrolimus (through levels 6-8 ng/ml after 6 weeks).\n\nPrimary goal is evaluate whether concentration-controlled Certican\u00ae with MSCs compared to Certican\u00ae with standard tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients reduces fibrosis by quantitative Sirius Red scoring."

Through the coaxial anchor, a needle will be advanced to the middle 1/3 of the disc, and confirmed in two planes (AP and lateral).\n\nOn the day of infusion, MSCs will be transported from the Cellular Therapy Lab to the IR suite in a validated dry shipper. MSCs will be thawed in a 37\u00baC water bath and drawn into 1 ml syringes. Prior to delivery, an aliquot of the infused product will be tested for viability (trypan blue exclusion). Viability must be >70% for cell transplantation. Treatment group one will receive an injection of 1-2 ml of a 2 x 106/ml concentration solution of MSCs and treatment group 2 will 1-2 ml of a 4 x 106/ml concentration solution of MSCs. Both treatment groups will be injected under intermittent fluoroscopic observation. A manometer will be used to monitor disc pressures, especially during MSC injection keeping pressure below 100 psi. Specifically, the volume of injectate will be determined based on three dynamic factors: real time imaging of contained contrast volume during discography, psi as measured during the injection (< 100), and patient's symptoms (if patient's pain exceeds baseline, injection will be stopped) - up to a volume of 2cc of the assigned concentration.\n\nAn aliquot of infused product will be submitted to the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Microbiology Laboratory to test for microbiological contamination. In the event of a positive microbial test following administration of a cellular product: 1) The Principal Investigator and his/her designee will be notified and will notify the participant, 2) The contaminant will identified to a species level and antibiotic sensitivities determined, 3) The Medical Director of the Cellular Therapy Laboratory and/or the Principal Investigator will determine the best course of action based on the clinical situation. This may include blood cultures, administration of prophylactic antibiotics, and repeat cultures on the cell product. 4) An investigation to determine the source of the contamination will be conducted, and appropriate corrective measures will be undertaken. Finally, the adverse event will be reported to the IRB and FDA based on the respective federal and institutional reporting requirement, as well the approved data safety monitoring board charter.\n\nMRI/Quantitative MRI Procedure\n\nRoutine images of the lumbar spine (sagittal and axial T1 and T2 weighted images) will be obtained for the purposes of: Monitoring for potential alternative effects of the cells including osteophyte formation, as well as any unexpected local outcome. In addition, a quantative MRI including fingerprinting. Magnetic resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) allows rapid and simultaneous quantification of T1and T2 relaxation times. The MRF sequence is based on varying multiple MR acquisition parameters [ e.g. flip angle (FA) and time of repetition (TR)] in a pseudorandom manner, such that unique signal evolutions called \"fingerprints\" are generated for each combination of tissue properties. These fingerprints are compared with a dictionary of simulated fingerprints generated for that sequence by a pattern matching process. Once there is a pattern match, the T1 and T2 values used to generate that dictionary entry are assigned to that voxel and used to create T1 and T2 maps that are perfectly anatomically co-registered.\n\nFor spine, the proposed MRF sequence is based on a multislice Fast Imaging with Steady Precession (FISP) acquisition. Scanning will be done both in sagittal and axial planes using a multislice acquisition. The scan parameters are as follows:\n\nFOV: 400 mm, matrix 400 x 400 mm , TR/TE: 13-15 msec, in-plane resolution 1 x 1 mm, section thickness 5 mm, flip angle 5-75 degrees, acquisition time ~ 39 seconds per slice, with ~ 4 minutes scan time for a 5 slice sagittal image. In axial plane, the disc would be covered at each intervertebral level in 4-5 transverse slices and each axial acquisition would take ~ 3 minutes scan time.\n\nThe MRF maps would be directly generated as DICOM images using Gadgetron online reconstruction. Image analysis would be done using a DICOM viewing software to draw Regions of Interest (ROIs) on nucleus pulposus for direct quantification of relaxation times. There is the capacity to generate MRF maps from raw data on Matlab which can also be used to draw ROIs for simultaneous quantification of T1 and T2 relaxation times.\n\nThese values will be calculated on the pre and post treatment MRIs."

Induction therapy with antibody plus the maintenance immunosuppressive agents have greatly improved graft survival in renal transplantation. Since mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s), we evaluate autologous MSCs as an alternative for antibody induction therapy. Moreover, we examine if MSCs could improve the recovery of early function in transplanted kidney."

The patients will undergo lipoaspiration under sterile conditions of the operating theatre, the collected lipoaspirates will be further processed - enzymatically with the use of collagenase or mechanically using the Lipogems system. After collection, lipoaspirates will be immediately transferred to the laboratory of the Department of Regenerative Medicine with a tissue and cells bank in Warsaw, and the preparations will be administered to the patients' knee joints in the operating room under ultrasound control.\n\nThe Lipogems system is defined as a minimal tissue manipulation system. In contrast, the administration of preparations produced using an enzymatic method requires advanced actions.\n\nLipoaspiration will be performed using blind cannulas and vacuum syringes introduced through the abdominal wall with a three-millimetre incision on the skin after previous injection to the adipose tissue with modified Klein's solution (500 ml of saline solution, 1 ml of adrenaline, 40 ml of 2% lignocaine), which makes the collection easier. 10 ml of the collected adipose tissue will be used to examine the samples after previous gradient drainage from Klein's solution. Immediately after collection, the samples will be sent to the laboratory for analysis (cell count testing, culture, phenotype identification, analysis by flow cytometry).\n\nThe patients will be monitored in the hospital outpatient clinic for one year after the procedure; the control visits will take place: after 2 and 6 weeks, then after 3 and 6 months and after a year. A physical examination and the assessment using the KOOS questionnaire will be performed. Before the procedure and after one year, an X-ray and MRI with T-2 Mapping will be carried out in order to evaluate the condition of the cartilage."

Compared to FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity."

In the end, haMPCs are prepared after being purified andamplified to P2-P5. When induced by specific factors, haMPCs have a potential for multilineage differentiation towards bone, cartilage and fat tissue both in vivo and in vitro. The haMPCs can secrete a number of soluble mediators to stimulate the proliferation of endogenous progenitor cells, to act as nutrients, to be immunosuppressive, to be anti-inflammatory, to prevent fibrosis and promote angiogenesis. The cytokines secreted by haMPCs play a synergic role in restoring the dynamic balance of synthesis and decompositon of cartilage tissue, and finally to repair the impaired cartilage."

                              "Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized as hypergonadotropic ovarian failure mostly prevalent before age 40. It is astonishingly frequent and affects around 1% of women below the age of 40. The clinical findings include amenorrhea and abnormally high levels of luteinizing (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The etiology of POF is unidentified in the majority of cases. It can occur due to a combination of genetics, immunological diseases, and environmental factors. POF is characterized by lack of secondary follicles, arrested folliculogenesis, decreased estrogen levels, and female infertility.\n\nCurrently, no available therapeutic intervention has been verified effective in retrieving fertility in patients with POF. Several trials at ovarian stimulation are typically ineffective. Consequently, the diagnosis of POF can cause great physical and emotional distress among patients. Hence, there is serious need to develop innovative treatment plans for POF.\n\nThe latest research shows that reduced ovarian reserve is caused by aging of the niche rather than a defect in germ cell lines. Current scientific evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could repair injured tissues and holds great promise in treating many diseases including male and female infertility.\n\nThe uniqueness of this study is demonstrated in the transplantation of purified specific populations of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into patients with POF without in vitro expansion or culture, with minimal manipulation. Stem cells are withdrawn and transplanted back into the patient on the same day of the procedure, thus presenting the highest safety and efficacy parameters."

Prevalence is estimated to be 8-16% worldwide. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease and usually means that the patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT), which may involve a kidney transplant or a form of dialysis. One of the options in RRT is continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD is characterized by a continuous removal of extracellular fluid by peritoneal membrane. It should be noted that like any other peritoneal dialysis therapy, CAPD has Short or long-term complications and UFF is the most common functional disorder in which the peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damaged.\n\nThis project intends to evaluate, the role of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients who have ultrafiltration failure up to 6 months.\n\nIn this study, 10 male and female subjects who are on peritoneal dialysis for at least two years and have ultrafiltration failure with age range of 18 to 70 years will be enrolled. Patients will be selected from peritoneal dialysis patients attending the peritoneal dialysis ward of Dr. Shariati hospital. The main inclusion criteria is to be on peritoneal dialysis for at least last two years and having Ultrafiltration failure. After obtaining the consent form, a sample of fat tissue will be obtained by a general surgeon under sterilized condition from patients and then in the specialized lab, the mesenchymal stem cells will be separated and cultured to reach appropriate numbers (106/kg). The cells will be injected through peripheral vein in hospital setting. Patients will be followed-up (clinically and laboratory) at baseline and at week 3, week 6, month 3, month 4 and month 6. The clinical assessment and peritoneal function tests will be performed in each visit. Outcome measures: The main outcome measures that periodically will be assessed include: D/P cr, D/P urea, D0/D glucose, PET, KT/V urea, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)"

Each ATCell\u2122 cell line will be created from cells grown from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of a participant's own adipose tissue collected by liposuction, and each treated participant will only receive their own cells.\n\nWithin the treated group, 3 dosing levels will be explored: 50 million cells, 150 million cells, or 300 million cells, and a Placebo group which will receive 5% dextrose lactated Ringer's solution free of cells. Participant follow-ups will take place 1 day following the tissue harvest procedure and, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following ATCell\u2122 treatment. Comprehensive participant's evaluations involving data collection will take place 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment.\n\nIt has been proposed that in general, mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) events need to be taken far more seriously, and that even mild TBI events can result in lasting negative consequences as evidenced by lower performances on neuropsychological assessments when compared with age-matched controls2. In fact, this condition may eventually lead to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which, together may be termed the AD-like dementias3, further underscoring the need for effective clinical intervention. Currently, no effective treatments are available for this condition aside from treatment of the symptoms, although some more comprehensive treatments have been proposed."

                              "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and peripheral CD34 positive cells. Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Singapore. This will be a Phase I/II study with the main emphasis on the safety profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."

                              "Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of disability in the world, affecting all occupational sectors with different incidence rates. It is estimated that 60 percent of all workers suffer from LBP during their careers, 10 percent of which become chronic (The Lancet. September 2017). Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of cases. A key characteristic of IDD is loss of matrix integrity and biomechanical functional failure. Today, no therapy can restore intervertebral disc (IVD) function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. Current therapies are aimed at pain reduction. When these treatments fail, several types of surgery are performed but they are often related to side effects, disturbance of motion and other biomechanical consequences. New strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Encouraging results from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that cell-based regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for LBP. LBP patients treated with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BM-MSC) showed rapid and progressive improvement of functional indexes of 65 percent to 78 percent over 1 year after intradiscal administration without side effect. ACTIVE is an ambitious randomized clinical trial aimed at developing a treatment for IDD based on intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC to improve the quality of life of workers and the disability of patients with LBP. ACTIVE main aim is to generate efficacy and safety profiles of single injections of 15 million cells/mL of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 4 discs) versus sham procedure. The regenerative potential of BM-MSC treatment will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technologies on quarterly basis up to 12 months."

It has been reported that MSCs can suppress maturation, activation and proliferation of T, B, NK and DC cell in vitro and downregulate immune response in vivo. MSCs are presently being cotransplantated with hematopoietic stem cell, which can facilitates engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells and prevent GVHD. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Patients with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body. Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can involve tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas of the body. The origin of autoantibody production in SLE is unclear but a role has been suggested for an antigen driven process, spontaneous B-cell hyper-responsiveness, or impaired immune regulation.\n\nThe BXSB mouse strain spontaneously develops a progressive and lethal autoimmune disease, similar to human SLE. In our previous work we found that transplantation of MSCs could alleviate the symptoms of BXSB mouse.\n\nThis study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of expanded autologous MSC infusions in patients with primary and treatment -refractory SLE. This study will last 2 years. Participants will be assigned to receive either the prednisone (Group 1) or MSC infusions alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study on Day 0. One year post- infusions, Patients will be clinically assessed and evaluated for MSC and disease response, and participants will undergo kidney biopsies at 12 Months."

                              "Different types of stem cells have been used in various ways in several research projects to find the optimal procedure to regenerate the human corneal stroma. It included several approaches which can be classified as intrastromal implantation of stem cells (1) alone, (2) together with a biodegradable scaffold, (3) with a non-biodegradable scaffold, or (4) with a decellularized corneal stromal scaffold. The complex structure of the corneal stroma has not been yet replicated, and there are well-known drawbacks to the use of synthetic scaffold-based designs. Recently, several corneal decellularization techniques have been described, which provide an acellular corneal extracellular matrix (ECM). These scaffolds have gained attention in the last few years. The scaffold provides a more natural environment for the growth and differentiation of cells when compared with synthetic scaffolds. In addition, components of the ECM are generally conserved among species and are tolerated well even by xenogeneic recipients. Keratocytes are essential for remodeling the corneal stroma and for normal epithelial physiology. This highlights the importance of transplanting a cellular substitute together with the structural support (acellular ECM) to undertake these critical functions in corneal homeostasis. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, all attempts to repopulate decellularized corneal scaffolds have used corneal cells, but these cells have major drawbacks that preclude their autologous use in clinical practice (damage of the donor tissue, lack of cells, and inefficient cell subcultures), thus the efforts to find an extraocular source of autologous cells. A recent study by the investigators has shown a perfect bio integration of human decellularized corneal stromal laminas (100 \u00b5m thickness) with and without h-ADASCs colonization inside the rabbit cornea in vivo, without observing any rejection response despite the graft being xenogeneic. The investigators also demonstrated the differentiation of h-ADASCs into functional keratocytes inside these implants in vivo, which then achieved their proper biofunctionalization. According to the investigator's opinion, the transplant of stem cells together with decellularized corneal ECM would be the best technique to effectively restore the thickness of a diseased human cornea, like in keratoconus. Through this technique, and using extraocular mesenchymal stem cells from patients, it is possible to transform allergenic grafts into functional autologous grafts, theoretically avoiding the risk of rejection.\n\nThe process flow is defined as following: (1) the file study: which start by receiving the file of the patient, the file will be forwarded to appointed physicians coordinators for review and submission of medical report, then the medical report will be evaluated within the cell therapy committee and the patient will be asked for clinical examination, and after consultation a reply to the patient with medical decision will follow with an approval or not to be recruited and if yes, a brief report about the procedure will be submitted and explained in details to the patient, a consent form must be signed if the patient agree to be included in the study, (2) the patient admission: which may start by completion of the procedure forms and doing the pre-op evaluation (initial work up defined as a clinical and biological assessment upon C.A.S which may include unaided and best spectacle corrected visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, corneal topography, aberrometry, endothelial cell count (specular microscopy), corneal confocal microscopy, as well as blood tests), all this tests should be effectuated by an specialist and reviewed by an ophthalmologist. Then, a lipoaspiration of the subcutaneous adipose tissue to be performed by a plastic surgeon, sample processing at a cGMP facility for isolation and characterization of the stromal vascular fraction enriched with ADASCs as well as laminas preparing (the quality control assessment will be realized before and after all the steps of the procedure starting from the ADASCs collection to implantation including cell culture, cell quiescence, decellularization of human corneal lamina, recellularization of the laminas with ADASCs, and implantation; the assessment will include cell viability, cell number, cell apoptosis, immunophenotyping, infection, inflammation by analyzing the secreted cytokines from ADASCs, lamina cutting, lamina thickness, immunostaining, confocal microscopy, etc.); (3) the delivery (implantation) which starts by a peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia where the patient is placed under operating microscope, followed by a femtosecond laser-assisted mid-stromal lamellar dissection, then the autologous ADASCs or laminas or recellularized laminas will be placed within the pocket, and finally closed by a superior incision closure. The patient will be put under antibiotic/steroids for a defined period and followed by the team at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months.\n\nThis protocol of cell therapy will be applied exclusively at VISSUM (Alicante-Spain), Barraquer Ophthalmology Center (Barcelona-Spain), Ramon y Cajal Hospital (Madrid-Spain), Asturias Prince Hospital (Madrid-Spain), and Murcia Hospital (Murcia-Spain), in affiliation with Miguel Hernandez of Elche University (Elche-Spain).\n\nThe patient's recruitment will take place: for the lipoaspiration, processing, preparing the cellularized laminas and quality control assessments in VISSUM (Alicante-Spain), Barraquer Ophthalmology Center (Barcelona-Spain), Ramon y Cajal Hospital (Madrid-Spain), and Murcia Hospital (Murcia-Spain). All these steps are managed by VISSUM (Prof. J. ALIO)."

If a patient is discontinued due to a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (i.e. dose-limiting toxicity, DLT), an additional patient will be enrolled at the same dose level to ensure that a minimum of 3 patients are evaluated. If 0/3 patients experience dose-limiting (DLT) at a given dose level, then the dose will be escalated for next cohort of 3 patients. If 1/3 patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If no other patient experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If DLT occurs in 2/3 or 2/6 patients, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be declared the MTD for the MSC cell infusions in this study."

A run-in phase of 2 weeks will be required prior to randomization/enrollment.\n\nAll subjects will receive appropriate and standard care for chronic wounds, including dressings, bandages, and off-loading, if required. All subjects will receive either saline, fibrin or MSCs in fibrin using an identical double-barreled syringe to keep the blind. Therefore, subjects will then be randomized to one of three groups:\n\nconventional standard therapy and control saline spray\nconventional standard therapy and fibrin spray\nconventional standard therapy and MSCs (autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell)in fibrin spray\n\nScreening Visit:\n\nAll inclusion and exclusion information will be reviewed to make sure that the subject is eligible for entry into the study. The following procedures will be performed during this two week period:\n\nBiopsy - One (3 x 6 mm) biopsy will be taken from the edge of the wound for additional diagnostic tests and for culturing of cells. The second (3-4 mm) biopsy will be taken from the thigh for culturing of cells in the laboratory to assess the healing process. The thigh biopsy will then be excised by taking about 3/4 inch long by 1/4 inch wide margin from around it, and suturing it closed. The reason for this biopsy of the normal skin is so that it can be used to compare the healing process to the chronic wound.\n\nBlood Sampling - Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing to assess the overall well-being, HIV, Hepatitis B & C and if the subject is a woman able to bear children, to test for pregnancy.\n\nWound Measurements - Wound measurements will be taken to determine the size of the wound and to assess for healing.\n\nRandomization Visit:\n\nIf the wound has not reduced significantly in size, and the subject is still eligible for the study; he/she will be assigned to a study treatment. The decision as to which treatment he/she will receive will be determined by a process called randomization. Randomization is a mathematical process used to guarantee that each participant in the study has an equal chance of being assigned to any of the treatment options available.\n\nThe treatment groups that the subject may be assigned to are as follows:\n\nGroup #1 - Conventional Therapy and Control Saline Spray -The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically normal saline to the wound. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days).\n\nGroup #2 -Conventional Therapy and Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography, and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically fibrin alone to the wound. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days).\n\nGroup #3 - Conventional Therapy and Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in fibrin. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if your wound is not healed.\n\nConventional Therapy - The subject will receive standard of care and accepted conventional therapy, regardless of which of the three groups you will be randomized in. This standard of care involves the use of dressings, bandages and protective ways to increase healing of your wound.\n\nBone Marrow Aspirate - Depending on the treatment group that the subject is assigned to, they will have either a bone marrow aspirate and/or sham (imitation) aspirate performed at this visit.\n\nDay 1 Treatment Visit:\n\nAll groups will receive the study treatment that was assigned at the randomization visit. Wound measurements, clinical observations, wound dressings, adverse event reporting and photography will be performed.\n\nWeekly Follow-up Visits (Weeks 1-24):\n\nAll groups will return weekly for conventional therapy, wound measurements, clinical observations, wound dressing changes, adverse event report, and photography. Two additional study treatments will be given at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if the wound is not healed.\n\nPost-Treatment Follow-up Visit (Week 28):\n\nAll groups will return one month after 24 weeks of treatment for evaluation, wound measurements, and photography.\n\nFollow-up wound Biopsies:\n\nParticipants in all three study treatment groups will be asked to have an additional biopsy of the wound edge at Week 6. This biopsy will only be taken if the wound has not healed."

We plan to include approximately 40 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction as a research object, and conduct a randomized, single-blind, parallel-controlled multi-center clinical trial. The patients were randomly divided into a BM-MSCs group and a control group, and were given the best drug treatment and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary study endpoint was the change in myocardial metabolic activity 6 months after autologous BM-MSCs transplantation and the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 12 months; The incidence of adverse events. The above indexes were evaluated by cardiac color echocardiography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)."

Fifteen adult patients with refractory, rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. If the participant is not currently diverted, then participants will undergo a laparoscopic diversion with a loop ileostomy. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The participants will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.\n\nParticipants will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified participants will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessed. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug. Participants will return on: Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104."

                              "BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage repair in the knee is aimed at young patients with area(s) of cartilage loss and no deformity of the knee. These patients aren't indicated for a knee replacement. Articular cartilage repair leads to improvement of symptoms of pain, locking and function. Traditionally, articular cartilage repair has always involved exposing the entire knee joint with an arthrotomy. This, though effective, would lead to a large scar, longer hospital stay, longer rehabilitation and its associated complications. Also, the use of Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells (BMAC) for the purpose of cartilage repair has long been debated with both sides having valid arguments and good surgical results.\n\nRATIONALE: Both procedures in this study are performed in one stage, arthroscopically and as day case procedures, which offers minimal scarring and quicker recovery. This automatically confers a significant advantage over the traditional surgical techniques.\n\nTo correct the articular cartilage defect, the ACIC method requires autologous Atellocollagen (a protein based structure), while the MCIC method uses concentrated BMAC taken from the patient's iliac crest.\n\nBoth procedures have shown encouraging results in terms of pain relief, cartilage growth and improved function. Since one technique utilises a protein based reagent and the other involves mesenchymal cells, this study aims to ascertain if either technique is superior to the other.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: This study aims to compare two techniques of articular cartilage repair in the knee, namely Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC) and Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis (MCIC). The principal objective of is to ascertain and assess the superiority, if any, of either surgical technique over the other. The superiority will be assessed with by the certain scoring systems (IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm and MOCART) measured pre- and post-operatively.\n\nDepending on which procedure the patient chooses to have, they will be allotted to either the ACIC or the MCIC group. The patient is followed up in the clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery and their progress is documented by questionnaires and clinical examination. MRI scans are done at one and two years to assess the extent of cartilage growth.\n\nSURGICAL TECHNIQUES\n\nAutologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC):\n\nACIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure. It is done as a day case? procedure and the patient is admitted a few hours before the procedure. The anaesthetic method depends is the Anaesthesiologist's prerogative and depends on the patient's general health. Under sterile conditions in an operating theatre, the arthroscopic instruments are introduced inside the knee joint. As assessed previously by MRI scans, the area of cartilage defect is debrided by curettage, shaving and burring and then microfractured. The ACIC method utilises autologous Atellocollagen, a protein based structure, mixed with thrombin and fibrinogen to form a gel which coats the area with a cartilage defect. The entry ports are then closed and the knee is covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is transferred to the surgical recovery ward and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the ward.\n\nAfter discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the operated leg for 6 weeks after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy. Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.\n\nMesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis (MCIC):\n\nMCIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure.

                              "In this study, investigators aimed to transplant autologous, adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells to the patients with liver cirrhosis. Investigators also aimed to assess liver tissue regeneration, downgrade of clinical findings and antiviral efficacy. Finally investigators aimed to establish an alternative treatment modality to liver transplantation.\n\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) which can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important health problem especially in western countries. In 5% - 25 of patients with chronic HCV hepatitis who are nonresponders to current medical treatment, liver cirrhosis develops. Approximately 1/3 of patients with liver cirrhosis become decompensate in 10 years. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C, However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Some very recent studies emphasize the antiviral effects of MSCs. The reasons for choosing this study title is; no available medical treatment for the non-responder cirrhotic patients, shortage of organ donors, patients rapidly progressing to transplantation candidates, and patients dying while they are in waiting lists and finally hopeful data regarding MSC applications. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies.\n\nIn this study autologous adipose tissue derived MSCs will be transplanted to patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C. After invitro expansion, patients will receive 1 million cells per kg. via peripheral vein every week for 3 times. Also via hepatic artery, 3 million cells per kg will be infused for 3 times in every 2 weeks. With this protocol, investigators aimed to increase liver regeneration, decrease in liver fibrosis, increase the waiting time of patients in transplantation lists and finally to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by pathology examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations."

                              "Lower limbs arteries are a frequent localization of atheroma in elderly people (15-20% after 70 years). The most severe stage of the disease, critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined clinically by the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer, has a dramatic prognosis at 12 months, with 30% of the patients alive with an amputation, 20% mortality and only 20% of patients with a resolved disease, independently from the treatment. The only validated treatment for this disease is revascularization by endovascular procedures or open surgery. Patients with no option or poor option (high risk) for revascularization have the worst prognosis.\n\nCurrent research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide revascularization and oxygenation of the tissues. A specific form of stem cells, called Adipose-derived Stem/Stroma Cells (ASC), has shown promise for recovering from ischemic disease like critical limb ischemia (CLI) in preclinical trial and trial in phase I. This study will confirm the efficacy autologous transplantation of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal cells in patients with critical limb ischemia with poor options or no option for revascularization.\n\nThis study is a phase II, prospective, multicentric, open trial and no comparative. A maximum of 43 patients will be included in two-stage to receive 90*106 intramuscular injection of ASC. Patients will be followed-up for 6 months.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the number of patients alive without major amputation and without critical limb ischemia (defined as the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer and ankle pressures less than 70 mmHg or toe systolic pressure less than 50 mmHg or TcPO2 of less than 30 mmHg, at six month).\n\nThe secondary endpoints are to evaluate:\n\nthe number of new vessels in the treated limb by standardized angiographic magnetic resonance\nthe blood flow by laser Doppler, transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2), ankle pressure\nthe percentage reduction of wound surface and percentage of complete ulcer healing\nthe pain reduction by standardized evaluation (visual scale and drug consumption)\nthe percentage of wound infection and irritative dermatitis (expected adverse events)\ninterleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-12, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03b1)measurements in blood samples\nMesenchymal stem cells MSC trophic factors and immune- modulators (Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), Human Leucocyte Antigen G (HLA-G)) in vitro."

                              "Articular cartilage injuries in the knee continue to grow in number as detection and treatment options have advanced. Treatment options, including microfracture, autologous chondrocyte (cells that make cartilage) implantation, osteochondral grafting and meniscus transplantation can hopefully deter the progression of degeneration and have promise to function as disease modifying solutions. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) has emerged as a preferred method of treating large focal chondral defects as it structurally replaces the cartilage and often involved sub-chondral bone with native hyaline cartilage and bone. The results of OCA are successful with greater than 85% survival at 5-year follow-up. Failure can occur due to a lack of boney integration or low chondrocyte viability. Therefore, anything to enhance the graft augmentation process may be useful in preventing failure. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study is to determine the effect of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) containing bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on improving graft incorporation and preventing failure. The effect of BMAC on the graft and intra-articular knee environment will be evaluated using 3 techniques: computed tomography (CT) imaging, synovial fluid cytokine analysis, and serum biomarker analysis. Information learned from this study can be used to biochemically compare treatment response and to assess emerging therapeutic options that may positively alter the biochemical environment in patients undergoing osteochondral allograft transplantation."

                              "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in swollen and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen after rest. Most frequently, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. RA affects between 0.5-1% of adults in the developed world with between 5-50 per 100,000 people newly developing the disease each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning and quality of life.\n\nHerein, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the immunomodulatory effects of bone marrow-derived stem cells administered intravenously and the regenerative and repair potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells transplanted into the joints of patients with RA."

                              "Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is generally considered a non-medically manageable cause of male infertility. These patients, who constitute up to 10% of all infertile men, have abnormal spermatogenesis as the cause of their azoospermia. The etiology affecting approximately 60% of azoospermic men, includes non-obstructive causes of azoospermia, including toxic exposures or abnormal testicular development. NOA results from either primary testicular failure (elevated Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), small testes affecting up to 10% of men presenting with infertility), secondary testicular failure (congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with decreased LH and FSH, small testes), or incomplete or ambiguous testicular failure (either increased FSH and normal volume testes, normal FSH and small testes, or normal FSH and normal testis volume). Prior to microsurgical testicular sperm retrieval techniques and IVF/ICSI, donor insemination was the only option available to men with NOA. The establishment of in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a standard treatment modality has resulted in a number of these men successfully fathering a child through surgically retrieved sperm from the testis. The challenge, however, is to improve their spermatogenic function to enable the appearance of sperm in their ejaculate or to improve the chances of a successful retrieval from the testis for ICSI.\n\nThe initial evaluation aims at resolving the following issues: (1) confirming azoospermia, (2) differentiating obstructive from non-obstructive etiology, (3) assessing for the presence of reversible factors and (4) evaluating for the presence of genetic abnormalities. An elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level or an absence of normal spermatogenesis by testicular histology in the presence of azoospermia is generally considered sufficient evidence of a non-obstructive etiology. The most common reversible factors that need to be ruled out include recent exogenous hormone administration, severe febrile illnesses, chemotherapy/radiation or prolonged antibiotic use.\n\nDuring past few years a considerable progress in the derivation of male germ cells from pluripotent stem cells has been made. These studies provide a desirable experimental model for elucidating underlying molecular mechanism of male germ cell development and potential strategies for producing haploid germ cells for the treatment of male infertility. Spermatogenesis is a complex process by which spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) self-renew and differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. In mammals, this process takes place in the seminiferous tubules of testis, which provide a functional niche for male germ cells and involve three major stages: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Errors at any stage of spermatogenesis can result in subfertility and infertility.\n\nResearchers are currently developing alternative treatment options for these men involving stem cells. It has been verified that mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can form functional spermatozoa. Functional assays have shown that spermatozoa generated from iPSCs were capable of fertilizing the oocytes after intracytoplasmatic injection and giving rise to fertile offspring following embryo transfer. So far, functional male gametes from human iPSCs have not been obtained.\n\nThere are two possible approaches in generating of male germ cells from pluripotent stem cells: in vitro differentiation into advanced, haploid cell products or combined in vitro differentiation and in vivo transplantation. However, the originality of this study is illustrated in the transplantation of purified autologous CD34+/CD133+ and mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) into infertile patients without in vitro breeding, culture, or manipulation thus avoiding in vitro cell propagation risks as genetic mutations and DNA changes. The cells are withdrawn and injected back into the patient on the very same day of the procedure, hence conferring the highest safety and efficacy parameters."

The investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation. The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae, Astellas Pharma), and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will receive basiliximab (Simulect\u00ae, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.\n\nUp to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30 days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a 2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90 days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.\n\nThe study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials."

                              "Treatment of nonunion, delayed union and malunion fractures of long bones remains problematic. The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third and sixth month after the fracture. Nonunion is a serious complication of a fracture, occurring in 2-10% of patients, as it is associated with high economic and health burden. Many cases are subsequently approached by multiple surgical and nonsurgical modalities. Various devices, under the name of \"bone growth stimulators\" have been used to enhance healing of the fracture. Recent studies, demonstrated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in regeneration of bone and cartilage tissue. In this study percutaneous injection of mesenchymal stem cells to the site of fracture is performed as an outpatient procedure or during an operative exposure to evaluate its efficacy in enhancing bone regeneration. In the case of small size of bone gap, mesenchymal stem cells are injected into the callus of fracture site through an outpatient procedure under the guide of fluoroscopy. If there is a large bone gap, through a surgical management, mesenchymal stem cells seeded on bone matrix are placed at the site of fracture. Patients are followed by X-Ray examination 1,2,6, and 12 months after treatment."

                              "Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. During the last decade, treatments for heart failure have evolved, but their purpose is to improve symptoms and prevent aggravation of the disease. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide trophic and paracrine support or even replace dying cells with new ones. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. These cells are known for their ability to secrete paracrine factors and their immunosuppressive properties. The MESAMI 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of MSCs injection directly into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people with chronic ischemic heart failure using NOGA-XP system.\n\nThis phase 2 study is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 90 patients will be randomized in 2 arms to receive intramyocardial injection of MSCs or placebo. Patients will be followed up for 13 months. Bone marrow will be collected and immediately transported to the French Blood Establishment for MSC isolation and expansion. Patients will receive intramyocardial injection of MSCs or placebo during a left heart catheterization."

Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group. Kidneys from the same donor of DCD will be random allocated to intervention group and control group. In intervention group the investigators will collect SVF from recipients with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of DCD kidney transplantation during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. The investigators will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in DCD kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of autologous SVF derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival, improving allograft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, the investigators will assess the percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis within one week), and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities."

                              "Introduction\n\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common and devastating injury among young athletes, and re-injury poses significant threats to both successful return to play and long term outcomes. Graft healing during ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a slow biologic process, that involves graft incorporation into bone tunnel sites, as well as intra-articular graft remodeling . The intra-articular graft remodeling process is known as ligamentization, and occurs in three phases after ACLR. The first phase of early healing occurs between 0 and three months, the second phase occurs between 6 months and one year, and the final phase of maturation occurs after 1 year when the graft appears very similar to the native ACL. The studies that defined these time points biopsied human bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) ACL autografts at different postoperative points, and described changes occurring over time in regards to vascularization, cellular aspects, and appearance of the extracellular matrix in comparison to control ACLs . Unlike animal models which display a necrotic stage, grafts in human models undergo an early vascular invasion, associated with fibroblasts that are converted to a hyper-cellular matrix with only focalized areas of necrosis . This process occurs as early as 3 weeks postoperatively, and increases over time as areas similar to the native patellar tendon with mature collagen and metabolically quiescent cells decrease . This process is the limiting factor in graft healing for bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) grafts, as osteointegration occurs earlier .\n\nThe processes of osteointegration and ligamentization are responses to the new intrasynovial milieu and physical forces that the new graft is exposed to. During these healing and restructuring processes, failure load and stiffness of grafts decreases by up to 24% at 7 weeks, before strengthening to their potential . This contributes to the long recovery period for ACLR, and the risk of re-rupture during this period. Advances in biologic adjuncts to accelerate and improve this healing process would have a significant impact on the management of ACL injuries.\n\nRecently, biologic preparations of various growth factors have been developed to safely and effectively treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including tendinopathies and arthritis . Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) consists of undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells that are concentrated and applied to the injury site . Previous studies have demonstrated this treatment to offer the pluripotent potential of the cells to impact healing, regeneration, biomechanical strength, and reducing bone-tunnel enlargement . Investigators have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell reinforced grafts had a significantly higher failure load and stiffness as early as 8 week post-operation in a rabbit model, suggesting an added benefit of advanced healing . Using BMSCs can offer a novel method to enhance tendon graft osteointegration. While there have been numerous laboratory studies researching the effect of mesenchymal stem cells, there lacks evidence in translation to the clinical setting. Silva et al performed a study where they injected bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) into patellar tendon grafts to examine for increased graft-to-bone tunnel integration. They did not find a significant difference of tunnel integration on MRI imaging, but they did not examine the intra-articular portions for the effect on the ligamentization process, nor did they examine the effect on clinical examination and patient reported outcomes .\n\nQuantitative MRI is a non-invasive method to interrogate tissue properties and evaluate the biochemical composition of tissues. The T2* sequence gives information regarding tissue graft volume, water content, fiber alignment, and tissue density. Median grayscale values (a measure to determine tissue quality)can also be correlated to maximum failure load, yield load, and linear stiffness of grafts in a porcine model. Increases in MRI signals in ACL grafts have been found to be time dependent, becoming well established by three months, particularly at the distal intra-articular portion near the tibial tunnel . These changes have not been shown previously to be predictive of graft failure, but Investigators have recently also confirmed that normalized T2* signal intensity values of ACL grafts have significant correlation with knee instability related to ligamentization and tunnel healing.\n\nA recent study examined intra-articular graft maturation after platelet-rich plasma gel (PRPG) application, with MRI at month intervals from 3-12 months postoperatively. The intra-articular segment was divided in a proximal, middle, and distal segment, on a scale from 0-3 ranging from completely homogenous to severely heterogeneous. The mean time to obtain completely homogenous bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) graft was 109 days for the PRPG group, and 363 for the control group 8.\n\nWe propose using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T2* mapping to investigate if BMAC treatment at time of ACL reconstruction can accelerate the graft maturation and healing process. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft evaluating the T2* weighted MRI changes of the graft at 3 and 9 months after surgical reconstruction. Additionally, we will obtain patient-reported outcome measures from this cohort to evaluate if BMAC treatment imparts a clinically-significant effect on ACL reconstruction.\n\nStudy Rationale\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of biologic augmentation of ACL reconstruction with BMSCs as measured by magnetic resonance imaging to detect graft healing and integration. Secondary endpoints will include validated patient reported outcome measures, as well as functional outcome using objective examination findings.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe hypotheses of this study are that there will be improved graft healing and integration at three and nine months as measured by decreased signal intensity and heterogeneity on T2* MRI following administration of BMAC during ACL reconstruction compared to the control group. Additionally, patient reported outcomes and physical examination findings will be significantly improved at an earlier time in those who receive the BMAC treatment to their allograft compared to the control group.\n\nStudy Plan\n\nThis study will be a prospective randomized trial of patients undergoing arthroscopic reconstruction of full thickness anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. All patients who sign consent and undergo full thickness ACL reconstruction will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment will continue until 32 patients, 16 in each group, are enrolled. Follow-up will take place at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 24 months."

Group B; including 25 patients, will undergo the tension-free vaginal tape operation. The sample size is determined according to the following equation:\n\n[ P1( 100-P1) + P2( 100-P2) ] / (P2 - P1)2 where; Power of the test = 80% Confidence level = 95% Alpha error = 5% Assuming success rate for the preferably used intervention \"tension-free vaginal tape\" in patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency P1=80% ( Schierlitz et al, 2008).\n\nAssuming success rate for stem cell therapy P2= 90% ( Smaldone et al, 2009).\n\n** Intervention:\n\nConsent Informed consent will be taken according to World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki; the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\nHistory Full medical history will be taken from each patient, together with detailed history as regards voiding habits, incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urinary infection. Questionnaire about incontinence, & questionnaire about quality of life will be obtained.\nExamination Complete physical and pelvic examination to evaluate the presence of stress urinary incontinence, & to exclude patients with marked hypermobility of the urethra, or severe cystocele or rectocele.\nUrodynamic study A multi-channel urodynamic study using Euet Sensik \u00ae will be performed including cystometry, urethral pressure measurement, abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) measurement, & residual urine measurement. Patients with stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency will be selected. Criteria for selection are: absence of involuntary contractions during leakage caused by a stress maneuver; low ALPP (<60 cmH2O); & maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) <20-30 cmH2O. Patients with voiding dysfunction will be excluded (residual urine volume >100ml).\n\nCells retrieval, culture, & processing:\n\n* Bone marrow aspiration:\n\n-Site: posterior superior iliac crest.\n\n-Procedure: The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with the top leg flexed and the lower leg straight. The iliac crest is palpated, and the preferred sampling site is marked with a pen. Aseptic technique is employed, including sterile gloves and gown. The site is prepared with an antiseptic (povidone-iodine), scrubbed, and draped, exposing only the site to be sampled. The skin and the underlying tissue to the periosteum are infiltrated with a local anaesthetic (approximately 10 mL of 1% Xylocaine [lidocaine]). A 10-mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle is used to inject an initial 0.5 mL directly under the skin, raising a wheal. A 22-gauge needle is used to penetrate deeper into the subcutaneous tissue and the underlying periosteum, an area roughly 1 cm in diameter. A skin incision is made with a small surgical blade, through which the bone marrow aspiration needle, with a stylet locked in place, is inserted. Once the needle contacts the bone, it is advanced by slowly rotating clockwise and counter clockwise until the cortical bone is penetrated and the marrow cavity is entered. The depth of the penetration should not extend beyond an initial 1cm. Once within the marrow cavity, the stylet is removed. Using a 20 mL syringe, approximately 5 mL of bone marrow are aspirated. Subsequent specimens are obtained by attaching a separate syringe, collecting 5 mL at a time. The samples are then transferred into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -containing tube. The marrow needle is removed, and pressure is applied to the aspiration site with gauze until any bleeding stops.\n\n* Cells processing & culture:\n\n- Mononuclear cells (MNCs) will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficol/Hypaque.\n\n- Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be isolated through plastic adherence by the seeding of MNCs in T25 tissue culture flasks in complete culture media (DMEM, 1% antibiotics/antifungal, 20% autologous serum). Flasks will be incubated at 37\u00baC in CO2 incubator for 3-5 days.\n\n- After 5 days, flasks will be evaluated under inverted microscope for the number and morphology of MSCs. Non-adherent cells will be discarded and medium replenished.\n\n- Half of the medium will be changed every 3 days.\n\n- Flasks will be evaluated until cells reach about 80-90% confluence.\n\nMSCs will be harvested using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 5 minutes. Afterwards, trypsin action will be stopped by the addition of autologous serum.\nMSCs will be washed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), counted, tested for viability using trypan blue exclusion test.\nMSC will be identified using immunophenotypic markers (positive for CD44 and negative for CD34).\nCells will be suspended in sterile saline, a minimum of 20 X 106 MSCs cells in a 10 cc syringe, ready for injection.\n\nQuality control check for the sterility by the performance of bacterial aerobic and anaerobic cultures will be done to ensure the complete aseptic conditions during the specimen retrieval, preparation, storage, and injection. (Gunetti et al., 2012)\n\nInjection of cells:\n\nThe patient will be placed in lithotomy position. A Foley's catheter (size 18) will be inserted in the urethra, then under local anaesthesia; retrieved cells (total 20- 30 million cells per patient in 10cc syringe) (Sebe et al., 2011) will be injected into the submucosal tissue at the level of the proximal urethra just distal to the bladder neck (guided by stretch on the Foley's catheter), at 3,9,12 o'clock, injecting around 3.5 cc in each site.\n\nTension-free vaginal tape (TVT):\n\nAnother 25 patients will undergo surgical intervention, which is the \"tension-free vaginal tape\" operation at the obstetrics & gynecology department - Ain Shams Maternity Hospital - urogynecology unit. In this technique, a small midurethral incision will be made in the vaginal mucosa, then a polypropylene 40*1cm mesh tape attached to two curved trocars will be passed lateral to the urethra & through the endopelvic fascia into the retropubic space. The trocar will then be passed along the back of the pubic bone, through the rectus fascia, in two small suprapubic skin incisions, then the tension on the tape adjusted & the remaining tape cut off at the level of the skin.\n\nFollow up:\n\nFollow up visits will be conducted at 3months, 6months, 9months, and 12months after therapy. Clinical examination, incontinence questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire, & urodynamic study will be done.\n\n** Data collection & recording:\n\nEach patient will have a case record form (CRF) in which the following data will be recorded:\n\nAge, parity\nBody mass index (BMI).\nType of intervention (stem cell therapy or TVT)\nInternational Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\nIncontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) Instrument Score on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\nCough test on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\n\nUrodynamic study on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nDescriptive statistics for measured variables will be expressed as range, mean and standard deviation (for metric data); range, median and interquartile range (for discrete data); and number and proportions (for categorical data). Pre-injection & post-injection findings will be compared using the t-test or the Wilcoxon test depending on whether the measured parameters were Gaussian variables. A P-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant.\n\n** Ethical considerations:\n\nDelegation of investigator responsibilities:\n\nThe investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately informed about the protocol, & their trial-related duties and functions. The investigator will maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified person to whom he or she has delegated significant trial-related duties.\n\nPatient information and informed consent Before being admitted to the clinical study, the patient must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to her. An informed consent document, in Arabic language, contains all locally required elements and specifies who informed the patient. After reading the informed consent document, the patient must give consent in writing. The patient's consent must be confirmed at the time of consent by the personally dated signature of the patient and by the personally dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. If the patient is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written informed consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence of an impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by the personally dated signature of the patient or by a local legally recognized alternative (e.g., the patient's thumbprint or mark). The witness and the person conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the consent document. The original signed consent document will be retained by the investigator. The investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.\nConfidentiality Only the patient number and patient initials will be recorded in the CRF, and if the patients name appears on any other document, it must be kept in privacy by the investigators. The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be identified.\nProtocol approval Before the beginning of the study and in accordance with the local regulation followed, the protocol and all corresponding documents will be declared for ethical and research approval by the council of ob/gyn department, Ain Shams University; according to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki."

                              "MES-HT is a phase 1-2 multicenter pilot prospective study conducted on 14 heart transplant patients who developed severe coronary vasculopathy, in the aim to assess the effect on myocardial perfusion of the intramyocardial administration by percutaneous way of autologous mesenchymal stem cells derived from the bone marrow.\n\nThe main objective is to show improvement in myocardial perfusion in a non-randomized and uncontrolled pilot study, before considering a randomized controlled study. The administration of intra myocardial cells using the NOGA system was carried out to date with more than 1,000 patients and is considered feasible and safe. However, the investigators will assess very carefully the feasibility and safety of this invasive approach.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the improvement of myocardial perfusion measured by MRI after endomyocardial injection of mesenchymal cells by percutaneous way, guided by the NOGA system.\n\nThe secondary endpoints are the feasibility and safety of this administration, changes in ejection fraction measured by contrast echocardiography, changes in other MRI cardiac parameters (left ventricular volumes , intramyocardial fibrosis), the oxygen consumption during exercise, myocardial perfusion measured by SPECT. Other secondary endpoints are the evolution of the immune status, and histological criteria of myocardial biopsy.\n\nOnce the mapping performed, preparation is injected through another catheter (MYOSTAR injection catheter) which will also be guided by the Noga\u00ae system. This catheter may be positioned on the regions of interest (viable ischemic areas) and allow the injection of the quantity of CSM (40 million / ml) in 10 to 12 different injection points and injection volumes 0.3 ml for a total dose of 120 to 144 million cells.\n\nAfter each injection procedure, patients are monitored for 48 hours minimum clinically and under continuous ECG monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. A troponin dosage is done after 6 H, and after 24 and 48 hours. An echocardiogram is performed immediately after the procedure and before the release to 48 H.\n\nA clinical evaluation will be made after the patient is discharged at 1 month (clinical examination + Holter + echocardiography), 3 months (examination), 6 months (clinical examination, Holter, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, test of effort with measurement of VO2, effort myocardial tomoscintigraphy and for patients from Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, Rubidium 82 by positron emission tomography) and 12 months (examination). Myocardial biopsy and a control coronary angiography will be only performed within 12 months in accordance with the practice of the teams.\n\nPatients will benefit from a biological monitoring which provides for the monitoring of immune response. This immuno-monitoring is to assess the possible influence of the injection of mesenchymal cells on immunological tolerance mechanisms. It will be implemented in the balance sheets of cardiac tissue at the waning annual biopsies and peripheral blood samples on inclusion, 48 hours after injection and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe limiting toxicity is defined as the occurrence at one month of a serious adverse effect related to the protocol , requiring an hospitalization or being able to be life-threatening , or like abundant pericardial effusion requiring pericardial drainage, bleeding complications requiring blood cell transfusion or surgery, stroke constituted, sepsis or septic shock, cardiogenic shock, severe ventricular rhythm refractory death.\n\nAll patients are followed for one year."

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the knee that affects millions of adults throughout the world and is the leading cause of disability. It is a degenerative type of arthritis that occurs most often in patients, as the cartilage in the knee joint gradually wears away. As the cartilage wears away, it becomes frayed and rough, and the protective space between the bones decreases. This can result in bone rubbing on bone and produce painful bone spurs. The patient experiences pain that worsens over time.\n\nAlthough current surgical therapeutic procedures to cartilage repair are clinically useful, they cannot restore a normal articular surface, and in many cases, resulted in the growth of inferior quality fibrocartilage. Therefore, techniques and practices have been developed to collect minimally manipulated bone marrow aspirate (BMA), that contains Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMDMSCs) and other endogenous acellular components, from knee OA patients for autologous transplantation in the treatment of their knee OA.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to study arms to receive a BMA injection to the intra-articular knee, subchondral knee, both intra-articular and subchondral knee, or to receive a corticosteroid injection to the knee. A corticosteroid injection is currently the standard of care for osteoarthritis patients having knee pain. All participants will undergo a procedure. Participants will be blinded as to whether they receive a BMA injection or a corticosteroid injection."

This study will enroll patients that have persistent symptomatic perianal disease despite being treated with an MSC coated fistula plug, and also treat patients that have had recurrence of their perianal fistula.\n\nAs per the previously approval treatment under IND 15356, patients will have a single affected fistula treated, which is the same fistula that was treated in the original protocol. The matrix for delivering the cells is a Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug.\n\nSubjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified subjects will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessment will be made if an EUA is clinically necessary to assess the fistula. As this is a re-treatment trial, patients with incomplete response to initial plug placement typically have close follow up, recent MRI imaging, and may have a seton in place. If an EUA is clinically indicated, this would be by a colorectal surgeon for drainage of sepsis and placement of a seton as part of the standard clinical care for perianal fistula.\n\nPatients will return on: Day 1, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24."

                              "Patients selection:\n\nIn this clinical trial, investigators considered therapeutic effect of MSCs in SM-exposed male patients.Patients, had a documented encounter with SM during the Iran-Iraq war. The patients signed informed consent before study. They were selected according to the following criteria: (a) the severity of lung injury was ranged from moderate 50< forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <65 to severe 40<FEV1<50; (b) absence of contraindications spirometry (hemoptysis, cerebral arterial aneurysm or aortic, pulmonary embolism, uncontrolled blood pressure, recent pneumothorax, no doubt surgery/thoracic recent, recent stroke); and (c) no coagulation. The exclusion criteria for the selection process were as follow: (a) participate in another study at the same time; (b) smoking habitat; (c) the existence of pneumonia during the study; (d) the incidence of transfusion reaction; (e) underlying other diseases (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes).\n\nIsolation and culture of adipose derived stem cells:\n\n200mL of abdominal adipose tissue was obtained under local anesthesia by liposuction aspirates protocol. The lipoaspirate was washed with PBS to remove tissue debris. 100mL PBS containing 0.1% w/v collagenase A type I was added to isolated tissue and then incubated at 37\u00baC for 60 minutes. Collagenase activity was neutralized using MEM medium along with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium after centrifugation at 2000rpm for 10 min, and then transferred to culture flasks for 72 h at 37\u00baC in 5% CO2 condition. The culture medium in the flasks was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged for two times.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis:\n\nTo analyze the cell surface antigen expression, 5\u00d7105 fresh cells from third passage were harvested by trypsin-EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 1 min, resuspended in stain buffer (PBS, 2% FBS) and then incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Trypsin was neutralized by centrifuge and isolated cells were washed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in stain buffer. Cells were incubated in dark environment for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cells were labeled with anti-human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugated to fluorochromes. These antibodies were as follow: anti-CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD73-phycoerythrin (PE), CD11b-FITC, CD34-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD45-PE, CD105-PE. The frequencies of all immunolabeled cells were analyzed by FACS Canto II flow cytometer, in which approximately 500,000 events were assessed and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0).\n\nKaryotype analysis for abnormalities detection:\n\nStandard Giemsa staining procedure was performed and chromosome preparations were obtained from 80% confluent cells. To stop microtubule formation, the cells were treated with Colcemid solution. The mitotic arrested cells were then harvested using trypsin-EDTA. The cells were extracted and then immersed in 75 mmol/l KCl for 30 minute at laboratory temperature. Finally, they obtained by a centrifugation. The supernatant was replaced with fixative solution and the suspension was spread over slides for microscopic examination and imaging. At least, 15 metaphase spreads were analyzed. The karyotypes were considered with light microscope using a cytovision software.\n\nFreezing and Storage of Adipose-derived Stem Cells:\n\nADMSCs were harvested at 90% confluence before injection for freezing. To collect cells, culture medium was removed and replaced with sterile PBS and after three minutes it was replaced with trypsin-EDTA solution and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Complete medium (MEM with 10% FBS) was added to inactivate the trypsin, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in cryopreservation medium (80% FBS, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 10% MEM medium) with a final concentration of 5 million cells per milliliter and aliquoted into cryovials. The vials stored at -80 \u00b0C overnight and then transferred into a liquid nitrogen container for long-term storage.\n\nMSCs injection and Study plan:\n\nPatients received 100\u00d7106 cells every 20 day for four injections within 2 months and screened for 7 times. MSCs were injected intravenously along with 300 ml normal saline to the patient at a maximum rate of 2\u00d7106 cells/min. Each infusion took approximately 30 minute to be completed. After each injection, patient stayed at hospital for at least 6h as recovery time. Efficacy of MSCs treatment in these patients were evaluated using the following parameters: pulmonary functions test (PFTs) [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC], total lung capacity by body plethysmography, single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (CO diffusion) , exercise performance [6-minute walk test (6MWT)], Borg scale dyspnea assessment (BSDA), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SRGQ) and comprehensive safety evaluation."

                              "Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.\n\nThe most popular form of autologous MSC therapy has been through the use of autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate (MSCs, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a \"healing\" effect on the environment in which it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\n\nAdipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of MSCs versus that in bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known as stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.\n\nAlthough the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and \"dose\" have not been performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized study arms with different types of MSCs (bone marrow derived MSC, adipose derived MSC, and umbilical cord tissue MSC) and then will be further randomized to receive an injection of the MSC type they were initially assigned to or corticosteroid. Participants randomized to bone marrow derived MSC or adipose derived MSC will undergo a procedure (bone marrow aspiration or liposuction). Participants will be blinded to whether they receive the MSC or corticosteroid injection."

For bone reconstruction purposes, human MSCs have been seeded and cultured on porous calcium phosphate ceramics in osteogenic media. Some clinical studies with low numbers of patients have been reported using this approach but the outcomes were inconsistent with low efficacy in bone regeneration. The reasons of the limited clinical success may be due to several bottlenecks in the multidisciplinary field of bone tissue engineering. The association in vitro of biomaterials and osteoprogenitor cells raises technical challenges and regulatory and ethic issues for the implementation of clinical trials, whereas the expansion of MSCs is now possible in GMP Facility.\n\nThe expected results are to obtain bone consolidation thus healing of delayed union or non-union, as proven by imaging techniques, without using bone graft. This will prove the efficacy of the proposed IMP based on pluripotent MSCs expanded in a GMP facility and mixed with granulated biphasic calcium phosphate in the surgical setting before implantation. No expected complications related to the procedure are expected. Changes in serum levels of bone turnover markers will be described."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from adult tissues. These are characterized in vitro by their extensive proliferative ability in an uncommitted state while retaining the potential to differentiate along various lineages of mesenchymal origin, including chondrocyte, osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages, in response to appropriate stimuli.MSCs can be induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Centeno et al.in 2008 reported about the beneficial effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis of knee. The regenerative effects of MSCs in osteoarthritis can be due to their ability to differentiate themselves into chondrocytes and structurally repair the articular cartilage. Recently, MSCs have been shown to possess many potent paracrine effects through secretion of various soluble factors which can influence the local tissue environment and exert protective effects with an end result of effectively stimulating regeneration in situ. Recently Amgad etal.in their study reported even more effective results with use of platelet rich plasma along with mesenchymal stem cells. Platelets play an instrumental role in the normal healing response via the localsecretion of growth factors and recruitment of reparative cells. Its use in orthopaedic began early in this decade as PRP was used with bone grafts to augment spinal fusion and fracture healing.\n\nWakitani et al. in 1994 described repair of defects in articular cartilage in rabbits.Murphy et al.studied the effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in caprine knee joints.Quarto et al.reported the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to repair a large musculoskeletal defect with successful healing of a large bone defect in three patients. Centeno et al. reported one case in which they showed that isolated and expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells when percutaneously injected into a knee with symptomatic and radiographic osteoarthritis, resulted in significant cartilage growth, decreased pain and increased joint mobility. Mishra et al. reported that PRP could enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, and that TGFbeta and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which are factors present within PRP, were important for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs.Hence present study is designed to study the efficacy of use of PRP enhanced mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis knee.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of Platelet rich plasma enhanced autologous mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet rich plasma in knee osteoarthritis.\nTo correlate the clinical improvement with the radiological findings."

Several studies have shown that the immune system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and umbilical-cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via its immunomodulatory properties have the potential to improve insulin resistance condition and pancreatic beta-cells dysfunction thus improve the glycemic control and insulin requirement in T2D patients. In this pilot study, we plan to recruit 15 T2D patients with total daily dose of insulin >= 0.5 unit/kgBW/day to receive BM-MNCs (5 subjects) or UC-MSCs injections (10 subjects).

                              "Introduction:\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disease of alarmingly increasing prevalence (8 - 16%) associated with mortality [1]. CKD can progress towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring renal replacement therapy. ESRD currently accounts for 6.3% of the Medicare spending in the United States, and is projected to increase by 85% by 2015 [2]. In a study conducted among rural population in Bangladesh overall CKD prevalence was found about 19% [3]. Furthermore, ESRD has a major impact on quality of life and life expectancy [4]. Therefore, it is very important to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent, alleviate, or decelerate progression of renal failure.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and hypertension represent major causes of CKD and initiation of dialysis [5]. In addition, glomerular diseases, malnutrition, infectious diseases, and acute kidney injury may lead to ESRD, contributing to the increased global burden of death [6]. Current treatment modalities often fail to target the major underlying contributors for progression of renal disease [7]. Management of CKD at present mostly aims at control of the predisposing factors and supplementation of kidneys homeostatic functions but not at the treatment of the diseased kidney itself. Again due to lack of adequate facilities or financial constraints people of a developing country like Bangladesh are unable to continue long term or lifelong dialysis. Chronic glomerular and tubule-interstitial fibrosis is a common pathway to ESRD, often associated with apoptosis, oxidative damage, fibrosis and microvascular rarefaction. Unfortunately, the regenerative potential of kidney is limited under chronic conditions and inefficient to prevent progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubule-interstitial fibrosis [8]. Treatment strategies that boost cellular regeneration might therefore offer good alternatives for patients with CKD.\n\nStromal vascular fraction (SVF):\n\nSVF of adipose tissue is a rich source of pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), endothelial progenitor cell, T cells, B cells, mast cells as well as adipose tissue macrophages [9,10]. SVF is a component of the lipo-aspirate obtained from liposuction of subcutaneous tissue. Lipo-aspirate contains a large population of stem cells called adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), which share a number of similarities with bone marrow stem cells, including the capacity for multilineage differentiation .\n\nStem Cells:\n\nA stem cell is a generic term referring to any unspecialized cell that is capable of long-term self-renewal through cell division but that can be induced to differentiate into a specialized, functional cell. Stem cells are generally two types, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Adult stem cells can be obtained from many differentiated tissues including bone marrow, bone, fat, and muscle etc. Obtaining adult stem cells also does not raise any ethical concerns [11]. For most studies, the adult stem cell in question is actually a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cell. They are multipotent but not pluripotent, which means they can differentiate into some, or \"multiple,\" but not all tissue types [11]. Stem cells that are harvested from the patient with the intention of administering them back to the same patient are termed autologous MSCs. MSC can also be isolated from the bone marrow (bmMSC), peripheral blood, connective tissue, skeletal muscle, dental pulp (dpMSC), umbilical cord wall (ucMSC), umbilical cord blood (cbMSC), amniotic fluid (afMSC) and all have been used in experimental settings to treat various types of renal diseases. An important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival [12].\n\nAdvantages of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs):\n\nADSCs are somatic stem cell population contained in fat tissue and have been shown to possess stem cell properties such as trans-differentiation and self-renewal [13]. Similar to other types of MSCs, ADSCs express multiple CD marker antigens (CD73+CD90+CD105+ CD34+/- CD11b- CD104b- CD19- CD31- CD45- SMA-) [14,15]. Additionally, utilizing ADSCs is advantageous in that large quantities of stem cells are easily isolated using minimally invasive surgical procedures [16].\n\nADSCs are vascular precursor cells. Many studies have shown that SVF contains progenitor cells that are able to differentiate into endothelial cells and participate in blood vessel formation [17]. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that SVF cells expressing both pericyte and mesenchymal markers reside in a peri-endothelial location and stabilize endothelial networks [17] Another study showed that ADSCs transplanted into an ischemic renal cortex preferentially migrate toward micro vessels where they differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells [18]. Some trials on kidney transplant recipients as well as the one on FSGS and 2 on CKD patients include in their protocol the utilization of adMSC. Adipose tissue is an important source of MSC, with a frequency 100 to 1000 times higher than bmMSC. They also seem to possess a higher potential for angiogenesis or vasculogenesis [19].\n\nKidney disease and mesenchymal stem cells:\n\nA number of different types of cells from the bone marrow have been tested in animals and in clinical studies for potential use in kidney disease. Amongst all the cells under investigation, MSCs have shown the most promising results to date as they help kidney cells to grow, inhibit cell death and encouraging the kidney's own stem cells to repair kidney damage [20].\n\nFew clinical trials have tested safety and efficacy of MSCs for renal disease. Reinders and colleagues studied safety and feasibility in six kidney allograft recipients who received two intravenous infusions of expanded autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs [21]. Importantly, delivery of autologous MSCs was not associated with adverse events, nor did it compromise graft survival. Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the therapeutic potential of autologous and allogeneic MSCs for treatment of renal diseases [22] Administration of both bmMSC and adMSC has demonstrated significant reno-protective effects including reduction of intrarenal inflammatory infiltrate, decreased fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis [12] MSCs possess unique immunomodulatory properties that ameliorate inflammation and immune responses, constituting a promising tool to facilitate renal repair. In recent years, experimental studies have uncovered the potential of MSCs to improve renal function in several models of CKD, and several clinical studies have indicated their safety and efficacy in CKD [22].\n\nADSCs could be incorporated into damaged tissues or organs which could give rise to new functional components and also exert potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, or immunomodulation effects through paracrine or autocrine routes (via vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, stromal-derived factor-1alpha and hepatocyte growth factor) [23,24]. Interestingly, it is proposed that even apoptotic or dying ADSCs exhibit distinctive immunosuppressive properties [25]. ADSCs have been shown to possess stronger anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating functions than bone marrow derived MSCs [26].\n\nVillanueva et al. explored the effect of ADSCs on CKD by a single intravenous infusion of ADSCs on a nephrectomy induced CKD model of rats [27]. ADSC treatment was associated with reduced plasma creatinine, higher levels of epitheliogenic and angiogenic proteins, and improved renal function. Work by Hyun et al [28] illustrated the beneficial effects of ADSCs on improving renal function on a IgAN mouse model. Zhang et al. [30] found that repeated systemic administration of ADSCs attenuated proteinuria, glomerulus hypertrophy, and tubular interstitial injury in a DN rat model [29].\n\nCurrently, several Clinical trials have been uploaded in the NIH database, all aim to test mainly the safety of using MSC and their efficacy in treating CKD. Two of them propose the use of autologous bmMSC and two adMSC. A study conducted in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, which was designed to provide confirmation of Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in CKD. There 18 months safety and efficacy of autologous MSC as a therapy for CKD total of 10 patients were conducted with I/V injection of high dose of 2x106/kg of autologous MSC. Assessments were performed at 1,3,6,12 and 18 months after cell injections [30].\n\nAnother study conducted in Birmingham, Alabama, Rochester, Minnesota, Jackson, Mississippi, USA where stem cell product called \"Mesenchymal stem cell\" grown from person's own fat tissue infused back in to the patient's own kidney and primary outcome measured after 3 months where renal tissue oxygenation increased and decrease in kidney inflammation was seen as secondary outcome [31].\n\nRoute of delivery:\n\nVarious routes for delivery of ADSCs, ADSC-induced cells, or ADSCs combined with compound materials have been developed for the treatment of different diseases or damaged tissue. These routes can be classified into two categories: systemic delivery through blood vessels (intravenous injection or intra-arterial injection) or local delivery directly into injured tissues or organs [32] The route of MSC delivery may influence the cells' capacity to home and engraft the damaged tissue, and thereby their efficacy for renal repair. Commonly used experimental methods to deliver MSCs include systemic intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal delivery. In nonhuman primates the cells distribute broadly into the kidneys, skin, lung, thymus, and liver with estimated levels of engraftment ranging from 0.1 to 2.7% [33].\n\nThe route of MSC delivery, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal, may affect their efficiency for kidney repair. When labeled MSC intravenously infused into baboons were observed for 9-21 months, estimated levels of engraftment in the kidney, lung, liver, thymus, and skin ranged from 0.1-2.7% [34] Indeed, the intravenous route lags in delivery efficiency, because MSC may initially be trapped in the lungs. Intra-arterial infusion of MSC was the most effective route to achieve immunomodulation in rat kidney transplantation, possibly by avoiding lodging in the pulmonary circulation, allowing MSC to home to the injured kidney [35].\n\nAn important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival. By secreting proangiogenic and trophic factors, injected MSCs not only can enhance proliferation, but also can decrease apoptosis of tubular cells [36]. Several routes of administration (intra-parenchymal, sub-capsular, intravenous) have been explored and all seem to be effective. Multiple, repeated injections of MSCs appear to be even more effective than single injections [37,38].\n\nMethodology:\n\nA Prospective study from April 2019 onwards (Approximately Five years or till completion of sample requirements with minimum one year of follow up) will be conducted in Bangladesh LASER & Cell Surgery Institute & Hospital , Dhaka. 31 Patients of CKD who fulfill the selection criteria and admitted at the selected health care facility for treatment will be included in the study. SVF (stromal vascular fraction) will be collected from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Subsequent processing ( Incubation, centrifugation, mixing, washing & neutralization ) will produce final viable & active SVF (ADSCs) cell which will be transfused intravenously. Considering the possibility of further damage of the already damaging or damaged kidney during angiography and placement of catheter into the renal artery, the investigators opt for intra-venous transfusion of the SVF. Before transfusion sample will be collected & cell counting will be done using automated fluorescent cell counter."

This study will use MSCs that are harvested from the bone marrow and grown for up to 52 days before being given back to the person from whom they were harvested. This avoids any chemotherapy so is therefore safer than other types of stem cells. In this crossover study, everyone will receive their own stem cells back but in half of the patients it will be delayed by 24 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcomes are to check that the procedure is safe and to measure any changes on the MRI at 24 weeks.

                              "Glenohumeral arthritis is one of the main reasons for persistent shoulder pain and reduced movement (range of motion, ROM) as it can compromise the work activity and also the normal daily activities, leading to the development of depressive syndromes. The final treatment is shoulder arthroplasty, which is effective but is associated with significant costs and morbidity rates. In addition, arthro-prosthesis is avoided in young patients due to longevity concerns and is not indicated in the early stages of arthritis. Currently, conservative treatments for patients with mild or moderate glenohumeral arthritis include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections, with low efficacy and a significant adverse effect profile, hyaluronic acid infiltrations, with good efficacy in initial treatment, and infiltrations of platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), which have shown beneficial effects in knee arthritis. However, evidence for the glenohumeral joint are limited. In cases not responsive to conservative therapy, and especially in young patients, a valid alternative to the prosthesis is the arthroscopic treatment, with good results in the short term, but with relatively high failure rates that increase over time. Other types of nonprosthetic surgical treatment for chondral-humeral defects have low scientific evidence, with variable and uncertain results. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue, due to the ability to differentiate into chondrogenic line cells, have emerged as cells with great therapeutic potential in patients with degenerative joint disorders. Since the knee joint is the most susceptible to pathology because of its mechanical load, most studies based on stem cell therapy regard the knee joint, reporting promising results in treatment in the treatment of early stages of arthritis. As regards the glenohumeral joint, since the most frequent pathology affects the tendons of the rotator cuff, almost all studies investigate the effect of MSC in the treatment of rotator cuff disorders with or without associated surgical repair techniques. Only a prospective study analyzed the effect of intra-articular MSC injection derived from bone marrow in 34 patients with isolated glenohumeral arthritis, reporting a significant decrease in pain and an improvement in shoulder function measured by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale at about 1 year, although study quality is very low. Since the use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow has proved effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis, our study proposes to evaluate the long-term efficacy of this type of therapy in the treatment of the isolated glenohumeral arthritis."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that affects the articular cartilage over time and is accompanied by alterations to the synovium, subchondral bone, ligaments, and menisci, as well as hypertrophy of the joint capsule.\n\nTherapies are typically palliative and only alleviate pain in a symptomatic way, failing to stop cartilage degeneration and the following breakdown of other joint structures Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to tackle the challenge of creating OA-modifying therapeutics. The potential of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose derived stromal cells fraction also known as stromal vascular fraction has recently being evaluated for chondroprotective efficacy in oa knees.\n\nThe present study was taken to evaluate Clinical Effectiveness without any doubt after administration of Non enzymatically processed adipose derived stromal cells along with platelet rich plasma in large number (140 patients) having moderate to severe knee (stage 3 and 4) with objective MRI assessment and 2 year follow up.\n\nMethods\n\nThe selection criteria included patients 50 years of age or older with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee that was defined by daily pain for the previous three months, analgesic use at least once per week, less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness, and a WOMAC score of 75 in the target knee. Grades 3 and 4 kellergen Radiographic Grading Scale of Osteoarthritis were part of the radiographic qualifying requirements. The exclusion criteria included individuals with clinically significant systemic diseases and patients with evidence of secondary knee osteoarthritis or severe osteoarthritis (joint space width-JSW 2 mm).\n\nThe WOMAC score, developed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities, is a commonly used indicator of patients' subjective ratings of pain, joint mobility, and physical impairment. With 5, 2, and 17 questions, respectively, it assesses three dimensions: pain, stiffness, and physical function. A minimum score is 0, highest score is 96. The maximum score for each subscale is 20, 8, or 68, correspondingly .\n\nIn order to measure the six-minute walking distance (6MWD), a 50 m distance was marked in an internal hallway, and participants were instructed to walk as far and as rapidly as they could during the course of six minutes. The whole distance was calculated and noted.\n\nUsing previously described procedures, antero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were taken with patients standing at a distance of 1 m from the X-Ray source, with the knee completely extended. The joint space width was measured at its narrowest point (minimal JSW). According to a prior publication this trend was indicated by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm over the trial.\n\nAntero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were acquired using the previously described techniques while patients stood 1 m away from the X-Ray source with their knees fully extended. At the joint space's narrowest point, the breadth was measured (minimal JSW). This tendency was shown by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm during the study, in accordance with a previous publication.\n\nPatients were instructed to take etoricoxib at a dose of no more than 90 mg BD after meals if their discomfort was intolerable. They were instructed to take 30 mg of codeine as needed if the discomfort persisted and to report the next day. Aside from any symptoms or indications that the patient reported, laboratory-based hematological and biochemical tests were also performed as part of the tolerance and safety evaluations.\n\nA microscopic examination of the synovial fluid was performed at baseline and two years after the surgery to check for abnormal cell counts. According to the degree to which they interfered with the subject's everyday activities, adverse occurrences were classified as isolated, intermittent, or chronic. The possible causal association between the supplement and the outcome was categorized as Definite/Possible/Probable/Non-Assessable/None. The institutional committee for stem cell research and therapy gave its approval to the project. All of the patients provided written consent to participate in the trial after receiving enough information.\n\nSVF preparation :\n\nWith the help of a 3 mm aspiration cannula and tumescent solution, about 100 ml of fat was collected from each patient's belly and put into sterile, disposable 250 ml conical centrifuge tubes. The adipose tissue underwent two PBS washes before being sonically cavitated by ultrasound at 10 mega hertz ,50 W for 30 minutes with 5-minute intervals of agitation. The SVF was then extracted as a pellet by dividing the suspension into four 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuging them at 500 g for five minutes. To get rid of any remaining enzyme, the pellet was washed twice with regular saline before being resuspended in PBS. The SVF suspension was spun at 500 g for 5 min after being filtered using a 100 m cell strainer. The extra fluid was dumped. The pellet was put back together with regular saline and passed through a 40 m cell strainer. Samples were collected in order to count the number of cells, assess their vitality, and cultivate, and define the stem cells.\n\nPRP preparation: The same donor who provided the adipose tissue's peripheral blood also provided the platelet-rich plasma. ACD Solution A was added to BD yellow top vacuum tubes with 20 ml of peripheral blood, and the tubes were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. To obtain a platelet pellet, the plasma fraction was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. After that, just 3 ml of plasma remained, which was used to resuspend the platelets."

Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group. In interventional group we will collect SVF from recipients with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of living-relative kidney transplantation during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. We will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in living-relative donor kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of autologous SVF derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival, improving allograft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, we will assess the percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis within one week), and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities."

Screening will include a physical exam, blood draw, pregnancy test, questions about medical history, current medications, and alcohol or drug use, an electrocardiogram (ECG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart, questionnaires, an echocardiogram and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Eligible participants will then undergo two baseline visits within 6 weeks of their scheduled surgery. Baseline Visit 1 will consist of vital sign measurements, a bone marrow aspiration to obtain MSCs and a blood draw for a biomarker test. Baseline Visit 2 will include treadmill test, 6-minute walk test, pulmonary function (FEV1) study and a 48 Hour Ambulatory ECG. After the second baseline visit, participants will be assigned randomly to receive either MSCs or placebo after surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery, once all of the bypass grafts have been placed, a high or low dose of MSCs or placebo will be injected into a damaged area of the heart that did not receive a bypass graft. After receiving the injections, participants will remain in the hospital for up to 7 days. During this stay, participants will undergo a daily blood draw, urine test, ECG, and ambulatory ECG monitoring for the first 96 hours after surgery.\n\nUpon being discharged, participants will return for monthly visits for 6 months and for follow-up visits 12 and 18 months after surgery. These visits will repeat most initial screening and baseline tests. There will be one additional visit 14 days after surgery, which will include questions about side effects, a physical exam, and a 48-hour ambulatory ECG."

It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

Glushchenko; Rahayev AM [2,3] is not doubted.\n\nSeveral studies have shown the efficacy of stem cells in promoting faster and superior wound healing. Alexaki [4] successfully used adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in wound healing in mice and compared their effect with dermal fibroblasts. The application of stem cells in wounds promoted more efficient reepithelialization by their proliferative effect on keratinocytes.\n\nIn recent years, the world's leading burn centers attempted to restore the skin over large areas of burn wounds by epidermal layers transplantation of allogeneic cells cultured in culture medium.\n\nThe information expected in the study will be based on the principles of evidence-based medicine and will have practical significance for the treatment of burn wounds.\n\nIt is expected to show a positive effect of cultured multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in the epithelization of burn wounds process as well as the extent and speed healing of skin flap during autologous skin grafting."

                              "Contour deformities of the face requiring soft tissue augmentation often result from conditions such as congenital disorders, acquired diseases, and traumatic and developmental deformities. Significant contour deformity of face causes both functional as well as aesthetic problems for the patient. Conventionally, these problems are treated by allogenic fillers, major flap surgery and fat grafting.1 However; different problems are associated with above mentioned treatment options. For example, allogenic fillers are foreign material that poses not only allergic reactions but also rapid absorption at the site of application. Similarly, flap surgery, in the form of pedicled and free flaps, produces considerable donor site morbidity. In addition, fine- tuning is impossible with flap, and tissue transferred in the form of flap may act as blob.\n\nAutologous fat grafting has gained pervasive acceptance for the management of contour deformities of the face. Fat being an autologous tissue source is considered as an ideal soft-tissue filler because it is abundant, readily available, inexpensive, host compatible, and can be harvested easily and repeatedly.2 Although the practice of fat grafting is not new and it is a safe and natural method of soft-tissue augmentation, the viability and reliability of transplanted fat grafts remains poorly studied. One major concern is the lack of consistency of final clinical outcome, which often requires multiple fat grafting procedures making it expensive. Rate of fat absorption may reach up to 40% to 80%.However, previously published data have failed to produce a cohesive algorithm of the required components for successful, consistent and durable fat transplantation.3 In order to overcome problems associated with fat grafting, other innovative techniques are required.\n\nThe role of fat auto-transplantation in plastic surgery has evolved from a controversial technique designed for simple volume augmentation to the foundation for the innovative and burgeoning field of regenerative medicine. This is based on the fact that adipose tissue contains adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) consisting of multiple cell types such as circulating blood cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Adipocytes account for 20 percent or fewer of the total number of cells in adipose tissue4whereasthere are only 3% MSCs in SVF of adipose tissue.5 Although this percentage is relatively low, this cell type is the main contributor in overall healing process. MSCs derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) have high proliferative potential and ability to differentiate into mesenchymal (adipose, bone, cartilage) and non-mesenchymal (neuron like cells) lineages.6,7,8 AT-MSCs have been shown to enhance angiogenesis, decrease apoptosis and modify the local inflammatory response owing to their immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory properties.9 Therefore, the current study is designed to evaluate the effect of fat grafting and AT-MSCs together on contour deformities of face. By combining traditional fat graft with AT-MSCs, tissue viability and therefore the consistency of graft survival may be improved. In the current model investigators propose that transferred fat may act as a natural scaffold and temporary filler to restore the volume immediately while AT-MSCs will start participating in multiple parameters of tissue regeneration. This model supports the \"host replacement theory\" that has been put forward to describe how fat grafts survive after they are transplanted.10 Due to problems associated with fat grafting alone, it is desirable to solve such issues by using innovating techniques. In the current study investigators propose the novel idea of enrichment of conventional fat graft with ex-vivo expanded AT-MSCs to enhance the viability of the grafted fat and the reliability of the final outcome of surgery. Recent animal studies have suggested that AT-MSCs that have been expanded before administration could help preserve grafted fat and improve outcomes.11 Thus rationale of current study is to compare the outcome of conventional fat grafting with stem cell enriched fat grafting for contour deformities of face. If enrichment of fat graft with AT-MSCs can decrease its absorption rate, this innovative strategy can make fat transfer a reliable option for soft tissue augmentation. This can definitely improve final clinical outcome at lesser cost and reduced donor site morbidity"

                              "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable disease of unknown etiology that in a short time leads to significant impairment of motor functions and death. The frequency of ALS is 4-8/100 000. Mostly it affects people between 40 and 70 years old, but it can occur at a younger age. Since the symptom onset is most frequently in the fifth or sixth decade, ALS is a huge economic burden for the society. There are many studies conducted to treat the disease and prevent it, but currently the medicine offers only one drug that can slow the appearance of disease symptoms but could not stop the progression. Yet, improvements in medical management, including nutrition and breathing, regularly increase patient survival - 50% of affected patients live at least 3 or more years after diagnosis; 20% live 5 years or more; and up to 10% will survive more than 10 years. The stem-cell-based therapies could be therefore a new waited strategy for ALS clinical treatment.\n\nSince the clinical course of ALS may vary substantially between patients, we are planning to qualify them with a primarily established clinical course based on a detailed anamnesis and clinical assessment. The goal of our nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal regenerative cells (ADRC) transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In order to select a group of 30 ALS patients for the ADRC treatment, approximately 50 ALS patients will be examined. All patients enrolled will have a documented at least 3-months clinical and electrophisiological observation of ALS disease course prior to study enrollment. Each patient will recive 3 injections of ADRC every 3 months: an intraspinal injection followed by 2 subsequent intrathecal infusions. Safety, adverse events and efficacy will be confirmed by clinical, elecrophisiological ( EMG, MUNIX), neuroimmaging and spirometry together with functional (ALSFRS-R) and objective motor assesment (MRC and dynamometer)."

                              "Chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is a public health problem that entails high rates of morbidity and mortality, and enormous costs for health systems worldwide. In the United States there are 5 million people living with CHF, and each year 60.000 people reach terminal phases of the disease, with mortality rates of 70-80% at two years. Although the first cause of CHF in developed countries is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents almost half of the cases of newly diagnosed CHF. Treatment of CHF includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, including implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy and heart transplantation. Despite all these advances, CHF prognosis remains poor. Cardiac stem cell therapy emerged more than ten years ago as a new hope for CHF patients.\n\nAlthough the most extensive evidence of the benefits of stem cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases refers to ischemic heart disease (CAD), initial experiences with stem cells for other conditions such as DCM are encouraging.\n\nThis randomized clinical trial will include 70 patients with DCM, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 20% and 45%, and who are symptomatic in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III/IV. In a first-in-man pilot phase, 10 patients will be treated with transendocardial injections of bone marrow-derived MSCs after cardiac catheterization and NOGA XPTM mapping of the left ventricle. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will analyse the safety and feasibility of this first phase of the trial, and then 60 patients more will be randomized to receive MSCs or placebo (ratio 3:1).\n\nPrimary objectives include safety and feasibility variables, and secondary objectives include efficacy variables. All patients will be studied with a complete cardiac imaging protocol that includes: electrocardiography, echocardiography, treadmill tests with oxygen consumption, holter, laboratory analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), electromechanical mapping (NOGA XPTM) and quality of life questionnaires."

                              "Different types of stem cells have been used in various ways in several research projects in order to find the optimal procedure to regenerate the human corneal stroma. It included several approaches which can be classified as intrastromal implantation of stem cells (1) alone, (2) together with a biodegradable scaffold, (3) with a non-biodegradable scaffold, or (4) with a decellularized corneal stromal scaffold. In fact, the complex structure of the corneal stroma has not been yet replicated, and there are well known drawbacks to the use of synthetic scaffold-based designs. Recently, several corneal decellularization techniques have been described, which provide an acellular corneal extracellular matrix (ECM). These scaffolds have gained attention in the last few years as they provide a more natural environment for the growth and differentiation of cells when compared with synthetic scaffolds. In addition, components of the ECM are generally conserved among species and are tolerated well even by xenogeneic recipients. Keratocytes are essential for remodeling the corneal stroma and for normal epithelial physiology. This highlights the importance of transplanting a cellular substitute together with the structural support (acellular ECM) to undertake these critical functions in corneal homeostasis. To the best of the investigators knowledge, all attempts to repopulate decellularized corneal scaffolds have used corneal cells, but these cells have major drawbacks that preclude their autologous use in clinical practice (damage of the donor tissue, lack of cells and inefficient cell subcultures), thus the efforts to find an extraocular source of autologous cells. A recent study by the investigators has shown a perfect biointegration of human decellularized corneal stromal sheets (100\u00b5m thickness) with and without h-ADASC colonization inside the rabbit cornea in vivo, without observing any rejection response despite the graft being xenogeneic. The investigators also demonstrated the differentiation of h-ADASCs into functional keratocytes inside these implants in vivo, which then achieved their proper biofunctionalization. According to the investigator's opinion the transplant of stem cells together with decellularized corneal ECM would be the best technique to effectively restore the thickness of a diseased human cornea, like in keratoconus. Through this technique, and using extraocular mesenchymal stem cells from patients, it is possible to transform allergenic grafts into functional autologous grafts, theoretically avoiding the risk of rejection.\n\nThe process flow is defined as following: (1) the file study: which start by receiving the file of the patient, the file will be forwarded to appointed physicians coordinators for review and submission of medical report, then the medical report will be evaluated within the cell therapy committee and the patient will be asked for clinical examination, and after consultation a reply to the patient with medical decision will follow with an approval or not to be recruited and if yes, a brief report about the procedure will be submitted and explained in details to the patient, a consent form must be signed if the patient agree to be included in the study, (2) the patient admission: which may start by completion of the procedure forms and doing the pre-op evaluation (initial work up defined as a clinical and biological assessment upon C.A.S which may include unaided and best spectacle corrected visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, corneal topography, aberrometry, endothelial cell count (specular microscopy) as well as blood tests) by an ophthalmologist, followed by lipoaspiration of the subcutaneous adipose tissue to be performed by a plastic surgeon, then sample processing at a cGMP facility for isolation and characterization of the stromal vascular fraction enriched with ADAS as well as laminas preparing (the quality control assessment will be realized before and after all the steps of the procedure starting from the ADAS collection to transplantation including cell culture, cell quiescence, decellularization of human corneal lamina, recellularization of the laminas with ADAS, and transplantation; the assessment will include cell viability, cell number, cell apoptosis, immunophenotyping, infection, inflammation by analyzing the secreted cytokines from ADAS, lamina cutting, lamina thickness, immunostaining, confocal microscopy, etc.); (3) the delivery (transplantation) which starts by a peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia where the patient is placed under operating microscope, followed by a femtosecond laser assisted mid-stromal lamellar dissection, then the ADAS or laminas or recellularized laminas will be placed within the pocket, and finally closed by a superior incision closure. The patient will be putted under antibiotic/steroids for a defined period and followed by the team at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.\n\nThis protocol of cell therapy will be applied exclusively at Laser Vision (Hazmieh-Lebanon) and prepared at Reviva Regenerative Medicine Center in affiliation with VISSUM (Alicante-Spain) and Optica General (Saida-Lebanon).\n\nThe patient's recruitment will take place: for the lipoaspiration, processing, preparing the celluraized laminas and quality control assessments, at the Middle East Institute of Health the Reviva Center (Bsalim-Lebanon) under the regulations of the hospital and the Reviva Center; for injection, at Laser vision (Hazmieh-Lebanon); and for follow-up, at Laser vision & optica general. All these steps are managed by VISSUM (Prof. J. ALIO)."

There are no effective therapies to treat secondary brain injury and the post-injury response of CNS apoptosis and neuroinflammation. Pre-clinical and Phase I clinical progenitor cell therapies have shown promise in TBI/stroke via (1) promotion of CNS structural preservation, and (2) reducing the neuroinflammatory response to injury.\n\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, Bayesian CRM dose-escalation placebo-controlled study designed to treat severe, acute TBI in adult patients with an IV infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells. 55 adult TBI patients will be randomized to receive a single IV infusion of BMMNs (6 x 10^6 or 9 x 10^6) or placebo.\n\nStudy subjects will be consecutive admissions of adults with severe TBI meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adults, ages 18-55 years, hospitalized at Memorial Hermann Hospital (Houston, Texas) for severe TBI (GCS 3-8) will be screened for eligibility. Informed consent, the bone marrow/sham harvest, and stem cell/placebo infusion must take place within 48 hours of the initial injury.\n\nFollowing consent and baseline procedures, subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio (using permuted blocks and stratified by GCS of 3-4 or 5-8) to autologous BMMNC infusion (n=33) and placebo (n = 22), respectively. Administration will begin with the lowest dose (i.e. 6 x 10^6 cells/kg body weight) with each dose given to cohorts of 3 subjects treated with BMMNC (note: the cohort size refers only to subjects treated with autologous BMMNC). After each cohort of 3 subjects treated with autologous BMMNC infusion (accumulated on average after every 5.5 adults randomized), the dosage for the next cohort of 3 autologous BMMNC-treated subjects will be determined by the CRM based on the findings for all subjects previously treated and the prior probabilities of the likelihood of toxicity assigned by the investigators before starting the study. At all doses, the algorithm is designed to avoid administering doses that will have a p(toxicity) exceeding 0.15.\n\nSubjects will be monitored closely for infusion related toxicity and complications during the first 14 days post-infusion while also receiving the usual standard of care for traumatic brain injury . Safety and outcome assessments will be performed at 1, 6, and 12 months post-injury study visits."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage organ failure. Despite dramatic improvements in short-term survival, long-term survival of renal allografts has changed little during the past decade. Recently, it has been demonstrated that chronic lesions originate already very early after transplantation and that subclinical rejection (SCR) in protocol biopsies is a risk factor for late graft loss. However the efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids and other therapies for the treatment of SCR have been shown to be inadequate. Thus, despite the availability of a range of available medications there remains a need for therapeutic alternatives because patients may not respond to existing therapeutic choices, they do not show an improvement of the fibrosis reaction or an effect on long term survival, or they may develop immunosuppression induced serious (sometimes fatal) side effects and toxicities.\n\nIn recent years it has become evident that bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells have potent immunomodulatory effects. MSCs are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. MSCs have potent immunosuppressive effects on T and B cells in vitro and in animal models of chronic inflammation. Encouraging results have been obtained in patients with steroid resistant acute and severe Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). The investigators hypothesize that infusion of MSCs may similarly provide a novel treatment option in the treatment of patients with allograft rejection with less side effects than existing immunosuppressive therapies.This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of MSC therapy in renal recipients.\n\nIn total 15 de novo renal recipients of 2 HLA-DR mismatched living donors, men and women, 18-65 years of age, will be recruited from the renal transplant clinics of the LUMC. Only patients with SCR abd or an increase in IF/TA in the protocol biopsy 4 weeks or 6 months after transplantation will receive MSC infusions. MSCs from patients without SCR in their biopsy will be only used for feasibility and function studies (as described earlier). Subjects will receive two doses of 1 x 10.6 MSCs per kilogram body weight, intravenously, 7 days apart. The investigators will investigate safety of MSC therapy by assessing the rate of (serious) adverse events in the study population using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Feasibility will be obtained by determining the number of expanded MSCs in relation to the amount of BM collected, number of passages required and time to reach study target doses."

                              "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetically determined X-linked disease. The manifestation of muscle weakness typically starts around the age of 4-5 in males and deteriorates fast. Typically muscle loss occurs first in the upper legs and pelvis followed by muscles of the upper arms. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin. Dystrophin is crucial to maintain the muscle fiber cell membrane.\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Corrective surgery, braces, and physical therapy may help with some of the symptoms. Assisted ventilation might be required in patients with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications prescribed include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anti-convulsants to control seizures and muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to muscle cells.\n\nFor decades, research has been conducted to find an effective therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Stem cell based therapy is considered to be one of the most promising methods for treating muscular dystrophies.\n\nStem cell based therapies for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can proceed via two strategies. The first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient.\n\nHerein, the investigators describe a method for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using autologous bone marrow derived specific populations of stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells transplanted in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)."

Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as hepatocytes. They reside in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The latter tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells. In this study, the cirrhotic patients will receive autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells which contains substantial number of mesenchymal stem cells."

They have the remarkable potential to develop in many different cell types in the body. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility, and elevated serum gonadotropins. This work aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous Mesenchymal sc (MSC) transplantation in women suffering from POF. Out of 112 high risk patients for POF, 10 cases were diagnosed as POF. The ten POF patients were scheduled for MSC transplantation at Al- Azhar University Hospitals. MSC preparation from the bone marrow of the iliac crest was laparoscopically injected in the ovaries.

Unfortunately these studies were largely uncontrolled, underpowered, and/or retrospective in nature. Additionally, a recent prospective, randomized clinical study of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected at a separate time point post surgical intervention has highlighted the ability of MSCs to increase meniscal volume and improve knee pain following injection.\n\nThis will be the first study to examine the effects of autograft BMAC intra-articular injection in a single-stage procedure and in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion. The results of this study, if the null hypothesis is rejected, will have far-reaching implications for the standard of care in meniscal treatment and on OA progression in the knee. Additionally, if the results of this study are favorable in reduction of OA progression this study will change the surgical approach to all axial, synovial joints including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle."

As it does not use allogenic tissues and is incubated without additional genetic modification or mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.\n\nIt primarily aims to improve pain and joint function, and secondary, to regenerate cartilage. The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is expected to stimulate the regeneration and growth of cartilage, and to innovatively improve pain and joint function with cartilage regeneration within six months.\n\nThe subjects of this therapy were regenerative patients with K&L grade 2~4 aged 18 or older. JOINTSTEM is expected to be used in patients who have significantly damage cartilage due to its cartilage regeneration ability, in addition to its improvement of pain and joint performance. A;sp. Patients who had already undergone knee arthroplasty can delay their additional surgery with the use of JOINTSTEM. For dose who still have their own cartilage, arthroplasty is not an immediate treatment option, and osteoporosis patients who cannot undergo arthroplasty due to their advanced age can receive JOINTSTEM."

Furthermore, the concept of fixed prenatal pool of oogonia has been challenged and postnatal neo-oogenesis is currently proved.\n\nVery small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) are found in the ovary. VSELs are stem cells that have noticed to survive chemotherapy induced gonadal insufficiency. Data from animal studies showed that stimulation of these stem cells result in regeneration of the affected ovary. Stimulation was achieved by injection of mesenchymal stem cells that is supposed to secrete trophic factors.\n\nNumerous studies in mice have proved the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in resuming the ovarian function after chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency. These studies have been followed by researches on human being. Human studies included the use of stem cells from different sites including BM, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord.\n\nAllogeneic BMT raised the moral conflict about the origin of the newly developed oocytes. Although studies proved that these newly developed oocytes to be genetically traced to the recipient; some other studies showed that the newly developed oocytes originate from the donor BM. Several small studies examined the use of autologous BMT both in animal and in human. The results of these studies were promising. Use of autologous BMT also avoids the need for chemotherapy for conditioning and other related complications associated with allogeneic BMT. Human studies mostly used the ovarian injection of the BM. Intravenous injection is simpler and less invasive than ovarian injection as the later involves the use of laparoscopy. However, intravenous injection has not tested until now."

                              "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder diagnosed in about 1% of the population, or c. 400,000 patients in Poland. Autoimmune refractory epilepsy is rare but most disabled epilepsy leading to developmental regression. The belief in a positive effect of ADRCs in drug-resistant epilepsy comes from test results showing the ability of mesenchymal cells to concentrate in damaged tissues, as well as their strong immunomodulating, especially anti-inflammatory, properties. Patients with drug resistant epilepsy show decreased numbers of neurons within the epilepsy zone, with most of these being hyperactive and malfunctioning. Additionally, an inflammatory active reaction in affected brain tissue is visible. ADRC-induced activation of endogenous neurogenesis may increase chances that the epilepsy zone will be reduced, and give a positive impact as regards the neuropsychiatric disorders commonly present in patients with epilepsy. Another common process accompanying recurring epilepsy attacks is active inflammation. Per the literature, ADRCs show strong neuroprotective, immunomodulating and antiapoptotic qualities and they may potentially reduce the frequency of epilepsy attacks. Thus, a clinical trial with ADRCs, addressed to drug-resistant epilepsy sufferers would be promising in controlling the epileptic seizures and coexisting behavioral / psychiatric symptoms. The goal is to improve the quality of life of the patients and their caregivers.\n\nIn patients who were diagnosed with autoimmune drug-resistant epilepsy and have met the set criteria and qualified to take part in the examination, after a formal written consent of their parents at the Clinic of Child Neurology IMC neurological examination, routine laboratory tests, EEG and neuropsychological assessment will be performed. ADRC will be obtained after liposuction and isolation with Cytori system.\n\nBefore intrathecal transplantation of ADRC suspension ( 5 ml), cerebrospinal fluid will be collected for evaluation of origin protein level, oligoclonal bands, the IgG index as well as GluR3, VGKC complex/LGI1, GM1, NT-3, GAD, and NMDAR antibodies. At the same time there will be an intake of 5ml of serum to evaluate levels of immunoglobulins IgA, IgM and IgG.\n\nProcedure will be repeated 3 times every 3 months in each patient. Neurological status, brain MRI, cognitive function and antiepileptic effect will be supervised during 24 months."

                              "Burn injuries are complicated wounds to manage with a relative high mortality rate in especially large area burns and elderly patients.\n\nSubstantial tissue damage and extensive fluid loss can cause impaired vital functions of the skin. When healing is delayed, the potential short term common complications include wound infection affecting the local healing process or systemic inflammatory and immunological responses which subsequently can cause life threatening sepsis and multi-organ failure.\n\nFortunately, survival rates have improved drastically over the last century due to advancements in burn care such as early surgical intervention, critical care support and wound care.\n\nFor many years the \"gold standard\" for treating wounds of burn patients has been transplantation with an autologous split skin graft. In patients with extensive burn wounds donor sites may be limited. In order to cover all the wounds, the patients often need multiple operations and/or the skin had to be expanded as much as possible.\n\nHowever, the current different expansion techniques and treatments [mesh and Meek-Wall] frequently lead to scar formation, especially in the large mesh intersites.\n\nThe rate of wound closure depends on how quickly epidermal cells migrate out of the meshed auto graft and/ or wound edges to close the wound. Accelerating re-epithelialization could potentially improve the outcome of the healing process in terms of reducing granulation tissue formation, reducing the healing time, and thereby reducing the risk of colonization and infection, as well as scar formation.\n\nSince clinical cases were first successfully treated with cultured epithelial layers, keratinocyte sheets have become an important tool in burn wound treatment. However, the clinical application can be limited by long culture time and fragility of the keratinocyte sheets. There is, therefore, a clinical demand for other options to cover large areas of burn wounds in the absence of viable donor sites.\n\nA novel concept consists of treating wounds with epithelial cell suspensions. In 1998, Fraulin et al. developed a method of spreading cell suspension on to wounds using an aerosol spray in a porcine model.\n\nThe use of non-cultured keratinocyte suspensions was first reported by Hunyadi et al., showing that a group of patients with burn wounds or chronic leg ulcers, treated with a fibrin matrix containing keratinocytes, healed completely, as opposed to the control group.\n\nIn porcine wound models, non-cultured keratinocyte suspensions have been shown to accelerate wound healing, improve quality of epithelialization, and restore melanocyte population, compared to the respective control group.\n\nMajor advantages in the use of non-cultured cell suspensions are a drastic reduction of preparation time and possibly easier handling compared to keratinocyte sheets. Particularly, scar quality may be improved by enhancing the speed of epithelialization and fading of mesh patterns in split skin grafts.\n\nOn the other hand, stem cell-based therapies have gained interest as a promising approach to enhance tissue regeneration.\n\nStem cells are characterized by their multipotency and capacity for self-renewal. Their therapeutic potential is largely due to their ability to secrete proregenerative cytokines, making them an attractive option for the treatment of chronic wounds.\n\nStem cells from numerous sources are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials for their ability to faster wound healing and tissue regeneration. These trials have not only proven autologous stem cell therapy to be safely tolerated, but also demonstrated positive clinical outcomes.\n\nAccording to the International Society of Cellular Therapy, mesenchymal stem cells are defined by their ability to adhere to a plastic surface, by their expression of the surface markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, by their lack of expression of hematopoietic markers CD14, CD34, CD45, CD11b/CD79, and CD19/HLA-DR, and by their ability to differentiate along osteoblastic, adipocytic and chondrocytic pathways.\n\nIsolated from tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood, nerve tissue, and dermis, MSCs have been administered both systemically and locally for the treatment of cutaneous wounds.18 Although mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to exhibit low levels of long-term incorporation into healing wounds, a growing body of research suggests that their therapeutic benefit is attributed to their release of trophic mediators, rather than a direct structural contribution.19 Through the release of vascular endothelial growth factor, stromal cell-derived factor-1, epidermal growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, mesenchymal stem cells promote new vessel formation, recruit endogenous progenitor cells, and direct cell differentiation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix formation during wound repair.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells also exhibit key immunomodulatory properties though the secretion of interferon-\u03bb, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, as well as through the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Mesenchymal stem cells secretion of prostaglandin E2 further regulates fibrosis and inflammation, promoting tissue healing with reduced scarring.\n\nFinally, Mesenchymal stem cells display bactericidal properties through the secretion of antimicrobial factors and by upregulating bacterial killing and phagocytosis by immune cells.\n\nAdipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells are a pluripotent, heterogeneous population of cells present within human adipose tissue.\n\nHowever, isolation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells is readily accomplished using liposuction aspirates or excised fat samples, which are obtainable with minimal donor morbidity.\n\nAdipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can be differentiated into adipogenic, chondrogenic, myogenic, and osteogenic cell lineages in response to specific stimuli. Alternatively, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may be immediately administered without in vitro expansion or differentiation in culture.\n\nThe extraordinarily high cell yield from lipoaspirate (as many as 1*107 cells from 300 ml of lipoaspirate with at least 95% purity), as compared with bone marrow aspiration, makes Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells a particularly attractive cell source for the acute wound setting."

The objective of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of ASCs inoculation in peri-tibial area, though reducing pain significantly in patients with CLI not eligible for revascularization.\n\nAutologous fat grafting is widely used for soft-tissue augmentation and replacement in reconstructive and aesthetic surgery providing a biocompatible, natural and inexpensive method. Noteworthy, recent reports have identified adipose tissue as the tissue in the body that contains the highest percentage of adult stem cells. These adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) can undergo multilineage differentiation and may be crucial for the surgery purpose of healing ulcers as they have potent regenerative effects on endothelium and immunomodulatory properties.\n\nAdipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are considered to be an attractive alternative to pluripotent cells with characteristics similar to BMMSCs. Compared with these latter cells, ASCs offer several advantages, including ease of isolation, less donor morbidity, relative abundance, and rapidity of expansion. Preliminary attempts with ASC cell therapy have been made to induce healing of ulcers developed in peripheral vascular diseases of some animal models and human disorders.\n\nThe benefits of peritibial inoculation of autologous adipose tissue are the reduction of ischemic pain, the improvement of skin and muscle perfusion, the suspension of major amputation interventions and the healing of trophic lesions if present.\n\nThe result of the intervention varies from individual to individual and depends on the engraftment of the transplanted material. In some cases the pain completely disappears. In others, the transplanted material may undergo varying degrees of reabsorption (from 50% to 70%) and therefore a new transplant may be necessary after some time (6-12 months).\n\nThe risks are linked to local complications of the procedure such as edema, ecchymosis, pain in the district of surgical aggression (the extent of these three manifestations varies from patient to patient, but are generally modest), dehiscence, bleeding of the wound, site infection surgical.\n\nThe study has a total duration of 24 months. The recruitment phase lasts 18 months. After the surgical procedure, the patient will be followed for 6 months, during which he will undergo outpatient visits at 7 and 21 days; then at 1, 3, and 6 months. At each visit, the patient will be assessed for the amount of pain and the transcutaneous oximetry value. As in the usual clinical practice and in the diagnostic-therapeutic path of the arteriopathic patient, instrumental examinations (measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index - ABI, arterial ultrasound Doppler lower limbs) are performed at the enrollment, at the twenty-first day and 6 months after the procedure .\n\nThe investigators will include 20 patients with CLI who satisfy the inclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to select patients with CLI, not suitable for revascularization and who are in reasonable health condition to allow trial participation. Study participants are recruited from our own outpatient population or emergency room. Baseline characteristics are collected during the first visit and include medical examination, ABI and TcPO2 evaluation and Doppler ultrasonography to study the arterial axis of the limb. If CLI is diagnosed, the patient is hospitalized and undergoes an angiography study. Quality of Lyfe test is administered at hospitalization and at follow up.\n\nAfter angiogram, treatment of choice will be selected during the multidisciplinary vascular conference taking the individual condition of patients into account. Patients eligible for revascularization are submitted to open/endovascular surgery. Patient with CLI unsuitable for revascularization continue hospitalization being given best medical therapy, i.e. pain-killer drugs and prostanoids. Only to these class of patients an adjunctive treatment with local fat grafting is proposed. Information sheet is given to every patient after interview with investigators and informed consent is taken before the procedure."

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune de-myelinating disease in which the myelin sheaths of nerve cells in the central nervous system are damaged.This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and psychiatric issues. To date, There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks.\n\nStem cells possess strong immunomodulatory properties that are shown to play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesion. Clinical studies have shown that stem cells can be safely harvested and do not form tumors. Most of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both. When administered intravenously they have an immune inhibitory effect that can ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). When administered intravenously, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of nervous cells. Hence, MSC have become the focus of studies as a potential cell therapy for stimulating neuro-protection in human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.\n\nWe propose a safety and efficacy trial of a intravenous and intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells into patients with MS."

                              "Basic information:\n\nLipogems: Lipogems\u00ae system is a disposable device for liposuction, processing and adipose tissue reinjection. Procedure takes place in a single surgical time. It's a disposable device that progressively reduces adipose tissue clusters size, washing completely pro-inflammatory oil and blood debrides through a minimal manipulation \"free enzyme\" in a aseptic closed system completely pre\ufb01lled by room temperature physiological solution.\n\nLipogems product is a non-expanded and microfractured fat tissue ready for autologous settings.\n\nSalveColl-E: Salvecoll\u00ae is sterile bioplastic, equine derived, type I collagen material with a fully preserved fibrous structure (non-reconstructed) that ensures the regeneration of affected tissues. Type I collagen has zero risk of transmitting viral or microbial infections.\n\nRationale for the trial: To evaluate the efficacy of the use of ACSS in crohn related perianal fistulas. The aim of the study is to improve fistula healing at 1 year from 25% to 65%.\n\nTreatment of subjects At the time of fistula diagnosis the patients will be screened for eligibility and a informed consent will be administered . All patients will be underwent a loose seton placement after antibiotics prophylaxis administration with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole to obtain a pelvis sepsis resolution at time 0.\n\nAt week 4 a surgical procedure will be performed. In general anesthesia a antibiotics prophylaxis will be administrated and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be collected by LIPOGEMS system to prepare ASCS.\n\nIn the infiltration step, adrenalin in a saline solution (2 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) is infiltrated using a 19-cm specially designed disposable blunt cannula.\n\nThe vasoconstriction together with the blunt point of the cannula avoids any accidental intravascular injection and facilitates the subsequent lipoaspiration. Three hundred to 500 ml are usually injected in the chosen area for fat harvesting (usually the lower abdomen), making the tissue really \"filled\" with the injecting solution. The aspiration step (lipoaspirate) is performed by a luer lock syringe connected to a disposable 19-cm blunt cannula (3 mm OD), with 5 oval holes (1 \u00b4 2 mm). A few strokes using a standard liposuction technique are enough to harvest 6-10 ml of fat tissue. Vacuum while aspirating can be obtained manually or by clamping the syringe plunger with a clamp instrument. Up to 1,000 ml can be harvested in less than 15 min, and 1-2 min are enough. The harvested lipoaspirate can be progressively put into the device using multiple 10-cc syringes.\n\nSubsequently, in lithotomy position, a seton will be removed and a fistula tract will be thoroughly curetted and irrigated. After a mucosal flap preparing round the internal opening, cells will be injected in the perianal adipose tissue.\n\nBetween 40 and 130 ml of lipoaspirate (ideally 100 ml) are processed at each time in the standard 225-ml device. To avoid cell damage, no air should be in the device during all procedural steps and the device should be prefilled with saline before beginning the processing. The aspirated fat should be always surrounded by a liquid environment: this is essential to obtain healthy smaller fat clusters instead of oil and adipose tissue debris. The first cluster reduction was obtained by pushing the aspirated fat from the syringe into the device and through the first size reduction filter while allowing the corresponding quantity of saline to exit towards the waste bag. The final Lipogems product is then collected into 10-ml syringes connected to the upper opening of the device. The final Lipogems product is now ready for the injection in the perianal fistula.\n\nAfter a SALVECOLL-E paste injection into the fistula tract the mucosal flap will may be closed with an absorbable interrupted sutures. A external opening will be sealed with Dermabond Mini.\n\nThe patients will receive a intravenous infusion of Infliximab (Remicade) at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight at weeks 8, 10, 14 and every 8 week for a total of nine doses.\n\nRationale for treatment The ASCS injection in the perianal adipose tissue in association with Infliximab therapy, would improve a crohn related perianal fistula healing.\n\nThis association could be reduce a recurrence and reintervention rate with an improvement of quality of life.\n\nTrial population Number of subjects to be studied Planned number of subjects to be screened: 10 Anticipated number of trial sites: 1\n\nWithdrawal criteria The subject may withdraw at will at any time. The patient may be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator for safety concerns. If the patient withdraws or is withdrawn at any time after receiving trial product, final safety information will be obtained.\n\nPatients who are deemed during surgery not suitable included in this protocol will be withdrawn from the study. In case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified in the CRF.\n\nA patient withdrawn from the study will be analyzed according to evaluability of Subjects for Analysis.\n\nMethods and assessments Visit procedures\n\nThe study comprises of the following visits:\n\nVisit 1: Diagnosis, baseline visit and first surgery procedure: Screening of patient, Baseline examination, Pre-surgery and surgery assessment, Informed consent.\nVisit 2: Treatment visit: Surgery\nVisit 3: Medical treatment: start Infliximab administration\nVisit 4, 5, 6, 7,8,9: Medical treatment follow-up\nVisit 10: end of study: last infliximab dose\n\nIn case of any premature discontinuation of the trial, the patient will, if possible, be called in for a last visit. Even if the patient is not able to attend, the End of Trial Form must be completed.\n\nThe Investigator must keep a subject screening log and a subject enrolment log. These can be combined in one document.\n\nSubjects enrolled in the trial will be provided with a documents stating that he/she is in a trial, contact address and telephone numbers.\n\nIn case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified in the CRF.\n\nAll patients will be classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification as described below. No restriction regarding to ASA status will be applied in this trial.\n\nPatient Compliance The investigator will reinforce compliance with the protocol by ensuring that only patients willing to follow the trial procedures are enrolled in the trial.\n\nDefinitions adverse events\n\nAdverse event (AE):\n\nAny untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.\n\nAn adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.\n\nNote: This includes events from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol.\n\nThe following should not be recorded as AEs:\n\nPre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent.\nPre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures. These should be recorded as medical history/concomitant illness.\n\nAn AE can also be a clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity which requires active management (i.e. discontinuation of trial product, more frequent follow-up or diagnostic investigation).\n\nThe following events will not be recorded as adverse events, as such discomforts are expected to be related to the surgical procedure:\n\nPost operative nausea/vomit\nPost operative sore throat due to intubation\nPost operative pain due to surgical intervention within 3 months from the operation.\n\nSerious adverse event (SAE):\n\nA SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:\n\nDeath\nA life-threatening* experience\nIn-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nA persistent or significant disability/incapacity\n\nImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.\n\nThe term \"life-threatening\" in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.\n\nNon-serious adverse event:\n\nA non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of a serious AE.\n\nSeverity assessment definitions:\n\nMild - No or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities.\nModerate - Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities.\nSevere - Considerable interference with the subject's daily activities, unacceptable.\n\nRelationship to trial product assessment definitions:\n\nProbable: good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship\nPossible: a causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed\nUnlikely: the event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product\n\nOutcome categories and definitions:\n\nRecovered - Fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed consent.\nRecovering - The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial.\nRecovered with sequelae - As a result of the AE the subject suffered persistent and significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyzed). Any AE recovered with sequelae should be rated as an SAE.\nNot recovered.\nFatal.\nUnknown - This term should only be used in cases where the subject i"

                              "Design Randomized, controlled trial with blinding. To maintain allocation concealment all participants, care givers, trial investigators and outcome assessors except the Blood Bank staff will be blinded to the intervention. Staff from the Blood Bank will not have direct contact with the patients (hereafter the participants) as such.\n\nProject plan For inclusion in the study participants will have their usual medical history taken according to guidelines from the Ear, Nose and Throat Surgical Department, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet.\n\nAll participants will undergo a mini lip-suction, from which MSCs will be ex vivo expanded in a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-approved clean room facility (The Blood Bank, section 2014). When the cells arrive at the Blood Bank, participants will be randomized to either ex vivo expansion of their mesenchymal stem cells or having them frozen for potential later use. Expected ex vivo expansion phase is 3-4 weeks. The purification and isolation will be based on a protocol previously approved for clinical use.\n\nAmount of MSCs required for injection Based on published animal studies the amount given for xerostomia to mice varies from 2 x 105 to 2 x 106 [19]. To convert these mice data to a realistic dose in humans we have extrapolated based on the following data: The volume density of submandibular glands very closely approximates 1 (1.06-1.07 mg/mm3) [27]. In the mice studies on radiotherapy the mean gland weight was approximately 350mg, which corresponds to an approximate volume of 350mm3. Therefore the mouse dose pr. gland volume is approximately 286.000-2.860.000cells pr. cm3 gland (when calculated from either 1 x 105 to 1 x 106). The volume of the submandibular gland in human subjects after radiotherapy is 6.6-7.9cm3 [28]. This corresponds to an approximate dose pr. patient of between 1.9 x 106 to 2.2 x 106, or 1.9 x 107 to 2.2 x 107 cells pr. submandibular gland. From the above assumptions and in order not to give to few cells we have chosen to proceed with the maximum dose corresponding to 2.8*10^6 MSC/cm^3 gland, i.e. a maximum total dose per patient of approximately 4,6 * 10^7 MSCs. However to standardize the dose given to patients, the amount given will be standardized to the size of their submandibular glands, as described below.\n\nInjection of MSCs into submandibular glands Subjects will go to the ENT-department, section 2073 for inpatient procedures. The surgical procedure is done under local anaesthesia using ultrasonic guidance and sterile technique. After receiving the MSC-suspension or placebo-suspension, the surgeon will identify the submandibular glands and inject the suspension MSCs. Calculation of injected number of MSCs pr. participant rests on the following calculation: , where volume is the volume of the submandibular gland, and a gland-volume of app. 7-8cm3 is the norm. Therefore the amount of cells given to each participant will be app. in total. Afterwards the participant will be given a band-aid and over the counter analgesics. The MSCs will be suspended in Isotonic NaCl (0,9 mg/ml) and Human Albumin (HA) 1% to a final volume of 2ml. Placebo will be 2ml of Isotonic NaCl (0,9mg/ml) and HA 1%.\n\nFollow-up MRI of the recipient place will be performed after 3-4 weeks and 3-4 months postoperatively. MRI is used for volume determination of salivary glands and control of recipient place.\n\nAfter 3-4 months, a small biopsy is randomly taken from one of the two salivary glands. The procedure takes place under local anaesthesia. Histology is determined (samples are blinded to the pathologist).\n\nWhen the final MRI, biopsy and salivary function test has been performed approx. 3-4 months after treatment specific study related tests and activities are concluded. To detect late complications or late adverse events all study participants who received MSC-treatment are invited for a check-up 1 year and 3 years after treatment.\n\nSafety, isolation and propagation of MSC The Blood Bank has its cell-tissue approval from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (according to the Danish Tissue Law), as well as a Manufacturer's/Importer's Authorisation regarding Human Medicinal Products, the necessary physical facilities, personnel and operational resources to produce MSCs in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP).\n\nThe MSC product will be tested for recognized surface markers (CD73, CD90, CD105,) using flow cytometry, and undergo general quality checks before the final release (cell viability and tests for microorganisms). With regard to the cultivation of the MSC we will use basal medium supplemented with human platelet lysate from healthy blood donors instead of the former use of animal-derived serum (fetal bovine serum, FBS). This has the following benefits: 1) No likelihood of transfection of both known and unknown animal pathogens, or risk of xeno-immunization 2) Small batch-to-batch variation and thus more consistent growth performance, since each group is prepared from approx. 50 healthy donors.\n\nAll harvest, isolation, expansion, etc. of MSC will be in accordance with GMP regulations. The Blood Bank has clean room facilities approved by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority for GMP compliant cell expansion for clinical use, and all studies will be carried out by specially trained personnel.\n\nAssessment of xerostomia and subjective treatment outcome The subjective effect of the treatment is assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue scale of xerostomia filled out by the patient [31] and a physician-rated questionnaire [32], both carried out before as well as after treatment. Each participant will also be asked about daily symptoms of dry mouth according to the UKU side-effect rating scale item 3.3 [29]. This scale includes four scores where 0 denotes no feeling of dry mouth, 1 denotes a slight feeling of dry mouth, 2 denotes a severe feeling of dry mouth, and 3 denotes troublesome feeling of dry mouth that makes speech and eating difficult.\n\nAssessment of salivary flow rate and objective treatment outcome Changes in the secretion rate of the unstimulated whole saliva in the oral cavity is probably the most important parameter for the biological development of xerostomia and accompanying pathological oral conditions. Whole saliva, e.g., the mixed secretions from the major and minor salivary glands is mixed in the oral cavity. A correct determination of this value is crucial for the assessment of treatment outcome in this project. For assessment of the saliva flow rate, whole saliva will be collected between 9 and 12 a.m. Subjects will refrained from eating, drinking, smoking and oral hygiene for 2 hr before the collection. After being seated upright in a chair, they relax for 5 min and are then instructed to make as few movements as possible, including swallowing, during the collection.\n\nBefore and after treatment unstimulated whole saliva will be collected using the spitting method [33] where participants spit their saliva into a collection container over a period of 15 minutes. The salivary flow rate (SFR) (ml / min) is determined as the increase in weight of the container divided by the collection time in minutes.\n\nAfter the collection of unstimulated saliva, the subjects are instructed to chew on 1 g of sterile paraffin wax. They will be asked to keep their mouths closed during chewing and to avoid swallowing. Every 60 sec they will be asked to spit into a new saliva collector before starting a new chewing period. This will be repeated for 5 min.\n\nTo assess treatment outcome of the submandibular glands, saliva is also collected directly from the floor of the mouth in an unstimulated and stimulated state. The unstimulated whole saliva flow rate of the submandibular glands will be assessed by the swab method with cotton rolls placed buccally in each maxillary molar region and under the tongue on the floor of the mouth. Immediately prior to the start of collection they will be asked to swallow, in case this is not possible saliva will be extracted by a pipette. Collection takes place during two subsequent periods of 3 min and, at the end of each period, the chin and lips will be wiped with a napkin. Saliva flow rates are determined by weight (1 g equals 1 ml of saliva) with rolls and napkins weighed before collection and reweighed after. The flow rates is calculated as the increment in weight during collection and expressed as millilitres per minute. Saliva from the cotton rolls will be extracted by centrifugation (1500g) and analyzed for its composition. This stimulated collection process will be performed afterwards with citrus-containing rolls to stimulate the submandibular glands maximally. From each of these collections of saliva, saliva will be aliquoted and stored at -800C.\n\nChemical analysis of saliva Whole saliva contains a large number of bacteria and epithelial cells, as well as gingival crevicular fluid. Therefore, whole saliva is normally not suited for the analysis of sensitive chemical parameters. For this purpose, the selectively collected saliva from individual glands is much better. As a result, the majority of analyzes can be performed from either the parotid and submandibular gland / sublingualis saliva. The following analyzes will be performed on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by ionic balance estimation [34], sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride [35], total protein and selected proteins [36] and amylase [37]. The purpose of the studies is to evaluate whether saliva will be normalized after treatment, and thus provide an estimate of the saliva dental and mucosal protective capacity before and after treatment.\n\nData collection and analysis Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report Form (CRF).\n\nThe study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring, audit and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines Authority or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA for the processing of personal data under the Danish Data Protection Act. Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet."

Despite the large variety of bone substitutes that have been used to fill these cystic lesions, to date there is no graft material which can be regarded as completely satisfactory, with a recurrence rate that ranges from 5-40% of treated cases. Autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear cells have been used previously to treat ABCs. Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds have been used in bone tissue engineering due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility. Human platelet lysate (PL) contains a number of mitogenic growth factors and has been demonstrated to enhance mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation and expansion rate in vitro. This study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of using PLGA scaffolds seeded with autologous bone marrow MSCs and supplemented with osteogenic media and platelet lysate in healing bone lesions of patients suffering from aneurysmal bone cysts. This study will be conducted at the Cell Therapy Center (CTC), Jordan. Four ABC cases will be included. Patients qualified for this study are those diagnosed with ABCs and failed to be treated with other forms of classical therapies; such as allografts or who are not candidate of autografts."

Patients should have heart failure with ejection fraction between 15 to 45%. Randomly patients are selected to receive a stem cell transplantation with best possible heart failure medication, or without cell transplantation. In this study, 30 patients are receiving bone marrow transplantation, and 30 patients are serving as a control population. All patients will receive CABG.The study will be carried out with randomized, double blind techniques for one year. Randomization (in blocks) will be based on a table of random numbers.Bone marrow and patients own serum will be blinded by using colored syringe, so that the doctor transfusing the sample, will not be able to know the nature of the sample. From all patients, a right atrial biopsy will be collected for assessment of autologous cardiac stem cells. Also sample of pericardial fluid will be collected for measures of growth factors.\n\nComparisons: Preoperatively, patients will be imagined by cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, cardiac PET and SPECT. Serum pro-BNB samples will be collected. Postoperatively at 3 months and 6 months pro-BNB and cardiac ultrasound will be evaluated. At one year cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, cardiac PET and SPECT will be reassessed.\n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease treatments beside the transplantation will be optimized according to the judgment of the doctors of the outpatients clinic. Primary endpoint of the study is the change of ejection fraction in MRI images."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative and disabling disease of joint joints, in which metabolic impairment between the synthesis and degradation of cartilage and subchondral bone, involves progressive destruction of joint tissue accompanied by chronic pain and synovial inflammation. Currently, available therapies are mostly palliative and designed to mask symptoms. The study proposed here has been constructed on the basis of the scientific evidence reported in the literature regarding the etiology and the treatment of OA. As recently demonstrated, the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow was effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently, treatments aimed at treating the bone-cartilage interface in arthritic knees have been studied and proposed. In the 2016 Val et al. pilot study, stem cells from the tibial bone marrow injected into the percutaneous bone-cartilage interface were described as a new therapeutic approach to osteoarthritis of the knee. This procedure is able to repair cartilage by stimulating subchondral bone angiogenesis and alleviating ischemia associated with arthritic knee pain, generating extremely positive outcomes in patients with low-grade osteoarthritis and relieving long-term pain in patients with high-grade osteoarthritis. This treatment is also able to induce differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, leading to an increase in the size of the intra-articular matrix, demonstrating an effective and minimally invasive treatment for the resolution of OA. The study described here aims to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the synergistic effect of both injections, with the aim of improving the symptomatic picture of patients with OA of the knee. Combining percutaneous injections at the bone-cartilage interface with intra-articular injections will provide proven results for the use of stem cells such as cartilage repair, increased vascularity, and pain reduction, in both compartments of the knee affected by OA. The positive effects reported in the literature regarding intra-articular injections will be combined with those reported with respect to the use of percutaneous injections at the cartilage, in order to obtain a better outcome in the treatment of the disease than in previous studies."

                              "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a type of inflammation of the skin. It results in itchy, swollen, red, and cracked skin. The symptoms typically start in childhood with changing severity over the years. The pathogenesis of AD is characterized by excessive type 2 helper T cell mediated inflammatory responses, resulting in B lymphocyte mediated increase in serum level of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Subsequent degranulation of mast cells by IgE releases various inflammatory mediators, which recruit the lymphocytes and eosinophils into the lesion.\n\nCurrent clinical management of AD includes topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants. However, these drugs have been reported to carry the risk of side-effects and severe.\n\nSeveral recent studies including ours have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could suppress allergic responses in AD. MSCs have been known to interact with cell types of both innate and adaptive immune systems, which results in the suppressive effect on proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune cells including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Indeed, a number of studies have reported that the immunomodulatory ability of MSCs can be usefully applied for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammation-related diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis. Therefore, MSCs has possibility as a new drug for AD."

                              "Background: Cranial bone defects are often left following brain surgery, usually to allow swelling of the brain to recover before subsequently re-implanting a protective covering of the brain at a later time (cranioplasty). These procedures are performed anywhere over the cranial vault, either unilaterally or bilaterally. The original piece of bone (autologous bone plate = bone flap) is placed in a sterile container and stored in a refrigerator at temperature of -40oC.\n\nWeeks or months later, when the brain is relaxed, the scalp well healed and the patient's medical condition permits, the individual is taken back to the operating room and the bone is reimplanted (A procedure known as an autologous cranioplasty). The aim of the procedure is to restore cosmesis and protection to the underlying brain and it can sometimes also improve neurological symptoms by unknown mechanisms. Unfortunately these aims are not always achieved and whilst technically straightforward the procedure is known to be associated with a number of complications. Two of the most significant of these are infection (such that the bone flap needs to be removed and replaced) and resorption (such that the protective function is compromised). Overall 10% of autologous bone patients become infected, 10% require replacement due to resorption and 12% become significantly resorbed, then in 32% of case the autologous bone has failed.\n\nIn each case of cranioplasty failure the patient requires readmission, a second operation to remove the bone flap, prolonged antibiotic therapy (in the case of infection), and then a new custom-made plate and readmission for a third surgical procedure.\n\nIn most cases synthetic materials such as polymethylmethacrylate and titanium mesh are used for reconstruction. Commonly reconstruction is carried out by the surgeon using such materials to sculpt the cranioplasty. More recently, hydro formed titanium plates have been used. This entails a process of CT scanning the defect, virtual reconstruction, 3D printing of moulds, pressing the plate and hand finishing. Whilst highly successful in treating more than 150 patients, the titanium cranioplasty remains in the patient for life and, as a non-biological material, presents as a preferential site for infection (approximately 5% of cases). In addition, medical CT images for assessment and treatment of neurological conditions are compromised for life due to metal artefacts arising from the plates. Furthermore, interference with metal scanning equipment commonly used for security purposes also remains a life time issue. The patients with an infected titanium cranioplasty require a fourth admission to remove the metal or polymer plate, extended antibiotic treatment and then a fifth surgical procedure to reinsert a new cranioplasty.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC): MSC are multipotent adult cells capable of differentiating down multiple mesenchymal lineages. They are adherent fibroblastoid-like cells with an extensive capacity for expansion. They reside within the connective tissue of most organs and have been isolated from bone marrow, placenta, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, amniotic fluid, circulating blood, various foetal tissues, skeletal muscle synovia, dental pulp, liver, spleen, lung and dermis. Most work has focussed on MSC derived from bone marrow, however, there are also some clinical reports using adipose tissue and placental derived MSC. MSC from different sources may not be functionally equivalent or exhibit the same differentiation potential. The main functions for bone marrow derived MSC with regards to the present study is the ability to differentiate down the osteogenic lineage. It is this ability to differentiate that has seen them applied to bony non-union and the treatment of critical size bone skeletal deficits, and in particular the reconstruction of cranial voids. In the current proposal Cell and Tissue Therapies W.A. at Royal Perth Hospital have extensive experience and have applied for an TGA (Therapeutics Goods Administration, the Australian Government regulatory authority) licence to manufacture and provide MSC for patient treatment.\n\nMSC are not immunogenic and escape recognition by alloreactive T cells and NK cells. They have low level expression of HLA class I and no expression of HLA class II. They do not express co-stimulatory molecules and are unable to induce T cell mediated immune response, and therefore can be used as universal donor cells. Allogeneic cells have been widely used in clinical trials in both immune modulation and tissue repair. The advantage of using allogeneic cells is that donor age can be controlled. The literature indicates that MSC harvested from donors older than 40 years are inferior. Since many of the patients being treated with a cranioplasty are greater than 40 years of age, the use of allogeneic cells in this study is preferable. Clinical human trials and animal studies support the use of allogeneic cells.\n\nCranioplasty: The Department of Medical Engineering and Physics at Royal Perth Hospital is a world leader in providing custom made implants and has been supplying custom made titanium cranioplasties for fifteen years. The basic methodology which has been used to treat over 150 patients includes the reconstruction of the void using advanced software based on the patients CT scan. Once the void has been reconstructed a female mould is created to press the titanium plate. The plate is then hand finished and checked for fitment on a premade defect model.\n\nBioceramic: Resorbable bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite and beta tri-calcium phosphate have been used in the treatment of bony deficit for many years. For example, ChronOS (Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf) bone graft substitute is a fully synthetic and resorbable bone graft substitute consisting of beta-tricalcium phosphate with a compressive strength similar to that of cancellous bone. The interconnected porosity acts as an osteconductive matrix for the ingrowth of bone cells and blood vessels. Such materials are used for filling of bone defects after trauma, reconstruction or correction in non-load bearing indications and commonly these materials prescribe a method of perfusion of the granules in the operating room with the patient's own bone marrow. Resorption of the bioceramics has been shown to occur over a period of 6-18 months (Buser 1998).\n\nPolymer Scaffold: There are a myriad of polymer materials used for surgery including in the area of cranio-maxillofacial surgery. The most common polymer is poly(lactic acid). PLA such as 70:30 poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) are made from a amorphous biodegradable copolymer which will ultimately resorb in vivo. The bioceramics and polymer materials are approved by the TGA for this indication."

                              "Musculoskeletal diseases are growing in the Norwegian population and are currently the largest group of the chronic diseases (31%). Musculoskeletal diseases are the largest cause of disability on the working part of our population (49%). The most frequent problems are rheumatism, osteoarthritis and unspecific back pain. The most common known etiology is traumatic events towards the joint. Often, the degenerative development starts with a small injury to the cartilage on weightbearing surface of the joint. This leads to changes in the surrounding cartilage, indicative of degenerative joint disease or arthrosis. When the injured area becomes larger than 2 cm2, the patients seem to experience pain. Our group has shown that 11% of patients, who underwent an arthroscopy for knee pain, had a cartilage injury on weightbearing surface with depth down to bone (grade IV) (Aroen et al.).Unfortunately, articular cartilage shows a very limited capacity of healing. Several surgical techniques have been developed to fill the cartilage defects, but so far none of them have been able to produce normal cartilage Chondrocyte implantation techniques are at date the most popular treatment, but have not demonstrated their superiority to other cartilage repair techniques. Some clinical randomised studies exist though a more thorough review of the cartilage repair methods in a study by Jakobsen and coauthors verified that no conclusion could be made considering treatment options for articular cartilage injury (Jakobsen, Engebretsen, and Slauterbeck). Although the natural history of these lesions is not finally outlined it is clear that for some patients the disruption of the cartilage surface imposes disability especially for the young athlete. The clinical studies report a significant improvement from the preoperative status although full knee function is not obtained with either of the techniques available today (Bentley et al.;Brittberg et al.;Horas et al.;Knutsen et al.). The expected Lysholm score of 80 and the standard deviation tends to be large or is not reported which illustrating the considerable variation and that full knee function is not obtained (Peterson et al.).The impact of disrupting the cartilage surface to obtain chondrocytes for culturing has not gained much attention in the clinical studies using this repair method. However it is reported that adverse effects exist as a result of this harvesting of chondrocytes for culturing (Whittaker et al.). Whittaker and coauthors observed that the harvesting of chondrocytes for cell culturing and subsequent implantation in talus resulted in a mean 15 points reduction in Lysholm score in 7 out of 10 patients. Furthermore, additional even in the best hands a mean Lysholm score of 79 are obtained for a single lesion at the femoral condyle (Peterson et al.). Even though the new scaffolds seem to reduce the rate of reoperation as a result of graft hypertrophy from 21 % to 9 %, the harvesting procedure of cartilage may still contribute to the suboptimal by this approach (Bartlett et al.;Gooding et al.). Consequently, there is a need for a better causing less morbidity when harvesting. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent an alternative cell source with the potential of generating hyaline cartilage without the same adverse effects. In addition with MSC more cells will be available for culturing with the potential of treatment of larger lesions possible. Furthermore, the repair potential of mesenchymal stem cells is not expected to decrease with age indicating that also the aging athlete may benefit from a procedure based on cartilage repair with this cell source (Dressler, Butler, and Boivin). The use of mesenchymal stem cell aspirate from the iliaca crest under a periosteum flap support the view that this might be an option to treat knee cartilage defects with success, although this study also has periosteum hypertrophy as a side effect in one of the patients (Slynarski, Deszczynski, and Karpinski). The beneficial effects of this therapy has also been reported in other studies both clinical and experimental ones (Takagi et al.;Wakitani et al.;Wakitani et al.;Wakitani et al.). Thus, the current project will investigate if the similar results can be obtained with mesenchymal stem cells as with chondrocytes both delivered in a commercial available scaffold in clinical trial with patients eligible for the current treatment options."

                              "Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative condition of the knee. Its current management is symptomatic. These patients might eventually need total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With the developments in regenerative medicine, stem cell has been suggested as means to regenerate the knee cartilage tissue which otherwise has little regenerative ability. Initially, stem cells were obtained from bone marrow cells; however, now they can also be obtained from adipose tissue through liposuction. With developments of less invasive liposuction techniques, adipose tissue has been identified as means for autologous mesenchymal stem cells (aMAT). There are two ways of obtaining aMAT form adipose tissue: enzymatic, which has controversies related to Good Manufacturing Practice and low yield, and non-enzymatic method which was recently further developed to a closed-system and directly ready-to-use aMAT producing Lipogems\u00ae. Lipogems\u00ae is FDA-approved for several applications including orthopedic use. A couple of case reports and cohort studies showed its potential use in knee chondropathy. Until now, no clinical trials compared its effect to the knee OA standard of care which is the intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Here, the investigators will study the comparative efficacy of corticosteroid versus Lipogems\u00ae in patients with knee OA.\n\nThis randomized clinical trial will include 48 patients with symptomatic knee OA \u2265 45 years old with no contraindication of corticosteroid and/or Lipogems\u00ae use. These patients will be divided equally into two groups: group S who will receive intra-articular corticosteroid knee injection and group L whose aMAT will be harvested using Lipogems\u00ae and be injected intra-articularly. The knee pain, clinical parameters, and patient-related outcome measures (knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score and Lipogems\u00ae Questionnaire-knee) will be assessed at baseline, 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month. Also, knee MRI will be done at baseline and 6-months to visualize any changes (MRI Osteoarthritis knee score). These outcomes will be evaluated over the 6-month period and the difference between baseline and follow-up will be compared between the two groups.\n\nThis study aims to show the comparative efficacy of Lipogems\u00ae as compared to corticosteroid in knee OA patients and to demonstrate its cartilage regeneration potential, which will ultimately deter surgery."

This gene encodes for the adenosine deaminase enzyme, which is essential for the proper growth and function of infection-fighting white blood cells called T and B lymphocytes. Patients who lack this enzyme are vulnerable to frequent and severe infections.\n\nADA-SCID patients are normally rescued by a bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a matched healthy donor. However, matched donors are difficult to find and donor BMT is associated with high risk. This trial aims to treat ADA-SCID using a safety and efficiency improved self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying a functional ADA gene to correct the genetic defect. By collecting an individual's stem cells and modifying them with a lentivirus, the gene-corrected cells can be returned to the patient to help produce normal healthy immune cells.The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the improved self-inactivating lentiviral vector TYF-ADA, the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of immune reconstitution in patients overcoming frequent infections present at the time of treatment. We will assess the lentiviral gene integration sites and the long-term effect of this gene transfer procedure."

Local autogenous bone is practically unavailable, the distant bone graft has significant morbidity and use of alloplastic materials is incompatible with the growing facial skeleton. With the advent of bioengineered tissue, however, osteogenesis induced by the use of mesenchymal stem cells associated with biomaterials has become a potential solution to the shortage bone-related morbidity and donor bone in the region in pediatric patients.\n\nThe association of mesenchymal stem cells to biomaterials has provided new bone formation and a significant reduction of morbidity, for rehabilitation of the alveolar bone in patients with cleft lip palate.\n\nTo perform the rehabilitation of alveolar bone cleft, other donor regions of bone (iliac crest, ribs, skull) suffer morbidity for obtaining bone to be used in alveolar bone grafting. In order to eliminate the morbidity at the bone donor region for these patients and reduce costs of patient permanence in the operating room the aim of this study is to perform the bone tissue engineering to reconstruct the alveolar bone defect in cleft lip and palate patients using mesenchymal stem cells from deciduous dental pulp associated with a collagen and hydroxyapatite biomaterial (Geistlich Bio-Oss\u00ae) through prospective qualitative and quantitative analysis of bone neoformation."

                              "Vitiligo, the most common depigmenting disorder is an 'idiopathic', acquired pigmentary disorder caused by the loss of functional melanocytes from the epidermis. The course of the disease is unpredictable but is often progressive with phases of stabilized depigmentation. It usually begins during childhood or young adulthood. Approximately one third to one half of the patients develops the disease before the age of 20 years. The presence of vitiligo on exposed areas of body leads to social embarrassment, psychological turmoil, and cosmetic disfigurement in those affected.\n\nIts prevalence is 1%, ranging from 0.1 to > 8.8% in different countries of the globe. Both sexes are equally affected although the greater number of reports among females is probably due to the greater social consequences to women and girls affected by this condition.\n\nTreatment options A number of therapeutic options for vitiligo are available but there is still a need for a treatment that is promptly effective. There is no curative treatment for this condition. Management of vitiligo is a real challenge for a dermatologist.\n\nMedical therapies:\n\nCorticosteroids (Topical, intralesional and systemic), Oral mini pulse, PUVA (topical and systemic), NBUVB, calcipotriol and tacrolimus are used most widely. Some of the less commonly used medical modalities include phenylalanine, khellin, topical minoxidil, levamisole and melagenina. Recently oral minocycline was shown to be effective in treating vitiligo.\n\nMost of these therapies aim to restore melanocyte function by their anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory action and by preventing melanocyte auto destruction so that normal skin appearance and function is restored.\n\nSurgical therapies:\n\nAll patients with vitiligo should be initially treated with medical methods. Surgical methods are important solutions for stable vitiligo refractory to medical treatment. High repigmentation rates are obtained with all procedures so far described in most anatomic locations, but they are of little help for acral areas and bony prominences. Unilateral vitiligo is the clinical form with the best response to grafting and transplant methods, and a good proportion of patients with stable bilateral disease also respond adequately. Nevertheless, appropriate patient selection is important to achieve maximal results.However none of the surgical modalities developed so far is uniformly effective in all patients and body sites and there is need for constant research and innovations for better surgical therapeutic options for vitiligo.\n\nAims of various surgical procedures:\n\nA) Camouflage Tattooing: Introduction of artificial pigments into the lesions for permanent camouflage.\n\nB) Excision: Removal of the depigmented areas, e.g. excision with primary closure and covering with thin Thiersch's graft.\n\nC) Melanocyte transplantation: commonly used methods of autologous transplant of melanocytes are\n\nTissue grafts:\n\nThin and ultra-thin split thickness grafts (STSG)\nSuction blister epidermal grafts(SBEG)\nMini punch grafts (MPG)\n\nHair follicular grafts (HFG)\n\nCellular grafts:\n\nNoncultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES)\nCultured \"pure\" melanocytes (CM)\nCultured epithelial grafts (CE)\nAutologous noncultured extracted hair follicle outer root sheath cell suspension also called follicular cell suspension (FCS) D) Therapeutically wounding the lesion to stimulate the melanocytes from the periphery and the black hair follicles to proliferate, migrate and re-pigment the lesion, e.g. therapeutic dermabrasion, laser ablation, cryosurgery (liquid nitrogen spraying), needling and local application of phenol or trichloroacetic acid.\n\nEvery method has its own advantages and disadvantages. As there are no specific data available from the prospective studies in this field, it is not easy to recommend which surgical approach to vitiligo offers the best result.\n\n'Vitiligo global issues consensus conference, 2011' convened by Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF), concluded that assessment of 'overall' stability is inaccurate and unreliable, whereas individual lesion stability is more reliable, especially when used in the context of surgical intervention.\n\nMethods and Size of Lesions:\n\nDepending on the size of the treated area, the method may vary. Simple methods such as mini punch grafting and suction epidermal grafting are useful for small or medium sized lesions. On the contrary, for extensive depigmented defects, cellular transplants may be required.\n\nAge:\n\nBecause of the invasive nature of surgical procedures, they are not recommended in children; nevertheless, highly motivated adolescents can be treated under sedation or general anesthesia. Also, it is not surprising to see patients beyond the age of 50 years who may be interested in surgical repigmentation.\n\nPsychological Aspects:\n\nSome patients with high emotional trauma because of depigmentation may seek advice for invasive procedures. However, a psychological evaluation may be needed to ascertain the real need for surgical treatment.\n\nPhotographic Record:\n\nIllustrations are recommended to help in determining the percentage of improvement, quality of repigmentation and possible side effects.\n\nPatient's Expectations:\n\nRepigmentation is not always comparable with normally pigmented skin and the final results vary considerably from patient to patient. However, most individuals are pleased with the achieved results; minor imperfections are far less important than the noticeable repigmentation of vitiliginous skin, mainly in ethnic skin patients with a dark complexion; sometimes surgical repigmentation may look even better than what is observed in many patients after medical therapy.\n\nMethod and Donor Site:\n\nAppropriate training with a specific method is an important prerequisite for surgical therapy. Donor site should be as hidden as possible and the gluteal region may be suitable for this purpose in most patients.\n\nSuccess rates of different surgical options:\n\nAmong all procedures, suction blister epidermal grafts and thin and ultra-thin split-thickness grafts seem to be the most effective procedures, with overall success rates of 80.3% (CI 76.4-84.2%) and 77.9% (CI 72.2-83.6%) respectively. But, a recent randomized study directly comparing NCES and SBEG showed NCES is significantly better than SBEG. Among cellular grafts, all techniques seem to be equally effective with success rates of 61.1% (CI 56.1-66.1%), 63.6% (CI 57.2-70%), and 63.6% (CI 55.8-70.6%) for noncultured epidermal cell suspension, cultured melanocytes and cultured epidermis respectively. The mean repigmentation with noncultured extracted outer root sheath cell suspension is about 65.7%).\n\nNONCULTURED EPIDERMAL CELL SUSPENSION The technique of noncultured epidermal suspension was pioneered by Gauthier et al. The suspension was prepared by incubating the donor skin obtained from the scalp in trypsin 0.25% for 18 hrs. The suspension was injected into blisters raised by cryotherapy. Eight out of the 12 patients treated had > 70% repigmentation at the vitiligo site. It was proposed that the presence of keratinocytes in the suspension supplies essential growth factors for melanocyte growth. They stated that this technique could emerge as simple and effective alternative to the costly cultured melanocyte transplantation technique.\n\nNON-CULTURED DERMAL CELL SUSPENSION\n\nDermal mesenchymal cells were originally isolated from the dermis of juvenile and adult mice by Toma et al., afterwards, same group identified such a cell population in human skin. Georg Bartsch firstly identified and characterized dermal mesenchymal cells (DMCs). DMCs had multi-lineage differentiation potential into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The surface antigenic profile of DMCs was positive for CD90 but differs in regard to negativity for CD34.\n\nZhou et al investigated the factors determining the efficiency of autologous melanocyte transplantation of vitiligo patients by focusing on perilesional skin homing CD8+ T lymphocytes, and studied the potential effects of dermal mesenchymal cells (DMCs) on CD8+ T cell activities in vitro. The patients with high number of perilesional CD8+ T cells were associated with poor repigmentation rate and a significant lesser number of CD8+ T cells was infiltrating in patients with excellent or good re-pigmentation responses. Also, skin homing CD8+ T cells proliferation was significantly inhibited when co-culture with DMCs at 1:1 ratio as the percentage of proliferative CD8+ T cells dropped from 94.72% to 39.50% (p,0.05) after DMCs co-culture. In the co-culture system, DMCs significantly inhibited skin homing CD8+ T proliferation and induced those cells apoptosis. These data confirm that DMCs induces significant immunosuppressive abilities against skin homing CD8+ T lymphocytes and may help improve the efficacy of melanocytes transplantation. Non-cultured Dermal Cell Suspension (NDCS) is a novel method to increase the efficacy of non-cultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES)."

The major problem for most patients is aplastic anemia, the blood counts for red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are low. In addition, some patients have physical defects usually involving the skeleton and kidneys. Fanconi anemia is typically diagnosed in childhood, and there is a high fatality rate. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for Fanconi anemia. However, there are many risks associated with HSCT including rejection of the transplanted cells and graft-versus-host disease.\n\nThe primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector, the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of immune reconstitution in patients overcoming immune abnormalities present at the time of treatment, assessment of gene correction efficiency, and finally the long-term correction of Fanconi anemia associated disease symptoms."

                              "Umbilical cord blood is a source of blood-forming cells that can be used for transplantation. The major problem with this type of transplant is the small number of blood-forming cells available in each cord unit, which may delay the \"take\" of the graft in the recipient. A strategy to overcome this problem is to give 2 cord blood units, increasing the number of cord blood cells in one of them in the laboratory before they are transplanted. This is done in order to increase their number. The expansion of 1, but not both, of the cord blood units will allow the research team to decide more effectively whether the laboratory expansion is responsible for the speed and content of the \"take.\" At this time, no proof exists that this expansion technique will improve the performance of the cord blood specimens.\n\nIn order to collect a larger expansion of the numbers of cord blood cells, recent research suggests that growing the cord blood cells on a layer of bone marrow stromal cells increases the number of expanded cells which can be collected. In the body, these stromal cells form a matrix or \"spider web\" in the bone marrow. Blood-forming bone marrow cells (looking like dewdrops) grow on this stromal cell matrix (spider web) and are nurtured by the stromal cells. In this research study, researchers will either collect marrow stromal cells from a family member through a bone marrow aspiration, or they will use \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells that have been collected from a healthy donor. These \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells were grown and frozen by Mesoblast Systems. These stromal cells from either your family member or \"off-the-shelf\" will hopefully improve the performance of the cord blood cells after they are given to you.\n\nPlacement of central venous catheter for collection of \"back-up\" peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC):\n\nBefore you have back-up PBPC collected or you receive chemotherapy, you will require placement of a hollow plastic tube (catheter) into a large vein inside your body. This catheter will be used to draw blood and to give medications and fluids. The catheter is inserted through the skin in the upper chest and extends to a point above the right side of your heart. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.\n\nCollection of back-up stem cells:\n\nBecause collecting additional cells from the donor of the cord blood is not possible if the transplant with cord blood fails, a back-up PBPC or bone marrow sample to ensure recovery of your marrow function will be collected from you and frozen before the high dose chemotherapy begins. This specimen will only be used if doctors think it is necessary.\n\nPeripheral blood progenitor cell collection (Leukapheresis):\n\nBefore collection of the PBPC, you will be treated with a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which will cause the important stem cells in the marrow to move the peripheral blood where they will be collected. This medication is given as a shot under the skin once a day for 3-7 days, at which time your PBPC will be collected from your central catheter during a 3-4 hour outpatient procedure. This procedure is standard, and is called leukapheresis. You will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.\n\nBone Marrow Collection:\n\nIf the leukapheresis cannot be performed successfully, you will receive general anesthesia in the operating room and will have multiple needle sticks of the hip bones in order to collect bone marrow. Less than 5 percent of your bone marrow will be taken. This procedure, if done, will also require you to sign a separate consent form.\n\nSelection of alternate back-up donor:\n\nIf your own back-up bone marrow or back-up PBPC cannot be collected, a family member will be asked to serve as a back-up donor or an identified third cord blood unit may be used should both the cord blood units fail to function. A back-up donor or product will be required for you to participate in this research\n\nSelection of a stromal cell donor for cord cultures:\n\nIn this study, researchers will identify a donor for the stromal cells. This will either be a family member or from an unrelated healthy donor whose marrow stromal cells were collected, grown, and frozen by Mesoblast Systems (off-the-shelf). If your family member is used, they will collect about 7 tablespoons of bone marrow from them.This family member's tissue type (HLA antigens) does not exactly match yours. That bone marrow will be taken to the laboratory where over 3-4 weeks, marrow stromal cells will be grown. These marrow stromal cells produce vitamin-like growth factors that may help your cord blood cells expand to greater numbers. If a family member is not appropriately HLA matched, does not meet eligibility, is not a candidate due to health reasons, or if the participant's disease is getting worse so that there is not enough time to grow the family member's marrow cells into marrow stromal cells, then \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells that have been collected from a healthy donor will be used for the procedure. These \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells were grown and frozen by Mesoblast Systems. These cells have been safely given to patients with peripheral vascular disease, but their use in this study is considered investigational.\n\nYour bone marrow transplant doctors will assign you to one of 3 chemotherapy treatments, which are discussed below.\n\nHigh-dose chemotherapy treatment (Myeloablative):\n\nIf you are between 1 and 55 years of age and can receive high-dose chemotherapy, or you are between 55 and 65 years old and your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine, clofarabine, busulfan, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and total body irradiation.\n\nYou will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over 60 minutes as an outpatient usually during the week before admission. If the test dose cannot be given as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -9 for IV fluids and the busulfan test dose. This low-level \"test\" dose of busulfan is to check how the level of busulfan in your blood levels changes over time. This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the target blood level that matches your body size.\n\nAbout 11 samples of blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of busulfan. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These blood samples will be drawn at various timepoints starting before the Busulfan infusion and continuing over approximately the next 11 hours. The blood samples will be repeated again with the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment. Each sample will be about 1 teaspoon of blood. A temporary heparin lock will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.\n\nIf you received the test dose as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8 and will receive fluids by vein. On Days -7 through -4, you will receive by vein fludarabine over 1 hour, clofarabine by vein over 1 hour, and busulfan by vein over 3 hours. You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. On Day -3, you will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation. You will \"rest\" (not receive chemotherapy drugs) on Days -2 and -1. Day 0 is the day of transplantation, so the negative day numbers are used to label the treatment days before transplant.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nLower-dose chemotherapy treatment (Non-myeloablative):\n\nIf you are older than 55 and 80 years of age or less, or are of any age with a pre-existing medical condition that prevents you from receiving high dose chemotherapy, you will receive fludarabine- cyclophosphamide-ATG-total body irradiation. You will receive cyclophosphamide as a single dose on Day -6. Fludarabine will be given once a day for 4 days in a row (Days -6 through -3). You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. You will also receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation on Day -1. Day 0 is the day of transplantation. Rituximab may be given on Day -9 if appropriate for your disease.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nReduced Intensity chemotherapy treatment:\n\nIf you are between the ages of 1 and 80 years old (and the study doctors think this would keep you from receiving the full myeloablative therapy), if you cannot receive low-dose total body irradiation, and if your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine-melphalan-ATG. Starting on Day -5 you will receive fludarabine given once a day for 4 days in a row (Days -5 through -2). You will receive Melphalan as a single dose on Day -2. You will receive ATG on Days -3 and -2. Day 0 is the day of transplantation.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nExpansion of cord blood:\n\nOn Day -14, one of your two cord blood units will be thawed in the MD Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory and expanded over a layer of marrow stromal cells from your family member or from \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells. The expansion will continue for about 2 weeks and when complete, the cells will be given to you on Day 0 as described below. A small amount of cord blood cells (less than 3%) will be used for laboratory procedures that measure the quality of the product.\n\nThe CliniMACS System is a medical device that is used to separate types of blood cells from blood that is removed from the body during leukapheresis. These separated cells are processed for use in treatments such as stem cell transplants.\n\nTransplantation of cord blood:\n\nTwo (2) days after completion of high or lower-dose therapy (Day 0), both units of cord blood (the expanded and the unexpanded cord) will be infused into you (one at a time) through your catheter. The unexpanded cord will be thawed and infused first, followed by the infusion of the cells that were expanded in the lab. Each unit will take about 30 minutes to infuse. You will then be hospitalized until your marrow function is restored enough. This usually takes between 3-6 weeks. During this time, you will receive a variety of medications, transfusions, and other standard procedures aimed at decreasing the risks of this procedure, such as graft vs. host disease (GVHD).\n\nGraft versus host disease (GVHD) preventive therapy:\n\nGVHD results from a reaction of the transplanted cord blood cells against certain tissues in your body. In an attempt to prevent or decrease the severity of GVHD, you will receive 2 drugs. Mycophenolate will be given through your catheter 2 times per day (morning and evening) on Days -3 through Day 100. Tacrolimus will be given as a 24-hour continuous infusion over 3-6 weeks. Around Day 30 or 40 (after engraftment), the tacrolimus will be changed to pills given once a day for 180 days (6 months). If GVHD is present, tacrolimus may then be continued longer. The number of tacrolimus pills may vary according to the blood levels of the drug, but usually are between 1-5 pills. Your dose of tacrolimus can be gradually lowered around Day 180 if no GVHD is present. This medicine is used for 6-9 months (longer if chronic GVHD occurs).\n\nYou will remain on study as long as your disease does not return. If your disease returns, you will be taken off study and you may be offered participation in another study or other standard treatments.\n\nFollow-up after transplant:\n\nAfter you leave the hospital, you will be seen regularly in the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation at MD Anderson. The frequency of the visits may vary, but may be as often as daily. Routine blood (1-2 tablespoons) and urine tests will be performed. The frequency of blood tests may also vary, but may be performed daily. You will have bone marrow samples collected before transplant and then as needed during the first 100 days after transplant, every 3 months during the first year after transplant, and then once a year while you are on study. After that, bone marrow samples will be collected once a year, indefinitely. These samples are being collected to look for tumor (as a staging test) and to looFk for chimerism (the percent of tumor cells detectable that can predict graft failure and/or relapse). To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.\n\nParticipants with lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease will need a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed before transplant, then as needed during the first 100 days after transplant, and then every 3 months for the first year after transplant. After that, these scans will be done yearly. You will be on study for 1 year but then will be followed yearly as is standard of care.\n\nThis is an investigational study. All treatment drugs given to you are FDA approved and commercially available. The CliniMACS device is not FDA approved. At this time, it is being used in research only. Up to 125 patients may take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

                              "As Diabetes is becoming a health problem of global concern rapidly, DPN, one of the common chronic complications in Diabetes is also getting more and more attention. The result of a survey of 5 regions in Southeast Asia showed that 39-72% of patients with DPN had severe or very severe impact on their quality of life. For the treatment of DPN, conventional drug therapy can almost only target a single pathogenesis and cannot treat it fundamentally. Therefore, new safe and effective treatment options for DPN are particularly important.\n\nBoth here and abroad, large number of experimental studies have shown that Bone Marrow or Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells have a significant therapeutic effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In 2012, the Department of Endocrinology of Wuhan Central Hospital took the lead in conducting a clinical study of Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells in the treatment of DPN in China. The results of the study showed that the nerve conduction velocity of the lower extremities in most patients was improved within 3 months after treatment compared with before treatment. No serious adverse events occurred during the period. Based on this research of our own. The clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN.\n\nThe investigators will do a Single center, randomization, open trial, controlled clinical trials design to assess treatment with the MSCs compared with the control group. 42 patients with DPN will be recruited in China. 21 patients receive i. m. HUC-MSCs both lower extremities (5 \u00d7 10^6 cells/mL, 1 mL per injection, each injection point is 2 cm apart ,1.0-1.5 cm deep, total amount of injection is estimated based on the surface area of the patient's lower limbs). 21 patients in the control group received i.v.

Impacts of a single intra-articular (IA) injection of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) containing mesenchymal stem cells on pain, physical function, stiffness, and cartilage thickness assessed and compared before and after intervention. Patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis (OA) knee included in the study. Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiological scores were used to define OA grade; however, high-frequency musculoskeletal ultrasonogram (MSUS) was used to measure cartilage thickness. There is no standard protocol to follow while assessing cartilage thickness; however, recent work of Podlipska and co-workers would be a worth consideration for using adipose tissue for cartilage regeneration. As medial tibio-femoral joint is the most commonly involved in KOA, here, we consider medial femoral cartilage thickness. The assessment used a commercially available ultrasound device (Samsung Accuvix, 2010, origin- South Korea) with a 15 megahertz linear transducer ML6-15. The patient was positioned supine with the knee in full flexion. A proximal-distal probe sweeping over the anterior-central knee area, medial femoral articular cartilage imaged in an axial plane. Degenerated cartilage signified either loss of surface sharpness or increased inner echogenicity; local or total thinning of articular cartilage. The definitions for articular cartilage degeneration are as follows: Grade 0 - a monotonous anechoic band with sharp hyperechoic anterior and posterior interfaces, Grade 1 - loss of the average sharpness of cartilage interfaces and or increased echogenicity of the cartilage, Grade 2a - grade 1 plus thinning of articular cartilage less than 50%, Grade 2b - more than 50% but less than 100% thinning of articular cartilage, Grade 3 -100% local loss of the cartilage tissue.\n\nA total of thirty KOA was randomly divided into two groups - case and control. Both groups received conventional care for KOA (acetaminophen 1 gram thrice daily for 14 days, quadriceps strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, mind-body, proprioception, mechanical diagnosis, and therapy (MDT) exercises, and activities of daily living (ADL) modifications4, 18-20. Fifteen received six milliliters (ml) single-dose of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) and 3 ml activated PRP). PRP was activated with 0.1 ml calcium gluconate per 0.9 ml of PRP (1:9 ratio). However, no orthobiological product was given in another fifteen participants."

                              "Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. BM-MSC has also been used to treat human liver diseases such as liver failure and liver cirrhosis. In a phase 1 study, autologous BM-MSC transplantation has potential to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can improve the longer term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well BM-MSC is tolerated and its safety in LC patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times UC-MSC treatment at 4-week intervals.\n\nArm B: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times saline infusions at 4-week intervals.\n\nUC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are infused intravenously. After cell therapy, patients are followed up for 75 months. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin(PA), the rountin blood test are detected at week 12, 24, 48 timepoints. Clinical symptoms as well as complication were also observed simultaneously."

Although nonsurgical treatment relieves pain and improves function in the shoulder, surgical repair for a torn rotator cuff is indicated if symptoms persisted or deteriorated after 3 months nonsurgical treatments, Recently, arthroscopic repair has become the mainstream of surgical repair for rotator cuff tear. However, the healing of a repaired tendon is not always predictable. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells, some studies have shown that autologous bone marrow concentration can improve the healing of tendon grafts in a bone tunnel. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of bone marrow concentration on healing of rotator cuff."

                              "Avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head is a progressive disease that predominantly affects younger patients. Although the exact pathophysiology of AVN has not yet to be elucidated, the disease is characterized by a vascular insult to the blood supply of the femoral head, which can lead to collapse of the femoral head and subsequent degenerative changes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells, several studies have applied the autologous bone marrow concentration in halting the progression of AVN of femoral head. However, a higher level of evidence for its use on patients suffering from femoral head avascular necrosis has not been reported. This clinical trial will evaluate and compare the eligible patients who undertake core decompression surgery plus intraoperative bone marrow concentration with those who received core decompression surgery only. All patients will be followed for one year and clinical and imaging outcomes will be compared and analyzed."

                              "STUDY BACKGROUND\n\nPerianal fistulas are diseases that, by their nature, do not tend to heal spontaneously and are very rarely cured with medical treatment. Their healing is usually pursued through surgery, which often needs to be repeated due to the natural tendency of the fistulas to recur. A surgical treatment that is currently able to provide a high chance of healing is fistulotomy which, however, can injure the anal sphincter and may result in degrading scars and possible fecal incontinence. One possible strategy could be the lipofilling, i.e., autologous adipose tissue transplant containing, among the many, pericytes and progenitor cells, including adult mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\nThis is a no profit interventional prospective multicenter study without drugs where 100 patients (10 each participant centre) with a diagnosis of trans-sphincteric anal fistula that is not suitable to be laid open will be enrolled.\n\nAfter the enrolment, medical history and clinical data will be collected and pre-operatory exams will be performed.\n\nMETHODS\n\n- Harvesting of the adipose tissue\n\nThe lower/lateral abdomen or, eventually, the inner/outer thigh will be chosen as donor site for adipose tissue harvesting under general or spinal anaesthesia. Before the harvesting, the donor site will be injected with 100 cc of Klein Solution (500 cc saline, 1 cc epinephrine 1/1000 IU, and 40 cc lidocaine 2%) using a disposable 17 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 60-cc luer-lock syringe. The fat will be then harvested (50-100 cc) using a 13 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 20-ml VacLok\u00ae syringe.\n\n- Processing of the adipose tissue with the Lipogems\u00ae device\n\nThe harvested fat will be immediately processed in the Lipogems\u00ae processing kit (Lipogems International Spa, Milan, Italy). Lipogems\u00ae is a disposable device that mechanically reduces the size of the adipose tissue clusters while eliminating oily substances and blood residues with pro-inflammatory properties. The entire process is carried out in one surgical step in complete immersion in physiological solution minimizing any traumatic action on the cells and microarchitecture. The processed micro-fragmented fat will be collected in a 60-cc syringe and positioned to decant the excess of saline solution. At the end, the product will be transferred in several 5-cc syringes to be re-injected in the patient.\n\n- Surgical procedure and micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems\u00ae) injection\n\nThe micro-fragmented autologous adipose tissue will be injected with wheals of no more than 1cc in the internal orifice, mucosal, submucosal and muscular layer, then in the fistula tract and external orifice.\n\n- Follow-up visits and outcome measures\n\nAll patients will be assessed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure."

                              "The administration of the tranexamic acid (TRAXA), an antifibrinolytic, blocks primary fibrinolysis, and thus the haemorrhage, in the early postoperative period. Significant surgical operations, as well as trauma, initiate a similar dynamic homeostatic mechanism between the creation of a clot (primary and secondary haemostasis) and its dissolution (fibrinolysis). Antifibrinolytics are initially used in patients with an accelerated fibrinolysis of different pathogeneses. However, they have been proven effective in reducing haemorrhage in patients who have undergone significant surgical operations with normal fibrinolysis, with the use of an appropriate surgical technique.\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that peak fibrinolytic activity is present for 6 hours after the incision and it persists for 18 hours in total knee and hip arthroplasty. The administration of the tranexamic acid in optional orthopaedic surgery of total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty reduces the postoperative haemorrhage, as well as the number and volume of the postoperative autologous blood.\n\nA randomized, placebo-controlled trial CRAS-2 has validated that the early post-traumatic administration of the tranexamic acid, within 8 hours after the injury, in adult patients with traumas or in patients with the risk of significant haemorrhage, reduces the fatality rate.\n\nThe tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of lysine, an amino acid which blocks lysine binding sites of the plasminogen molecule which are essential for its biding to fibrin. This mechanism inhibits the plasminogen activation via a plasminogen activator which also binds to fibrin. Thus, it prevents the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, which is essential for fibrin dissolution, the integral element of a stable clot. The second important antifibrinolytic effect is blocking the lysine binding sites on the free plasmin molecule which has already been formed through the conversion from the plasminogen. This inhibits its binding to fibrin, and the TRAXA-plasmin complex is rapidly inactivated with the \u03b1-2-antiplasmin and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin. Biological half-life is approximately 2-3 hours.\n\nA trauma in the organism triggers the immunologic response. The initial immunologic reaction occurs at the location of the injury, and it is called an inflammation. The inflammatory response is characterized by a complex interaction of macrophages (a type of leukocytes which develop from monocytes and are a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, the main task of which are phagocytosis, i.e. the clearance of foreign materiel from the organism, performing the immunologic function - the defence against foreign materiel - antigens, and the regulation of the inflammation via interleukins which they secrete - IL1, IL-2,TNF) and dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells), the consequence of which is the release of cytokines (interleukins - glycoproteins which regulate interactions among cells) and chemokine (small proteins from the cytokine group - able to induce chemotaxis, cell migration), and the activation of the neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (cells not containing any information, located in the adipose tissue, cartilage and muscle tissue).\n\nIf the initial inflammatory response at the location of the injury is strong enough, it will develop into a systemic inflammatory response, called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which implies an inflammatory response of the entire body without a proven source of infection. The criteria for the diagnosis of the SIRS are: heart rate higher than 90 bpm; body temperature lower than 36\u00b0C or higher than 38\u00b0C; tachypnoea, respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths per minute or the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood lower than 4.3 kPa (32 mm Hg); the number of white blood cells, leukocytes, lower than 4.000 cells in 1 mm\u00b3 or higher than 12.000 cells in 1 mm\u00b3; or the presence of more than 10% of immature neutrophils. A destructive immunologic inflammatory cascade can prevent or delay healing.\n\nAt the same time the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) is initiated, which includes the immunologic response with the aim of re-establishing the immunologic homeostasis. It is characterized by: a reduced cytokine response of monocytes to the stimulation; a reduced number of antigen-presenting receptors (human leukocyte antigens or HLA) on monocytes; an increased level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine; lymphocyte apoptosis (T-cells); lymphocyte dysfunction, i.e. reduced proliferation; reduced Th1 proinflammatory cytokine production (a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by the regulatory T lymphocytes). It clinically manifests as skin allergy, hypothermia and leukopenia. Additional criteria include elevated levels of C-reactive proteins, lactates and hyperglycaemia. If the immunosuppressive response persists, it may increase the possibility of an infection occurring, and the inability to defend against the infection, which may result in the development of sepsis, multiple organ failure and death.\n\nDue to the wide clinical and laboratory criteria which both the SIRS and CARS terms include, they are not the best terms for describing the immunologic response to a trauma, and a new term has been introduced - the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI), characterised by: a change on the immunologic cells (neutrophilia, monocytosis, increased number of mesenchymal stromal cells, reduced expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells, increased lymphocyte apoptosis, a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by Treg lymphocytes - CD4+CD25+CD127-); a change in production levels of various cytokines (anti-inflammatory cytokines): IL-10, IL-4; anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine: IL-6; pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3); the activation of the complement system (C5a and C3a via factor VII - tissue factor system, activated by cell damage).\n\nPost-traumatic immunosuppression can be made worse by transfusion, haemorrhage, stress, significant surgical operation and immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nThe research has shown that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).\n\nThe normal function of Treg lymphocytes is the suppression of the T-cell response against its own antigens.\n\nStopping haemorrhage prevents the occurrence of anaemia, as well as the need for transfusion of blood products, which lead to developing the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI).\n\nMonitoring the immunologic status of patients with the understanding of the PTI mechanism can enable timely and individual modulation of the immunologic status with pre-planned procedures (preventing haemorrhage, anaemia, avoiding transfusion) and/or immunotherapy (drugs and nutrients), and thereby prevent the occurrence of complications, such as infections. Infections may result in sepsis and multiple-organ failure, and eventually be lethal for the patient.\n\nThe research has proved that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).\n\nThe normal function of Treg lymphocytes is the suppression of the T-cell response against its own antigens.\n\nThere are two main types of regulatory lymphocytes: natural Treg, which are mostly developed in the thymus, and inducible Treg, which arise in the periphery after being exposed to cytokines, antigen-presenting cells or immunosuppressive drugs. It may be difficult to differentiate these two lymphocyte Treg populations in vivo. Nevertheless, it is known that different stages of the infection require different regulations. Acute infection, tissue damage, inflammation caused by the innate immunologic response is limited, i.e. locally controlled via natural Treg lymphocytes. This mechanism triggers the activation of inducible Treg lymphocytes.\n\nFor the first time, in 1995, it was described that the suppression of CD4+ T-lymphocytes is caused by a low T-cell population with the CD4+ CD25+ expression. Natural Treg lymphocytes, apart from belonging to CD4+ T-cell population, have a CD25+ receptor, an \u03b1-receptor chain for IL-2, and a receptor for the cytotoxic T-lymphocytic antigen 4 (CTLA 4), the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNF), but it differs from the activated T-cells by the expression of the transcription factor FoxP3 (transcription factor encoded with the FoxP3 gene). The expression of CD 127lo, an \u03b1-chain receptor for the interleukin 7 enables us to differentiate Treg lymphocytes from the activated T-lymphocytes via flow cytometry. The number of CD25+CD127lo cells correlates to the number of CD25+FoxP3+ cells in the peripheral blood.\n\nDifferent studies show that the application of the 3-colour flow cytometry shows small variation in the percentage of Treg lymphocytes in the peripheral blood from 6.35% to 8.34%.\n\nThere is a number of different mechanisms which achieve regulation by using the Treg lymphocytes: the long-term interaction with dendritic cells (DC), thereby modulating the function of antigen-presenting cells (APC), the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 and the CTLA4 expression on Treg cells which induces the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in APC which degrade the amino acid tryptophan, the lack of which inhibits the activation of T-cells and induces T-cell apoptosis. Treg lymphocytes also induce the apoptosis of monocytes and affect the lower expression of HLA-DR on monocytes whereby they directly affect the innate immunological response.\n\nElevated, suppressive activity of Treg cells in traumas prevents the protective Th1 response for up to 7 days in comparison with the healthy population."

Some animal-based studies showed that stem cell transplantation could ameliorate liver fibrosis and improve liver functions followed by several clinical trials on human, in patients with advanced liver diseases, these studies demonstrated that stem cell transplantation could significantly reverse hepatic failure with only limited side effects.

                              "Problem of Interest: Lung transplantation represents a potential therapy for patients with end-stage lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema and cystic fibrosis. The major limitation to long term survival in lung transplant recipients is the development of graft failure over time, termed bronchiolitis obliterans. The conventional therapies used to prevent rejection are not effective in preventing bronchiolitis obliterans. Therefore, new therapies are needed to address this problem. A growing body of research has focused on a unique population of bone marrow cells termed Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to improve a range of medical conditions including heart failure, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. MSCs can prevent animal models of bronchiolitis obliterans. Because of this information, it is plausible that MSCs could help patients as a potential treatment in lung transplantation. MSCs can be obtained from 2 sources: commercially available MSCs which are generated from other normal volunteers and from the patient themselves. When MSCs are obtained from the patient for whom they are used, they are termed \"autologous MSCs\". A major potential drawback to the use of commercially available MSCs is that these cells contain proteins from other individuals which could provoke rejection when used in lung transplant recipients. Therefore, the use of autologous MSCs currently appears the most attractive option. What is not understood at the present time is the extent to which autologous MSCs obtained from chronically ill patients with end-stage lung disease still maintain properties which would be beneficial. This proposal will test the immunologic properties of MSCs generated from such individuals to answer the question of whether generation of whether it would be feasible to use such cells in the future to prevent entities such as bronchiolitis obliterans.\n\nOverview on how this will be studied: The Investigator will approach patients who are being considered for a lung transplant because of end stage lung disease. Enrolled patients will undergo a bone marrow aspiration where a small amount of fluid is removed from their pelvic bone. Cells obtained in this procedure will be expanded in the Emory/Georgia Tech Cell Lab. MSCs will be expanded in this lab using cell culture conditions which are standardly used for MSCs. The Investigator will test the efficiency of expansion of these MSCs to determine if they can be obtained from all patients, or if there some patients demonstrate inefficient MSC expansion based on age or disease or other factors. The Investigator will then test in-vitro the ability of MSCs from different patients to prevent activation of the immune system when faced with proteins from other individuals. The Investigator believes this model system approximates the type of interaction that would occur if these MSCs were given to patients who received a lung transplant.\n\nBenefit of research to knowledge and human health: It is not presently known whether patients with severe medical illness are able to have MSCs expanded. If it is found that MSCs can be readily obtained from such individuals and additionally find that such MSCs have properties which would be predicted to be beneficial in lung transplant, this study would provide the rationale to use MSCs as a therapeutic agent in patients undergoing lung transplantation."

The first follow-up will occur at 4-weeks post-treatment at which time rescue medications may be prescribed or adjusted but no other analgesic interventions should occur. The primary outcome measure will be pain relief at 3 months post-treatment, while a positive categorical outcome will be a 2-point or greater decrease in average LBP coupled with either a score > 5/7 on the PGIC (indicating noticeable improvement) or a 10-point decrease in ODI (indicating a clinically meaningful benefit). At 3 months, a repeat MRI will be obtained in selected patients at military treatment facilities (i.e. every 5th patient). Those who fail to experience a positive categorical outcome will be withdrawn from the study to receive alternate care, including an option for intradiscal BMC in those who received corticosteroid. For those who continue to experience a positive outcome, there will be 6- and 12-month follow up visits. At all follow-up visits, histories and physical exams will be performed and questionnaires assessing sleep, function, and anxiety and depression will be administered."

However, to the authors knowledge no RCT in the United States has formally evaluated safety of ADRC in the setting of ON. Therefore, the primary endeavor of this Phase I pilot study will be to evaluate safety of ADRC for pre-collapse ON of the femoral head.\n\nThe Celution 800/GP System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, USA) for preparation of ADRC from lipoaspirate is currently being evaluated in FDA approved clinical trials including an orthopedic indication (osteoarthritis). In addition, the device has a CE Mark registration in Europe and Class I approval in Japan. As such, it serves as a known platform that produces a clinical grade product for human use. Other devices on the market process lipoaspirate by either mechanical, washing, or centrifugation methods; however, the remaining components of original adipose tissue are significant and impair the regenerative process. Derivation of relatively pure ADRC has been achieved by few devices and the Cytori Celution 800/GP System is the only one to our knowledge with a sufficient safety and efficacy track record enabling multiple investigational device exemption (IDE) approvals. The reagent used (Celase\u00ae) is of a clinical and pharmacologic grade for use in humans. The production of Celase is free of mammalian products."

Subjects that have a current diagnosis of chronic lumbar disc disease and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Chronic lumbar disc disease is defined as back and/or radicular pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history, physical examination, and radiographic measures such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plain film, myelography, discography, or other acceptable means.\n\nSubjects randomized to active treatment will undergo bone marrow harvest for processing into BRTX-100 for intradiscal injection. Subjects randomized to control will also undergo a bone marrow and blood harvest but only receive saline intradiscal injection procedures. Subjects will return to the study site for a visit at Week 2, Week 12, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104/Early Termination.\n\nThe trial will have a Safety Run-In component that will insert a 3+3 design for the initial subjects dosed with BRTX-100 at 40 \u00d7 106 cells. Specifically, the randomization scheme will be briefly shifted from the overall trial 2:1 randomization to an initial 3:1 allotment of intradiscal BRTX-100 versus saline control. As such, four subjects will initially be randomized and administered their agents. There will be a 14 day safety follow-up period that must elapse between dosing of each of the first four (4) subjects. Dosing of each subsequent subject in the Safety Run-In component cannot occur until the independent Medical Monitor (MM) reviews the previously-dosed subject's blinded data, including but not limited to physical examination findings, laboratory values and reported adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), at the completion of the 14-day visit and documents the findings. If no potential dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) is noted by the MM, the MM will approve the dosing of the next subject. If a potential DLT is noted by the MM, the MM will request that an ad hoc Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of unblinded data occur per DSMB Charter before the next subject is dosed."

                              "The acetabular labrum is a wedge shaped fibrocartilage structure attached to the acetabular rim. It is continuous with the transverse acetabular ligament at the inferior aspect of the acetabulum. The medial aspect of the labrum abuts the acetabulum to form the chondrolabral junction.\n\nAnatomic labral refixation aims to preserve healthy tissue and restore native joint anatomy and biomechanics. Labral tears that are caused by Femoro-Acetubular Impingement (FAI) require concomitant correction of bony cam lesions, pincer lesions, or both to prevent reinjury of the labrum. However, repair has not yet been proven to mitigate the osteoarthritic accelerating effects of labral tears. Many patients presenting with hip pain in the third and fourth decade of life already have osteoarthritic changes seen at the time of arthroscopy. Restoring the biomechanics of the joint via labral repair does not reverse this damage and investigating methods to repair early osteoarthritis is important to the future of hip arthroscopy.\n\nBone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has been used effectively in many joints for the management of chondral defect repair. As an alternative to the aforementioned chondral treatment modalities, BMAC treatment does not require multiple procedures or additional waiting time for treatment completion.\n\nWithin the technical constraints of the hip joint, bone marrow aspirate concentrate is feasible and potentially efficacious option for the treatment of chondral defects. Late stage hip osteoarthritis is a known factor implicated in poor outcomes in both the surgical and non-surgical treatment options available for chondral defect management. Preventing late stage hip osteoarthritis is paramount to decrease these poor outcomes and improve the patient's quality of life. Early and effective intervention with modalities that afford patients little to no drawbacks, like BMAC treatment, are necessary to achieve these goals.\n\nThis is a prospective study which will enroll 300 adult subjects with evidence of an acetabular labrum tear and pincer or cam deformity. Labral tears will be diagnosed by clinical exam and positive magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) findings. Pincer deformity is diagnosed with standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis, and cam deformity is diagnosed with antero-posterior and lateral radiographs.\n\nAdministration of diagnostic modalities is independent of study protocol as they are routine standard of care. Upon diagnosis, eligible potential subjects will be approached for study enrollment. After consent, enrolled subjects will undergo arthroscopic labral repair using a capsular chondrolabral preservation technique with or without BMAC based on intra-operative findings. The decision to use BMAC is made intra-operatively; therefore the patients are consented for the BMAC prior to surgery. If the chondrolabral junction shows advanced arthritis or the absolute absence of wear the BMAC is unnecessary and not used. This surgery in the absence of BMAC is considered routine practice and standard of care.

                              "Treatment of anal fistula pursues permanent healing and preservation of anal continence, not always easy goals in complex anal fistulas.\n\nIn patients with Crohn's disease, simple surgery (ligation of the path and suturing of the internal orifice) associated with injections of stem cells derived from autologous or allogeneic adipose tissue has been shown to cure up to 70%. of the cases. Similar results have been obtained in small series of patients with fistulas of cryptoglandular origin and also in rectourethral and rectovaginal fistulas of other etiologies. Unfortunately, this treatment is time consuming and extremely expensive.\n\nFresh adipose tissue is an alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with regenerative capabilities, immunomodulatory angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. The injection of fresh adipose tissue, obtained by liposuction from the same patient, is currently a therapeutic alternative used in regenerative medicine, plastic and orthopedic surgery indications, as well in other fields. Beneficial effects of fresh adipose tissue on anus fistulas and fecal incontinence have also been reported.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the injection of autologous, microfragmented and minimally manipulated adipose tissue, associated with a surgical technique that obtains by itself up to 70% cure in order to add the benefits of surgery with those in regenerative medicine hoping that the beneficial effects of MSC will aid in the healing and repair process.\n\nA prospective study is proposed in 12 patients with non-Crohn's-related complex anals fistulas. Whenever possible, the endorectal advancement flap technique will be applied; in blind fistulas and special cases, in which the flap is not indicated, alternative techniques will be used. In all cases, autologous, micro-fragmented and minimally manipulated adipose tissue, obtained with a standardized procedure, previously validated and authorized, will be injected. This procedure uses the \"Lipogems \u00ae\" device (Lipogems International SpA, Milan, Italy), with which a well-characterized adipose tissue is obtained with the maximum safety guarantees."

                              "Diabetic foot (DF) is a concomitant illness of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is one of the main causes of non-traumatic amputation worldwide due to severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease with chronic critical limb ischemia being the most abundant problem. Ulceration occurs as failure of oxygenation, nutrient supply and progressive occlusion of larger blood vessels often exacerbates pre-existing microvascular abnormalities.\n\nPurified bone marrow mononuclear cells or expanded bone marrow cells enriched in Cluster of Differentiation 90+ (CD90+) mesenchymal stem cells (named tissue repair cells, [TRCs]) are used in the treatment of diabetic ulcers in comparison to bone marrow derived stem cells to induce revascularization of the affected limb and to enhance local perfusion. Cells are administered intramuscular or intraarterial. A control group of patients treated according national guidelines without stem cells serves as comparator.\n\nDiabetic foot patients with chronic limb ischemia and without the option for surgical or interventional revascularization were recruited and randomized to the transplant groups or the control group within this clinical trial. To measure the therapeutic effects of the various treatment arms patients were evaluated for (ankle brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TcPO2), and reactive hyperemia (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD]). Patients also underwent imaging with angiographic methods."

                              "The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS. Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies, directed against human differentiation antigens (CD34, CD45, CD14, CD90, CD73, CD29, CD49b, CD166), conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (CFI) or phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from BD Biosciences (USA).\n\nIsolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) obtained from human bone marrow. In the present study, isolated EMFs from bone marrow (BM) from patients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic nonunion (failure of a bone union at fracture sites) will be used. These cells were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these patients. The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at the University Hospital of Caracas, Hospital Universitario de Los Andes, Hospital P\u00e9rez de Le\u00f3n II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient through informed consent. In this protocol, the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture in the iliac crest. This procedure was performed in the operating room, under anesthesia and by a medical specialist. The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) with heparin (Sanofi Aventis). The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium (Irvine Scientific, USA) enriched with 20% autologous serum. These cells were kept in culture in a controlled environment at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells were eliminated, and a basal culture medium (alpha-MEM-Chang / 20% autologous serum) was added. Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs. Culture medium exchanges were made until reaching a confluence close to 70-80%. The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures, following the process described above. Microbiological examinations were performed after obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation. After using MSC, a batch of these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C.\n\nPhenotypic characterization of MSC. Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried out by flow cytometry. For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask by using trypsin-like enzymes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD29, CD166 and CD49b) and hematopoietic (CD34, CD45 and CD14). Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100% of the cells used for transplantation in each patient were MSC.\n\nMSC differentiation studies. The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined by culturing these cells in osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media, following a methodology similar to that previously described. Briefly, the MSCs were detached and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well, proceeding to add the corresponding differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone (100nM, Biotech), ascorbic acid (10mM, Sigma), inorganic phosphate (1.8mM, Merck) and beta-glycerol phosphate (2mM, Sigma). For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes (Cell Application, USA) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial medium NH Adipodiff Human (Miltenyi, USA) was used. In all cases, the cells were kept in culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days. To demonstrate the changes associated with the differentiation process, the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (Merck, USA) and specific stains were performed for each case. Briefly, alizarin red to detect calcium deposition (evidence of osteogenesis), Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans (evidence of chondrogenesis), and oil red (Oil Red) to see lipids (evidence of adipogenesis). In all cases, microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out. For endothelial differentiation (CEn), EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, USA) enriched with 10% autologous serum, 10\u00b5g / ml of human epidermal growth factor (hu-EGF, R&D) and hydrocortisone (1\u00b5g / ml, Sigma).\n\nMSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. All MSC processing procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to induce bone regeneration. The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been phenotypically and functionally characterized. The MSC will be thawed, grown and expanded as previously described. A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs, and another part will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium (CEM-Endo). Once the required number of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached, a suspension of these cells (75,000 cells from each of them) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium, without phenol red, supplemented with 20% autologous serum. Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar, at room temperature, to the Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (IVIC).\n\nUnder sterile conditions, the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth area; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC / MSC-Endo / PRP implant. At the same time, the culture medium supernatant is removed from each tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo \"button (pellet)\" is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension, 5% CaCl2 and thrombin will be added. Immediately, and before the clot forms, 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP suspension will be placed in the root canal, covered with a collagen membrane. Subsequently, the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp chamber, ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the tooth.\n\nPost-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF\n\nClinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of EMC.\nRadiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of mesenchymal stromal cells.\nA tomographic evaluation will be performed when the periapical repair will be evident in a periapical radiograph."

                              "Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by the lack of ability to produce blood-clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Individuals with hemophilia A suffer repeated bleeding episodes, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes even death due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently. The current treatment is intravenous infusion of clotting factor concentrates, either prophylactically or in response to bleeding. The procedure is life time long and expensive while still cannot achieve a cure.Gene therapy is a novel technology that has been successfully demonstrated in a number of clinical studies for diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases. In this study, an advanced lentiviral vector system NHP/TYF will be used to deliver a functional FVIII gene to overcome human clotting FVIII gene defect in patients with hemophilia A. This study is a Phase I trial evaluating the safety and efficacy for infusion of gene modified autologous stem cells in patients with hemophilia A."
