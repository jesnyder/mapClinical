A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.\n\nScores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures.

In order to have a reproducible measurement in subsequent examinations, the operator will look for and note down precise anatomical landmarks or, in case of large areas, will mark the points with an indelible marker, saving a digital image for future reference. Patients will again under go ultrasonography of the treated area at 24 weeks post treatment. During this repeat ultra sonography same operator will again measure the subcutaneous thickness of the treated in millimeters. The difference in two measurements will be noted down as residual volume. Means of residual volumes in two groups will be compared."

Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms.

The ASIA assessment is the gold standard for assessing SCI. The exam is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body. Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0-5 according to the adjacent table, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0-2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. Each side of the body is graded independently. The ISNCSCI exam is used for determining the neurological level of injury. ASIA Impairment Scale for classifying spinal cord injury includes five grades: A, B, C, D and E."
