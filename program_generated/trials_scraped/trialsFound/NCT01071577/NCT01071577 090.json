                              "Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be grown from bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, and are being used to treat a number of disorders including: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this protocol is to collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to produce clinical grade BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients and to develop new methods for producing and assessing the quality of BMSCs. In some cases, the donors will be the recipients of the ex vivo expanded cells (autologous transplantation). In other cases, no matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the marrow donor and the BMSC recipient, so the donors will be required to meet the same healthy history and infectious disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood donors. The BMSCs will be produced in the GMP Clinical Cell Processing Laboratory, located in the Cell Processing Section (CPS), Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center. After the BMSCs are produced by the Cell Processing Laboratory, they will be infused directly into Clinical Center patients on protocol, or cryopreserved and stored, and used as they are needed to treat Clinical Center patients. Up to 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This protocol will provide a mechanism for banking fresh and frozen BMSC products that can be used for patient care and research. This is not a treatment protocol. Subjects receiving these BMSC products will be enrolled in specific BMSC treatment protocols."
