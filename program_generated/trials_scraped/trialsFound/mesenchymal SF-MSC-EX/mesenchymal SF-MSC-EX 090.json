                              "Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes will be developed and patented as an advanced technology platform as an autologous treatment protocol to repair damaged cartilage tissue. The fact that this treatment is obtained from an autologous source will significantly contribute to the literature in the field of personalized therapy (personalized medicine) and will pave the way for discoveries. Experiences from clinical trials may guide the use of MSC exosomes in other tissue and cell damaged pathologies and immune pathologies or chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nThis study was supported by a grant (1004, 20AG031) from The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)."
