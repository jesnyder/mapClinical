In Tegner-Lysholm knee scoring, examinations for the knee joint (Limp, support, pain, instability, locking, swelling, stair-climbing, and squatting) will be evaluated, and a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0 points will be given. According to the evaluation, <65 points are interpreted as bad, 65-83 points as fair, 84-90 points as good, >90 points as excellent. Scores will be recorded by being examined before treatment and at the 6th, and 12th months after treatment. Knee functions of the control group will be evaluated simultaneously, and the effects of treatments on knee function will be determined.",

IPAQ short form will be evaluated and recorded before treatment and at the 6th, and 12th months after treatment. The control group's physical activity will be evaluated simultaneously, and the effects of treatments on physical activity will be determined.",

The VAS will be evaluated and recorded before treatment and at the 6th, and 12th months after treatment. The physical activity of the control group will be evaluated simultaneously, and the effects of treatments on pain will be determined.",

The same radiological imaging will be performed at the 6th and 12th months after the treatment. At the same time, the same radiological imaging will be performed on the control group, and the effects of treatments on radiological imaging will be evaluated.",
