The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).",

The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function\n\nThe transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.",

The sub-scales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There is no single overall score for MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores (scale scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher scale score indicates improved quality of life)."

Certain features, such as the appearance of a new cartilage defect or increase in the size of existing cartilage defects or osteophytes, is generally considered an indication of osteoarthritic progression. Similarly, the diminishing in severity or size of existing abnormalities would generally be considered to be a healing(improving) response."
