Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function.- Hormone therapy is used to treat female hormone deficiency and results in a significant improvement, but long-term use increases cardiovascular disease or cancer risk. Other treatments do not give apparent results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and effective treatments to achieve the requirements of improving health in general and sexual health in particularly in women. AD-MSCs have been widely used as autologous and allogeneic stem cell sources to treat numerous disease recently, and they have been proven to be safe. The phase I trial showed that administration of autologous AD-MSCs at the dose of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kg patient bodyweight was safe for patients with sex hormone deficiency. The therapy introduced potential improvement in sexual and general quality of life indicating by the increased FSFI. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

PC is an extremely infiltrative neoplasm that usually presents with vascular and perineural invasion in surgically resected tumors. Metastases to lymph nodes, liver and distant sites are all very common. Its incidence has markedly increased over the past several decades and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Despite the high mortality rate associated with pancreatic cancer, its etiology is poorly understood. PC patients experience physiological symptoms such as anemia, ascites, severe fatigue, pain, cachexia, weakness, insomnia, confusion, and memory loss. The aggressive nature of PC leads to rapid deterioration of patients' quality of life and diminished ability to participate in treatment."

It's the main factor of UFF that could lead to the Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS). Using the potential features of MSCs in the treatment of fibrosis may offer new insights into reconstruction the damaged tissues. The project intends to transplant autologous MSCs to ten peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra-filtration failure. It's going to study infusion effects in clinical, cellular and molecular levels.\n\nSo in this trial, we will evaluate the effects of this intervention after intravenous injection of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in 10 peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra filtration failure (UFF). Fifteen UFF patients are also considered as the control group. Then they will be followed 20, 45 and 90 days, and also 4 and 6 months after first injection."

                              "RATIONALE: It has been shown that about 30% of patients do not respond to immunosuppressive therapy or experience recurrence, and graft rejection and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) decrease event-free survival to 30% to 50% in the alternative donor (matched unrelated, partially matched family member) transplantation. Although an overall and disease free survival of 85% to 100%, can be obtained in allogeneic blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation using an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor, only about 25% of patients have such a donor.\n\nPURPOSE: In an attempt to avoid GVHD, reduce earlier infection rate and decrease regimen-related toxicity while maintaining better engraftment, this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient's own adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) or AD-MSC transdifferentiated HSC (AD-HSC) transplant after an immunosuppressive regimen in treating patients who have severe aplastic anemia.\n\nThe patient will be in the study for one year for observation and active monitoring. After treatment and active monitoring are over, the patient's medical condition will be followed indefinitely. The principle measures of safety and efficacy will be :\n\nPatient survival probability at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.\nEngraftment at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year\nIncidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and Incidence of earlier infection rate as well as other complications within 6 months and 1 years."

The symptoms including: Pain, facial weakness, scapular fixator, humeral, truncal, pelvic girdle and lower-extremity weakness, High frequency hearing loss, Retinal telangiectasia . The existing treatments are not effective so, cell therapy is a new hope to improve patients' quality of life. Therefore, We design this clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of stem cell transplantation."

He was emergently transferred to Miami, FL for stabilization and treatment, where he was diagnosed with a C5 -C6 Grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6: 7mm, with flexion teardrop fracture of the anterior aspect of C6, as well as jumped facet on the right and perched facet on the left at C5-C6 with spinal canal stenosis with cord compression, as well as with aspiration and near drowning. He underwent ACDF (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion) of C5-C6 and reduction of jumped facets and was immediately started on a hypothermia protocol to reduce spinal cord edema. His hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia. He discharged to Texas via air ambulance for physical rehabilitation on August 23, 2017 with a diagnosis of ASIA B (American Spinal Injury Association) C-5 SCI (spinal cord injury)."

                              "Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.\n\nTherefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new opportunities for development of the same.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue.14\n\nAs limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been undertaken to explore the tolerability & effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC in second treatment arm in IPF patients.\n\nAdipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective"
