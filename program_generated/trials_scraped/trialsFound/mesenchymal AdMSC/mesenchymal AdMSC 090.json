                              "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both. Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. They are used by multicellular organism to organize, coordinate, and regulate multiple functions of cells and tissues in the body. They are considered as chemical messenger molecules that send signals from one cell to another within or between various body parts. Hormones are responsible for regulating many physiological processes and behavioral activities such as growth and development of the body, metabolism, homeostasis of intracellular and extracellular fluid, and reproduction. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function. The phase I clinical study named \" Single-group, open-label clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for early sex hormone deficiency in middle-aged people\" showed that AD-MSC therapy for patients with hormone deficiency is safe, can improve the sexual quality of life in both men and women. A significant statistical increase of testosterone levels was observed in male patients at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month. In female patients, the FSFI was 20.70 at baseline and increased to 27.1 at 12 months after AD-MSC infusion (p<0.05). There were no significant changes in AMH, FSH, or E2 infusion compared to baseline in the 16 enrolled patients. Within those under 45 years old, FSH and E2 tended to increase at 3 months after ADSC infusion and decreased at the follow-up after 6 and 12 months. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

However, despite the current major progress in diagnosis and microsurgical repair, the prognosis in TBPI remains unfavorable due to limited donor nerve and compromised regenerative capability of the nervous system arising from prolonged denervation. Therefore, there is a major need to devise new treatment strategies; and one possible approach is to develop cellular therapies to bioengineer new nerve tissue and/or modulate the endogenous regenerative mechanisms within the injured nerve.\n\nOur previous studies have shown that the peripheral nerve tissue engineering approach using human amniotic membrane seeded with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs to augment axonal regeneration in nerve transfer of TBPI patient revealed promising functional recovery of the shoulder range of motion (ROM). The investigators plan a non-randomized clinical trial in a single center to investigate the use of a hybrid (composite) between human amniotic membrane (HAM) and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC) as wrapping in the nerve transfer procedure of upper TBPI patients, with a focus on the augmentation of axonal regeneration"

Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nAs current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine in the treatment of psoriasis.\n\nThis study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nTherefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to participate in this study will be interviewed."

Prevalence is estimated to be 8-16% worldwide. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease and usually means that the patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT), which may involve a kidney transplant or a form of dialysis. One of the options in RRT is continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD is characterized by a continuous removal of extracellular fluid by peritoneal membrane. It should be noted that like any other peritoneal dialysis therapy, CAPD has Short or long-term complications and UFF is the most common functional disorder in which the peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damaged.\n\nThis project intends to evaluate, the role of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients who have ultrafiltration failure up to 6 months.\n\nIn this study, 10 male and female subjects who are on peritoneal dialysis for at least two years and have ultrafiltration failure with age range of 18 to 70 years will be enrolled. Patients will be selected from peritoneal dialysis patients attending the peritoneal dialysis ward of Dr. Shariati hospital. The main inclusion criteria is to be on peritoneal dialysis for at least last two years and having Ultrafiltration failure. After obtaining the consent form, a sample of fat tissue will be obtained by a general surgeon under sterilized condition from patients and then in the specialized lab, the mesenchymal stem cells will be separated and cultured to reach appropriate numbers (106/kg). The cells will be injected through peripheral vein in hospital setting. Patients will be followed-up (clinically and laboratory) at baseline and at week 3, week 6, month 3, month 4 and month 6. The clinical assessment and peritoneal function tests will be performed in each visit. Outcome measures: The main outcome measures that periodically will be assessed include: D/P cr, D/P urea, D0/D glucose, PET, KT/V urea, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)"

                              "Severe aplastic anemia is characterized by severe deficiencies in peripheral-blood platelets, white cells, and red cells. These defects in mature cells occur because aplastic bone marrow contains severely reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells. To date, Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants are routinely used to treat patients with many different diseases, including various cancers and blood disorders, such as aplastic anemia. The main sources of HSCs are bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood. However, challenges include obtaining enough functional HSCs to ensure optimal engraftment, and avoiding immune rejection and other complications associated with allogeneic transplantations. Novel abundant sources of clinical-grade HSCs are therefore being sought.\n\nOur novel studies have demonstrated that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted rapidly (in 4 days) into AD-HSCs on a large scale (2X108-9 cluster of differentiation 34\uff08CD34\uff09positive cells) by transfection of small RNAs to the the early region 1A (E1A)-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines. In vitro, AD-HSCs expanded efficiently and resembled cord-blood HSCs in phenotype, genotype, and colony-forming ability. In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. we show that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted into AD-HSCs by transfection of small RNAs to the E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines.

In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. In the safety aspect, we saw no evidence of leukemia, teratoma and other cancers in the blood, testes and subcutaneous tissues of transplanted mice. More importantly, our preliminary data have shown that AD-HSCs can reconstitute hematopoietic function in five patients with severe aplastic anemia. Based on these premilitary studies,, we have determined to conduct a further clinical investigation in multiple medical centers. In this study we plan to enroll up to 90 patients, to make a comprehensive assessment for this new treatment regimen and to show it is equal or superior to the current immunosuppressive regimen. Patients will be in the study for one years for treatment and active monitoring. All patients will be followed until death."

Even with these treatments, many patients eventually still require dialysis. Other treatment strategy doesn't exceed beyond symptomatic treatment and delaying the progression. Also risk of recurrence after kidney transplantation is 20-50%.\n\nCell therapy is one of the treatment strategies and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one modality that notice in glomerulus disease.\n\nWe will evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of allogeneic AD-MSC (adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 5 refractory INS patients.They will be followed 1, 2, 4 weeks and then monthly until a year following injection day."

The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.\n\nAbdominal fat will be harvested through a small incision and processed by the Mayo Clinic IMPACT laboratory using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and previously established standard operating procedures (SOPs) to produce clinical grade, autologous, culture-expanded AD-MSCs for subsequent intradiscal injection. All injections will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis. A final visit for evaluation and imaging will be conducted at the end of the study."

These evaluations include the following:\n\nCollection of vital signs, demographic information, and concomitant medications.\nEvaluation of the eligibility requirements for participation in the expanded access program.\nWeight and height measurements.\nLab sample collection. (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood Count & Coagulation Tests).\nPhysical examination.\n\nParkinson's disease assessments. (MDS-UPDRS, PDQ-39, PFS-16, PHQ-9, and VAS). Once these assessments have been performed and the results of laboratory tests have been obtained, the principal investigator must evaluate whether the screened patient is eligible to participate in the expanded access program. If a participant meets the eligibility requirements for participation in the expanded access program, infusion number 1 (the baseline visit) must be scheduled.\n\nInfusions Every patient who qualifies for participation in the expanded access program will be invited to receive autologous HB-adMSCs infusions. The administration of investigational products will take place at the Hope Biosciences Stem Cell Research Foundation, where the delegated personnel will closely monitor patients' vital signs.\n\nFollowing the Sponsor Standard Operating Procedures, Hope Biosciences autologous adipose- derived mesenchymal stem cells should be mixed and administered to each eligible patient. HB-adMSCs should only be administered intravenously and a vital sign monitoring of two hours post-drug exposure. Monitoring intervals of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.\n\nAdditional to the administration of the investigational product, the delegated personnel should complete the following assessments.\n\nCollection of vital signs, as well as updates on medical history and concomitant medications if needed.\nWeight measurement.\nCollection of laboratory samples at INF 1 and INF 5. (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood Count& Coagulation Tests).\nPhysical examination.\nParkinson's disease assessments. (MDS-UPDRS, PDQ-39, PFS-16, PHQ-9, and VAS).\nVideo documentation at INF 1 and INF 5 to evaluate the patient's gait, facial expression, and other symptoms associated with the disease.\n\nDetermination of the incidence of AEs and SAEs. Immediately following the completion of each infusion, the patient should be assessed to ensure that the post-infusion discharge criteria have been met.\n\nFollow Up A follow-up will be conducted during this visit. Delegated personnel will communicate with the patient to determine whether any adverse events or serious adverse events have occurred since the last visit. Also, during this visit, updates on medical history and concomitant medications must be recorded in the patient's chart if needed.\nEnd of Expanded Access Program\n\nPatients will be assessed by delegated personnel on the last visit of the expanded access program, which will take place at week 26. The following assessments will be performed:\n\nCollection of vital signs, as well as updates on medical history and concomitant medications if needed.\nWeight measurement.\nCollection of laboratory samples.

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

                              "A screening visit will be conducted to assess the eligibility for this investigation. If the participant qualifies the expanded access program eligibility requirements, he will be treated with the investigational product in the following manner:\n\nThe patient will receive 8 infusions of 200 million cells every four weeks during a 28-week period.\n\nThis is an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of autologous HB-adMSCs for treating a single patient with Polyneuropathy due to POEMS Syndrome. The expanded access program will include a screening period of up to 28 days, a 28-week treatment period, a safety follow-up, and a 52-week end-of-study visit.\n\nAn informed consent form will be given to the participant, who will sign before any procedures.\n\nThe informed consent form will include information about this expanded access and all the aspects considered during this process. The following are components of the informed consent process that research personnel should adhere to:\n\nThe principal investigator and team will make sure the participant is alert and able to read and understand the language in the consent form.\nThe principal investigator and team will ensure the participant takes ample time to read the consent form carefully.\nThe principal investigator and team will ensure the consent form is carefully explained to the participant or legal guardian. Any questions or concerns should be addressed before signing the document.\nOther aspects to consider, such as voluntary participation in the expanded access program, will be followed according to FDA guidance, IRB Guidelines for Researchers and Sponsor standard operating procedure\n\nThe participant is required to complete the subsequent visits after they have given their informed consent.\n\nVisit 1 - Screening during this period, the principal investigator will determine whether the screened participant is eligible and whether the next visit can be scheduled. Once the principal investigator has evaluated the eligibility (up to 28 days), the patient will be scheduled for the first infusion.\nVisit 2 - Infusion 1 (Baseline): this visit will be a starting point for comparing participants' data. During this visit, the patient will receive the 1st investigational product via intravenous infusion, with rigorous monitoring of vital signs for a total of 2 hours.\nVisit 3 to 9 - During these visits, the patient will receive intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs while her vital signs are precisely monitored for a total of 2 hours.\nFollow-Up Visit - During this safety follow-up visit, the principal investigator will evaluate the safety of the investigational product by conducting several assessments described in the Schedule of Assessments table.\nEnd of Study - At the end of the expanded access program visit, the principal investigator will conduct various evaluations to determine the patient's physical condition and assess whether there have been any safety events resulting from the participation in the expanded access program."
