Stem cells are a kind of pluripotent cells with the ability of self replication. The self-renewal and differentiation characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, as well as cytokine secretion effect and immune characteristics, provide the possibility for mesenchymal stem cells to treat ischemic stroke. After the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells, the secretion of soluble media including growth factors and cytokines may be the main mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of intravenous injection of ischemia tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic stroke. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ischemic tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ischemic stroke patients with neurological dysfunction."

                              "Stroke is a leading cause of disability. According to the comprehensive standardized prevalence estimation in 2016, 12.42 million people older than 40 years in China are currently suffering from stroke or have ever suffered from stroke. The overall prevalence rate of stroke in China was 1,596 per 100,000 people in 2016, 4.6 times higher than the rate of 345.1 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 70% of the survivors have disabilities in varying degrees. In addition to rehabilitation therapy, there is no therapeutic drugs of remarkable curative effect for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. The latest data show that the annual recurrence rate of ischemic stroke in China is as high as 17.7%.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in many clinical studies for different diseases. In addition to differentiating into multiple cell types and promoting the recovery and repair of the brain by replacing damaged cells, mesenchymal stem cells also secrete cytokines and neurotrophic factors to support and stimulate the growth of other endogenous cells. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. These characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells provide a new therapy for the treatment of stroke."
