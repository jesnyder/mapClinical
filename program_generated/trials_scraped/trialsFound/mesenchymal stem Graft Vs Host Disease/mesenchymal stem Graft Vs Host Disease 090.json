                              "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) refers to the clinicopathological synthesis of lymphocytes from the donor attacking the recipient's organs during the process of rebuilding the donor's immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) Signs (including classic cGVHD and overlap syndrome) are one of the main complications after transplantation, with an incidence of 30% to 70%. cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. main reason. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) About 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD.\n\nIn 2002, Frassoni reported for the first time that MSCs expanded in vitro were used to evaluate the efficacy of allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT transplanted patients with hematological malignancies were enrolled. MSCs were derived from the donor's bone marrow. After expanded in vitro, participants were combined with the donor's hematopoietic stem cells for reinfusion. As a result, the incidence of aGVHD in the MSCs expansion group and cGVHD within 6 months was significantly lower in the control group, the 6-month OS was significantly higher than that in the control group, and there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate. Subsequently, in 2004, Le Blanc and others successfully used third-party MSCs to successfully treat a refractory grade IV intestinal combined with liver aGVHD for the first time. Subsequently, MSCs were increasingly used in clinical studies for the treatment of GVHD. More clinical trials have shown that umbilical cord-derived MSCs cultured in vitro can not only promote the implantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), but also reduce the incidence of severe GVHD in patients, showing a good therapeutic effect."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) is the treatment of choice for many malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders. However, this treatment is frequently complicated by acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD), wich can be associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\nSteroids are still the first line treatment for established aGVHD, with a response rate of 30-50%, and there is no established and effective therapy for severe steroid-refractory aGVHD. The outcome for patients is poor and overall survival low, with few patients alive at 2 years.\n\nIn the case of failure after corticosteroid treatment, different therapeutic options have been introduced as second or third-line strategies. In this scenario, infusion of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has emerged as an additional tool for treatment of GVHD.\n\nMSCs are non hematopoietic multipotent cells with self-renewal properties and the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues. Several lines of evidence in the past few years have confirmed the ability of theses cells differentiate into cells derived form embryonic mesoderm, such as osteocytes, adipocytes and chondroblasts. In vitro, culture-expanded MSCs express membrane antigens that can be immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The most widely accepted antigen expression pattern is cluster of differentiation (CD) 29, CD105, CD73, and CD90 positivity in 97 % of cells and minimal expression of CD45, CD34, CD3, CD14, CD19, or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR, which should be positive in less than 3 % of cells.\n\nBecause they are easy to isolate and culture and due to their differentiation potential and production of growth factors and cytokines, MSC have become ideal candidates for regenerative protocols.\n\nThe purpose of this work is conduct a study in patients with refractory and/or resistant GVHD corticosteroids treatment. It will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive the MSCs and the other group will follow the acute GVHD steroid-resistant and/or refractory treatment according to the routines of the Bone Marrow Transplantation service of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. It will be evaluated aspects of immune recovery early after MSCs infusion.\n\nMETHOD: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open label study to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatment of steroid-resistant acute GVHD with MSC. All patients with refractory and/or resistant steroids GVHD will be included after signing of free and informed consent.\n\nAfter randomization, patients will be allocated to receive conventional treatment:\n\nBasiliximab 20mg dose for adults and 10mg for children, 1 time a week or every 3 days if worsens the stage of GVHD until reaching Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or for a maximum of 4 doses, whichever comes first.\nIf after the item (1) will not obtained VGPR: Infliximab 5 to 10 mg/kg dose, 1 time a week, four weeks or even VGPR.\n\nPatients in the study group will receive two infusions of MSC per week during two weeks and 1 more MSC infusion (2 + 2 + 1 scheme).\n\nAfter 28 days, if VGPR is not obtained, crossover between groups will be allowed as well as for the patients with progressive GVHD in spit of treatment arm, before day +28. The latter group of patients, who use both treatments (MSC + Conventional treatment) before day + 28 will be analyzed separately.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived MSCs from normal BMT donors (third part) will be isolated and expanded under conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice. The quality control involves immunophenotyping, differentiation, microbiological control, mycoplasma and endotoxin tests.\n\nPatients response evaluation will be at Day + 28:\n\nComplete response: disappearance of all symptoms\nPartial response: with a decrease at least of one degree of GVHD\nVGPR: decrease to the stage I of GVHD\nStable disease: when there is a stability of the disease\nNumber and type of infection in the first 100 days after transplant\n\nThe transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, overall survival and the development of chronic GVHD or not, will also be evaluated."

However, currently standard first-line regimen including cyclophosphamide and prednisolone is only effective for some patients. Novel treatment is urgently needed. Our previous study has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective for cGVHD patients with multiple skin damage. To further explore the therapeutic effect of MSCs for extensive cGVHD, we plan to conduct a multi-center clinical trial. Patients who developed an extensive cGVHD (with skin and/or liver damage) after HSCs transplantation and do not respond to first-line therapy are enrolled. They will be randomly divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and routine second-line drugs respectively.

More than one-third of patients with chronic GVHD do not respond to first-line therapy, which often involves combinations of corticosteroids and a calcineurin inhibitor.

Recently, MSCs have also shown unique immunomodulatory properties ex-vivo, including inhibition of T-cell proliferation after stimulation by allo-antigens and mitogens, and prevention of the activity of cytotoxic T cells.MSCs have been used for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD and for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD,but rarely have been used for extensive chronic GVHD.\n\nDevelopment of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with extensive chronic GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.\n\nIn this study, a single center randomized, non blinded Phase II clinical trial is proposed to study the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of extensive chronic GVHD newly or refractory to the usual therapeutic measures.\n\nExpanded MSC will be infused at a dose of 2 million cells/kg twice a week for 2 weeks and weekly for the following two weeks (six doses totally)in patients based first-line therapy (steroid plus cyclosporin A ) or their primary immunosuppressive therapies."

Some concerns exist about the heterogeneity of these nonclonal MSCs that are isolated and expanded by the conventional density-gradient centrifugation method. Recently, we developed a new protocol, called the subfractionation culturing method (SCM), to generate single-cell-derived clonal MSC (cMSC) lines from whole bone marrow aspirate without employing any centrifugation step for mononuclear cells and enzyme treatment process. This method allowed us to rapidly establish single-cell-derived human clonal MSC (hcMSC) lines from raw bone marrow aspirates and to establish a library of these hcMSC lines (Song et al., 2008).\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of allogeneic cMSCs established by the SCM and manufactured in GMP facility. This phase I clinical trial is a multicenter, single dose study of cMSC (1 x 10e6 cMSCs/Kg recipient's bodyweight). Clonal MSCs will be infused to acute or chronic GVHD patients via an intravenous injection. Every patients will receive the same treatment"

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\nBlood samples are obtained periodically and examined by immunoenzyme techniques for mixed lymphocyte reaction (as a surrogate marker for alloreactivity) and cytokine levels (TH1 [i.e., interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-gamma], TH2 [i.e., IL-10 and IL-4], and inflammatory cytokines [i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1]). Tissue specimens are examined by CD45 immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."

Nearly 50% (approximately 3,150) of these patients develop acute GVHD (Goker et al). A fraction of these patients (approximately 870) will progress to the severe stages of the disease, Grades III-IV. It is estimated that nearly 82% of those patients with severe acute GVHD will be steroid refractory (Przepiorka et al., 1995) and of these, only 50% of steroid-refractory patients will respond to secondary and tertiary treatments (Greinix et al., 2000). Thus, roughly 350 patients each year face tremendous odds against survival. In addition, most patients who initially responded to secondary and tertiary treatments have a high risk of dying within the first year (Remberger et al., 2001; Anasetti et al., 1994). Development of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with steroid refractory, acute GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.

                              "This is a pilot study evaluating the addition of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) infusions to corticosteroids for the early treatment of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is a major complication following allogeneic stem cell transplant. GVHD occurs when T-lymphocytes in the donor graft respond to signals from recipient cells and cause tissue damage. This process can lead to organ injury, increased risk of infection, and graft failure. Corticosteroids have been used as the primary therapy for acute GVHD for decades, and guidelines currently recommend their use as front line treatment. Recent prospective data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network shows that GVHD will be cured in about half of patients with steroids alone. Patients who do not respond to steroids are considered steroid-resistant, and this is associated with much worse survival. It is possible to predict which patients will go on to have steroid-resistant GVHD by measuring the plasma concentration of the molecule called suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2). BMSC infusions have been used to treat steroid-resistant acute GVHD successfully, but despite a track record of safety, little is known about the use of BMSC in the early treatment setting. The main objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of administering BMSC within 5 days of diagnosis of acute GVHD. Our study will for the first time use the ST2 biomarker to more accurately assign acute GVHD to steroid refractory or sensitive, and explore changes in ST2 and other biological markers of BMSC function and their correlation with clinical response. In the process of this study, we will assess the safety and feasibility of early treatment according to our regimen, obtain estimates of efficacy at important GVHD therapy time points, and determine if treatment with BMSC can prevent the progression of GVHD in patients with high risk of GVHD progression as measured by biomarkers.\n\nThe Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center NIH has developed a BMSC repository at NIH. The NIH BMSC are a third party, early passage product based on the EU manufacturing approach. The NIH BMSC cellular product was administered safely to transplant recipients with steroid-resistant acute GVHD in a phase I study (protocol 12-H-0010, IND #14596) conducted from March 2012 to October 2012 at NIH. This pilot study is a continuation of the previous study and open to allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients at NIH (age greater than or equal to 4 yrs) with de novo acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy either directly after allogeneic transplantation or following treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion. Subjects will receive BMSC infusions (target dose of 2 times 10(6) BMSC/kg for up to 12 doses) in addition to standard upfront therapy with corticosteroids. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients without a treatment-related severe adverse event (TRSAE) at day +56. Responses will be assessed at day +28 and +56 from the initial diagnosis. Responses will be correlated to changes in GVHD biomarkers including ST2, Reg3a, TNFR1, and IL-6. Subjects will be enrolled at first diagnosis of acute GVHD, and the first BMSC infusion will be given within 120 hours of the first dose of corticosteroids. BMSC infusions will be given twice weekly for the first 4 weeks. Subjects with a complete response at the end of week 4 will not receive further infusions. All other subjects will receive BMSC infusions weekly for four additional weeks. Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Research samples will be drawn at regular intervals to explore biological correlates of response and to investigate the mechanism of action of BMSC."

Acute GVHD is defined using the NIH consensus definition inclusive of classic acute (less than or equal to 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features) AND persistent/recurrent/late onset acute (> 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features). Subjects with stage I and II skin only (overall Grade I) or isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement are eligible if the treating physician deems that systemic corticosteroid treatment is indicated. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is desirable, but not required for study entry because enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results. Patients must be diagnosed with a first episode of acute GVHD requiring systemic corticosteroids and associated with preceding administration of a cellular therapy including stem cells and donor lymphocyte infusion. Patients who were treated for GVHD associated with another cellular therapy product (e.g. prior allogeneic transplant or DLI) will be allowed into the study.\n\nPrevious immunosuppressive therapy\n\nThe patient must have received no systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of new acute GVHD (e.g. pentostatin, etanercept, denileukin difitox, etc.), except for a maximum 120 hours prior corticosteroid therapy. This does not include immune suppressive therapy for GVHD prophylaxis (e.g. calcineurin inhibitor, sirolimus, MMF, etc.). It is expected that most patients will be receiving GVHD prophylaxis as part of their transplant regimen, thus patients developing acute GVHD while on GVHD prophylaxis will still be considered eligible. Concurrent or addition of locally-acting steroid therapy (skin creams, oral budesonide, or any other locally-acting steroid preparation) is allowed.\nThere is one exception to the above stipulations: Use of the oral medication MMF (in addition to systemic corticosteroids) for the treatment of acute GVHD will be allowed. MMF is commonly given early in the treatment of acute GVHD, but it has not been shown to improve outcomes compared to steroids alone in a randomized, prospective study; therefore, treatment with MMF will not exclude patients from BMSC treatment.\nAge: Age greater than or equal to 4 years old will be allowed.\nBirth control: Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are being treated on this study.\nInformed consent: Signed informed consent and/or assent is required. Assent and educational materials will be provided to, and reviewed with, patients under the age of 18. The informed consent process will begin at recognition of patient eligibility.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nBreast feeding or pregnant females (due to unknown risk to fetus or newborn).\nKnown allergy to gentamicin."

                              "Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant has become first choice of treatment for many malignant and non malignant haematological disorders. Although great progress has been made to prevent and minimize transplant-associated complications, yet graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains a significant complication affecting these the outcome in these patients. It is a severe inflammatory condition that arises when recipient tissues are attacked by immune mediated donor T cells during transplantation. Acute GVHD predominately affects the skin, upper and lower GI tract, liver and occasionally the eye and oral mucosa, whereas chronic GVHD resembles more with autoimmune disorders in its clinical symptoms. These symptoms can be organ-specific or generalized throughout body.\n\nThe pathophysiology of GVHD shows that it has different phases. In first phase i.e., afferent phase, damage to host tissue occurs. In second phase i.e., Induction and expansion phase, donor T cells are triggered and activated by recipient and donor APC as well as the inflammatory cytokines. Activated T cells produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 (or Th1 response). Allogeneic immune response is amplified by IL-2, which activates more T cells and natural killer cell responses, triggering macrophages to release TNF-\u03b1 and further inflammation damages skin and gut. The third phase i.e., effector phase, is characterized by cytotoxic damage against host cells by activated donor T-cell-mediated through Fas-Fas ligand interaction, perforin-granzyme and TNF-\u03b1. The latter has a central role in the pathophysiology, stimulating cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1). This dysregulation leads to the clinical manifestations of acute GVHD.\n\nThe cells involved in GVHD pathophysiology include CD4+ T cells; for maintaining the expansion of CD8+ T cells that mediate GVHD, APCs; these have role in the initiation phase of acute GVHD as described in murine models and Natural killer (NK) cells; contribute to tissue damage in the effector phase by releasing inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. However, natural killer cells mediate cell death by two important pathways: Fas-Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis and perforin-granzyme-B-mediated cytolysis.\n\nHLA differences between donor and recipient are the major predictor of GVHD. Other affecting factors include age, gender mismatch between donor and recipient, minor histocomapatability antigen expression difference(mHA) in otherwise identical HSCT, donor age, source and dose of stem cells (PBSCT greater risk than BM), intensity of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nSteroids are the first line therapy for acute GVHD patients and are standard treatment for grade II-IV acute GVHD. Adverse effects of glucocorticoids include hypertension hyperglycemia and psychosis, immunosuppression, infections, myopathy, osteoporosis and avascular necrosis of bone, cataracts and fat re-distribution etc. If acute GVHD is not improved after 5-7 days treatment with steroids then it is considered as steroid-refractory. Various agents that are being investigated from last two decades as second line therapy include low-dose MTX, MMF, extracorporeal photopheresis, IL-2R targeting, antibody therapy against CD3, CD7, CD25, CD52, CD147, IL-2R, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 (i.e., basiliximab, daclizumab, denileukin, diftitox and alemtuzumab), horse ATG, etanercept, infliximab, and sirolimus and recently infusions of mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as self-renewing, multipotent progenitor cells with potential to differentiate into other cell types of mesodermal origin, such as adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy developed the minimal criteria for definition of MSCs which is as follows: first, adherence to plastic; Second, positivity for the cell-surface molecules CD105, CD73, and CD90 and negativity for CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR; and third, the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts under standard in vitro differentiation conditions. Since Le Blanc and colleagues first reported successful treatment of a patient with severe acute GVHD using third-party haploidentical MSCs in 2004, many clinical trials worldwide have described the benefits of MSC therapy in GVHD.\n\nThe proposed project is a phase I/II clinical trial of single group, open label, interventional study design. The objective is to observe the safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of ex-vivo expanded bone marrow mesenchymal cells from a third party donor for treating refractory GVHD. The study will also document the type and frequency of any adverse event or side effects, if discovered."

                              "The curative potential of Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), when applied as a therapy in the management of hematologic malignancies, specifically, derives from an immunologically driven, graft-versus-tumor effect mediated principally by donor T-cells, and is associated with a lesser risk for relapse when compared to high dose chemo-radio therapy and autologous HCT. Donor derived T-cells are also responsible for mediating the occurrence of GVHD, a common transplant-related complication, affecting a significant percentage of patients undergoing allo-HCT leading to the destruction of host tissues. The standard initial treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD is steroid-based therapy. Unfortunately, many of these patients will become resistant to steroid therapy and will subsequently be treated with second-line immunosuppressive agents. De novo high-risk aGVHD and steroid-refractory aGVHD portends a very poor prognosis; second-line agents frequently prove ineffective, and as a result, survival is < 10% at 5 years. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed to treat aGVHD following allo-HCT, particularly in the setting of de novo high-risk acute or steroid-resistant disease.\n\nDue to the large numbers of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that can be obtained from the umbilical cord, the availability of this tissue, their higher growth rates and expansion capacity, and their immune properties, including: (1) low immunogenicity and lack of stimulation of allogeneic T-lymphocyte proliferation, (2) suppression of the proliferation of activated T-lymphocytes, (3) increased production of regulatory T-cells, and (4) a shift in the immune response towards tolerance, Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSC) may be a preferred option for MSC.\n\nThe rationale for cell dosing in this protocol is based on published data from Kebriaei, et al. Dosing at 2 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight produced a complete response in 87.5% of the treated patients. Dosing at a level 4 times higher (8 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight) produced no improvement in complete response results. However, the higher dose produced some partial response and no patient failed to respond to therapy. Therefore, the Phase I study for MSCTC-0010 is designed to increase the dose of WJMSC from 2 \u00d7 10^6 MSC to 10 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight, assuming no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at the lower dose."

The umbilical cord is one of the important sources of MSC. Human UC-MSC compared with the bone marrow-derived MSC has the following advantages: (1) the umbilical cord, as a \"waste\" after giving birth can be obtained without any harm to the donor. (2) easy available, and no ethical issues. (3) its likelihood of contamination is small because of the protection of the placental barrier. (4) human UC-MSC has a stronger amplification capacity, a shorter doubling time, a higher colony forming efficiency and lower immunogenicity. (5) which avoids the activity and differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSC latent with the donor disadvantage of increasing age decreased.\n\nhuman UC-MSC not only for hematopoietic stem cell graft implantation and amplification has a role in promoting and exhibit immunomodulatory effects and characteristics of damaged or targeted sites of chronic inflammation. human UC-MSC in the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced organ transplantation immune tolerance and other fields has broad application prospects.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of exploration, the investigators and other practitioners caught studies found that the umbilical cord is more suitable as mesenchymal stem cells seed cells relative to the bone marrow, umbilical cord easily obtained, no ethical issues, better amplification ability in vitro, viral contamination risk is small, and many other advantages. Therefore, over the years, the investigator team for the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in a lot of the basic work has been confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells derived from the umbilical cord had safety and effectiveness in in the treatment of acute graft versus host disease in zoology test, and successfully establish a perfect umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in standard operating procedures (including screening umbilical cord, large-scale preparation, quality inspection, preservation, recovery, transportation, infusion, etc.).

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for several hematological disorders. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, aGVHDremains a common and life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Corticosteroids are still acted as the first-line treatments of aGVHD, with a response rate of 50-80. However, those who failed to initial therapy only have 10-30% long-term survival.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from many tissues, such as bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Such cells possess the capacity to suppress immunological responses, support hematopoiesis and repair tissues. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly for preventing and treating GVHD. Although the results are still controversy, most prospective and retrospective data suggest that MSCs are effective to aGVHD.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors combined with CD25 monoclonal antibody and calcineurin inhibitors in treating patients with aGVHD."

Patients receiving HCT can develop a life-threatening condition called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donor T cells from the donor bone marrow recognize host cells as \"foreign\" and initiate an inflammatory immunological response. The standard of care for treatment of acute GVHD consists of intravenous delivery of methylprednisolone starting on day 1 and continuation of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. This regimen of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may relieve symptoms of GVHD, but some patients are refractory to current standard of care treatment. For treatment-refractory patients with grades III-IV GVHD mortality is approximately 80%. A therapy that could effectively suppress the immunological response from GVHD and help repair the damaged tissue could significantly decrease the mortality rate from this disease."

One of the major complications is the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). Thirty to eighty percent of patients after HSCT develop aGVHD despite the prophylactic application of different immunosuppressive drugs depending on risk factors such as HLA-match, donor relation, age etc.1-3.\n\nFirst line therapy of aGVHD > grade I consists of steroids at a dose of 2 mg/kg. The response rates to this treatment are only 15-35%4. In case of a steroid refractory aGVHD different therapeutic strategies have been evaluated, but with no satisfactory results so far. The mortality of patients suffering from steroid refractory aGVHD remains at 75-80%, although numerous studies with different treatment strategies have been conducted2-5. Therefore, it remains important to search for new therapeutical strategies for the treatment of aGVHD.\n\nThe first patient to receive mismatched Mesenchymal Stem Cells was a twenty-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia treated with peripheral blood stem cells combined with MSC from her haploidentical father. Lazarus et al. reported on 46 patients who received HSCs and culture-expanded MSCs from HLA-identical siblings. Moderate to severe acute GvHD was observed in 28% of the patients, and chronic GvHD was seen in 61%. The two-year progression-free survival was observed in 53% of the patients. MSC infusion caused no acute or long-term MSC-associated adverse events.\n\nTraditionally, for MSC isolation and expansion, fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented media are used. The use of FCS has however several drawbacks and potential problems. We have therefore established a MSC culture protocol in animal serum free conditions using human platelet lysate and human plasma instead.\n\nThe present phase I/II study is designed to gather further insight into the clinical benefit in 50 patients (adults and children) with GvHD exerted by MSC expanded with human platelet lysate and plasma"

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been utilized in the treatment and prevention of graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, studies on MSC use in alloSCT from haploidentical donors (haploSCT) have been limited.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim 1) to evaluate MSCs' efficacy in GVHD prophylaxis and effect on engraftment of the haploidentical graft, 2) to improve the success rate of haploSCT by further decreasing GVHD incidence and graft failure rate. With higher haploSCT success rates, haploidentical donors would be important alternative graft sources in patients without HLA-matched donors.\n\nForty patients who present to Ankara University, School of Medicine, Division of Hematology with hematological malignancies and have indications for haploSCT will be included in the study after informed consent is obtained. MSCs will be procured and isolated from donor bone marrows. MSCs will be isolated, cultured, and stored in the good manufacturing practice (GMP) laboratory in Ankara University Stem Cell Institute. Donor bone marrow will be harvested, four to six weeks prior to transplantation, for MSC isolation and culture. Patients will receive either an ablative or non-ablative induction regimen based on their age, diagnosis, and the disease status at the time of transplantation. Donor bone marrow will be harvested a second time on the day of transplantation and the procured bone marrow graft will be infused to the patient the same day. GVHD prophylaxis will include post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy) on days +3 and +4 (50 mg/kg/day), tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Stored MSCs will be infused to the patient on day +6. The endpoints include graft failure rate, GVHD incidence, transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, and overall survival.\n\nThe investigators aim to evaluate the utility of MSCs in improving haploSCT results and to enhance the reliability and success of haploSCT. Successful transplants from haploidentical donors would ameliorate the problem of matched donor paucity in countries with a limited number of hematopoietic stem cell donors, such as Turkey, and would establish haploidentical donors an alternative donor source for patients without matched donors in Turkey. As haploidentical donors may be parents or children, rapid and easy access to donors would decrease wait times for alloSCT. Moreover, national current account deficit may be reduced through using grafts obtained from haploidentical donors residing in Turkey instead of grafts from foreign stem cell/umbilical cord banks.\n\nIn this project, the investigators seek to develop clinical therapy applications in concordant with the ambition of \"renewal and repair of human cells, tissues, and organs through cellular therapy and cellular products\" that is included in the The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey 1003 Call for Projects."

This procedure has been used to treat adults and children with life-threatening hematological malignancies and congenital immunodeficiency disorders.\nIn HSCT, therapeutic goal is an elimination of disease and enrichment of regenerating capacity to achieve engraftments resulting in continued generation of functional blood elements from the engrafted living cells. Transplantation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cells originating either from adult bone marrow or from peripheral blood often leads to graft-versus host-disease (GvHD), opportunistic infections and graft failure after transplantation.\nIn HSCT, MSC have been used as a therapy for GvHD and other complications. The aim of MSC infusions in HSCT is to use the cells' immunomodulatory effects to promote engraftment and to reduce the immunological reactions giving rise to GvHD.\nThere is a growing interest in co-transplantation of MSC and HSC to improve the donor outcome in the unrelated HSCT condition."

At present, the standard first-line treatment of cGVHD is still hormone or combined with immunosuppressant of cyclosporine. The dry eyes related to cGVHD are treated with artificial tears, lacrimal punctum embolization, local immunosuppressant or even blepharoplasty to reduce dry eye symptoms. Although a variety of new immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies have been used in clinic, the overall efficacy is still unsatisfactory with apparent side effects, and the period of treatment is long with high-costs. Therefore, it is an urgent task for clinicians to explore new methods of cGVHD related dry eye therapy and improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients.\n\nExosomes are a kind of membrane vesicles secreted by parental cells, which can mediate the transfer of RNA, protein, DNA and other functional molecules between cells and regulate the function of target cells. The therapeutic potential of UMSC exosomes has been widely studied in diseases of liver, kidney, skin and so on. Previously, we found that UMSC exosomes can significantly alleviate the symptoms of dry eye in the dry eye animal model. At present, we plan to clarify its efficacy in clinical research.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to assess the alleviation of dry eye symptoms in patients with cGVHD after UMSC-exo treatment by measuring Ocular Surface Index Score (OSDI), and the second objective include the measurement of tear secretion amount, tear break time, the areas stained by fluorescent, ocular redness, tear meniscus and best corrected visual acuity.\n\nApproximately 27 study subjects will be recruited. The treatment group will receive artificial tears for 2 weeks to normalize the baseline, followed by intervention of UMSC-exo 10ug/drop, four times a day for 14 days. The follow-up visit will be 12-week, progression of dry eye will be measured."

                              "Severe aplastic anemia is characterized by severe deficiencies in peripheral-blood platelets, white cells, and red cells. These defects in mature cells occur because aplastic bone marrow contains severely reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells. To date, Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants are routinely used to treat patients with many different diseases, including various cancers and blood disorders, such as aplastic anemia. The main sources of HSCs are bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood. However, challenges include obtaining enough functional HSCs to ensure optimal engraftment, and avoiding immune rejection and other complications associated with allogeneic transplantations. Novel abundant sources of clinical-grade HSCs are therefore being sought.\n\nOur novel studies have demonstrated that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted rapidly (in 4 days) into AD-HSCs on a large scale (2X108-9 cluster of differentiation 34\uff08CD34\uff09positive cells) by transfection of small RNAs to the the early region 1A (E1A)-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines. In vitro, AD-HSCs expanded efficiently and resembled cord-blood HSCs in phenotype, genotype, and colony-forming ability. In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. we show that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted into AD-HSCs by transfection of small RNAs to the E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines.

In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. In the safety aspect, we saw no evidence of leukemia, teratoma and other cancers in the blood, testes and subcutaneous tissues of transplanted mice. More importantly, our preliminary data have shown that AD-HSCs can reconstitute hematopoietic function in five patients with severe aplastic anemia. Based on these premilitary studies,, we have determined to conduct a further clinical investigation in multiple medical centers. In this study we plan to enroll up to 90 patients, to make a comprehensive assessment for this new treatment regimen and to show it is equal or superior to the current immunosuppressive regimen. Patients will be in the study for one years for treatment and active monitoring. All patients will be followed until death."

                              "Liver transplantation is the only lifesaving intervention for patients with end-stage liver diseases. The current immunosuppressive agents reduce the incidence of acute cellular rejection; however, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term side effects of these regimens now has become a major challenge for liver transplant recipients and is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need, for example, increases in the incidence of bacterial, viral infections, nephrotoxicity with chronic renal impairment, de novo diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurotoxicity, hematological toxicity.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Current clinical trails demonstrated that the use of autologous bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) for renal transplanted patients resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function. Compared with BM-MSC, umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) may be the better choice for clinical application. One main reason is that the collection of BM-MSC from liver transplanted patients would be harmful for the patients. Moreover, the proliferative abilities of BM-MSC from patients with liver disease are deficient, whereas, UC-MSC can be obtained from discarded umbilical cords and can be produced on a larger scale. Our and other studies reported that the infusion of human UC-MSC are feasible and can improve liver function of liver fibrosis and liver failure.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the conditions in liver transplanted patients. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in liver transplanted patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus UC-MSC treatment. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus placebo. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After UC-MSC transfusion, patients are followed up at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and the evaluation of liver function recovery was performed."

                              "Oral mucositis (OM) is a reversible common painful and debilitating iatrogenic lesion due to anti-cancer therapy. Depending on the intensity and dose of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, stomatitis or oral mucositis can significantly contribute to the reduction of patients' quality of life. [1]. The purpose of radiotherapy or chemotherapy therapies is to target rapidly duplicating cells and this triggers unwanted effects on oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, skin, bone marrow, hair follicles, and the tissues adjacent to the target [2].\n\nOM can present with different characteristics of which the most common are edematous and ery-thematous areas, major ulcerations, pain and bleeding. In the most serious cases there is a diffi-culty in drinking, eating and speaking [3]. What is more, in severe cases it can damage patients' quality of life [4-5].\n\nFrom a biochemical point of view, OM are caused by different molecular patterns such as oxida-tion produced by nitric oxide which causes cell apoptosis or the action of cyclooxygenases, protein kinases, cytokines and nuclear factors. Another interesting aspect to consider is the presence of epigenetic risk factors that target DNA methylation. [6,7] Oral mucositis mainly affects the non-keratinized oral mucosa as it has a cell turnover of 14 days which is twice as fast as keratinized gingiva. The areas of the oral cavity in which it is generally difficult to find this type of lesions are the hard palate, the dorsum of the tongue and the keratin-ized gingiva as they have a slower cell turnover (about 24 days) [8-9] To prevent the manifestation of these side effects, the guidelines of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society of Oral Oncology have defined home and professional oral hygiene as the main tool to combat OM, candidiasis and the risk of second-ary infections [10-15]. Care must be taken in removing all those mechanical traumas that can cause iatrogenic lesions such as incongruous margins, incongruous prostheses and grinding bites. However, it is also important to pay attention to all those external agents aggravating oral health such as tobacco, alcohol, oral burns and UV rays for the lips. Zinc supplements have also been suggested to maintain cellular homeostasis or human recombinant Keratinocyte Growth Factor to prevent oral mucositis. [13,16] OM lesions can also lead to large ulcers that can be terribly debilitating for patients. Scientific as-sociations for the protection of cancer patients recognize a key role in pain control and the prophy-laxis or treatment of secondary infections [12-15]. The use of low-intensity laser (Low-Level-Laser Therapy) was also proposed, which thanks to photobiostimulation can enhance tissue healing, re-duce inflammation and limit pain [12-15-17]. Zinc supplements are cofactors for many enzymes maintaining cellular equilibrium, immune response, and wound healing. They are considered an antioxidant, that precludes oxidative damage to many biomolecules [19]. In the most debilitating and painful cases of OM it has been suggested the use of a 2% morphine mouthwash and 0.5% doxepin mouthwash [13]. Furthermore, according to a study by O. Muhammad et al. [20], the glycyrrhetic acid / povidone / sodium hyaluronate gel could provide a mechanical protective action to the mucous membranes with a consequent reduction in pain.\n\nGrowth factors have been widely used in various fields of medicine and dentistry with the aim of improving and accelerating healing processes. The use of non-transfusional blood components such as Plasma Rich in Fibrin (PRF) is of great interest as it contains platelets and leukocytes can promote neoangiogenesis, release chemotactic growth factors and some studies have shown that leukocytes have a factor protective even in situations where there may be a risk of osteonecrosis. [21-22] Aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of topical use of platelet gel rich in fibrin in clinical management and healing of oral mucositis in oncological patients in treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.\n\nREFERENCIES:\n\nSroussi HY, Epstein JB, Bensadoun RJ, et al.

It is recommended that all participants receive all six infusions. The discontinuation of investigational agent is allowed for GVHD worsening with subsequent need for salvage therapy. All infusions must be given at least 3 days apart.\n\nParticipants will be evaluated for efficacy and safety until death, withdrawal or 90 study days after randomization, whichever occurs first. Study will be unblinded and data analyzed at Day 90 post 1st infusion (Day 0) following final participant enrollment. Participants will be followed for safety for 12 months post 1st infusion (Day 0)."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many hematologic diseases. However, about 5-27% of patients would suffer from poor graft function (PGF) and more recipients might develop delayed platelet engraftment (DPE) after allo-HSCT. These complications are associated with considerable mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF and DPE usually involves hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or second transplantation, but these methods have dismal effect or even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs might be effective in the treatment of PGF.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF or DPE is unsatisfactory in our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF or DPE after allo-HSCT."
