                              "cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) about 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to have immunosuppressive properties. Following a bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant, a proportion of patients develop a condition called 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD). In this condition the transplanted cells recognize the recipient as foreign and bring about an immune-mediated destruction of tissues. The treatment for this condition is to use drugs that will cause immunosuppression. A small subset of these patients develop a severe form of GVHD (Grade III or IV) which, in spite of the best currently available treatment, is associated with eventual death in more than 90% of cases. The investigators propose to use infusions of expanded MSC from the donor to treat this condition. A few reports on this approach have already been published in peer reviewed journals and preliminary results appear to be promising. The investigators are also aware that larger trials have been initiated to study this. After getting written informed consent, the investigators will infuse expanded MSC into patients who develop steroid-resistant GVHD."

                              "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and is classified as acute (aGVHD) or chronic (cGVHD). aGVHD onsets within the first 100 days after transplant or with clinical features including erythema, liver dysfunction and oral mucositis, whilst cGVHD or persistent GVHD occurs in approximately 30-60% of transplant patients who survive their first year . Long-term five-year prognosis for cGVHD patients is poor with a 70% mortality rate. cGVHD manifests as an autoimmune-like disease affecting multiple sites, including skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and joints. The oral cavity is the second most common site to be affected with symptoms in 45-83% of cases. In the mouth a diverse spectrum of clinical features can be found for example mucosal lesions can affect almost any site, salivary gland dysfunction and restricted mouth opening. Short-term patients can experience mucosal sensitivity, malnutrition, problems speaking, increased caries risk, xerostomia, oral pain and a diminished quality-of-life. Long-term complications include secondary malignancies and perhaps early death. Clinical management seeks to alleviate the symptoms and improve quality-of-life but 50% of patients fail front-line systemic steroid therapy. Oral cGVHD can be treated with topical high potency corticosteroids and oral rinses, however these treatments are not always effective and carry a risk of systemic absorption. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) resident in adult and fetal tissues, such as the bone marrow have the capacity to form bone, cartilage, stroma, muscle and fat, are known to exhibit immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. MSC infusions have been used to treat disorders such as osteogenic imperfecta, cardiovascular disease and to heal large bony defects. Indeed, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs have led to infusions being used as a second-line treatment for GVHD patients, and our group has shown within a Phase II clinical trial, 55% aGVHD patients who failed front-line steroid treatment responded to MSC infusion these studies are going with cGVHD patients. The goal of this project is to perform a pilot study to determine whether MSC injections directly into mucosal lesions in patients with oral cGVHD are able to alleviate the symptoms and facilitate the reparative process."

                              "Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) which may cause acute life-threatening morbidity or chronic disabilities. Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating GVHD. Therefore, the investigator designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute or chronic GVHD."

                              "Background:\n\n- Sometimes after stem cells are transplanted, donor cells attack the recipient s cells and cause tissue damage. This is called acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Researchers want to see if bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) can help treat GVHD. BMSC can travel in the body and help repair tissue. The BMSC in this study were grown from bone marrow from healthy volunteers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test whether BMSC are safe to use soon after GVHD is diagnosed and to see how the body s immune system responds to BMSC.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- People over 4 years old who had a stem cell transplant at NIH and now have acute GVHD. People who have had certain previous immunosuppressive therapy may be ineligible.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They will have a GVHD exam, including skin and stool tests. They must have a functioning central line.\nParticipation will last 11 weeks: 4 8 weeks of cell infusions, then follow-up for the rest of the weeks.\nUp to 12 cell infusions:\nParticipants will come to the clinic twice weekly.\nThey will get medicine to prevent side effects (like Tylenol and Benadryl).\nBMSC will be given through a small plastic tube in an arm vein or through an IV catheter. It will last 20 60 minutes.\nParticipants will be monitored for 1 hour.\nFollow-up visits: Up to twice a week, participants will have physical exam and blood tests. They may have a GVHD exam.\nParticipants who have a tissue biopsy outside the study will be asked to send a sample to the study."

                              "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of economy and medical level, the number of cases of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) develops rapidly in China. In 2019, 12,323 cases of HSCT were completed in China, with allo-HSCT accounting for 9600 cases of which.\n\nHowever, Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the most common and serious complications after Allo-HSCT. The incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) is as high as 40%-60% in HLA-matched sibling transplantation, and the incidence is even higher in haplo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(haplo-HSCT) and unrelated donor transplantation. By Glucksberg grading standard, the 5-year survival rates of grade III and IV aGVHD are 25% and 5% respectively, indicating severe GVHD directly affects the survival of Allo-HSCT patients.\n\nThe first-line treatment for aGVHD is still glucocorticoid, while the effective rate is only 30%-50%. Moreover, due to immunosuppression and increasing risk of infection, the efficacy of second-line treatments including polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, immunotoxins, chemotherapy drugs, and light therapy for steroid resistant aGVHD is also poor, with the overall survival rate of 5%-30%.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells, which can promote engraftment and hematopoietic reconstruction by secreting a variety of hematopoietic promoting factors, expressing adhesion molecules supporting hematopoietic stem cells, guiding homing of hematopoietic stem cells and providing hematopoietic microenvironment. At the same time, MSCs can modulate immune responses by affecting the proliferation of T cells and the migration of T cells and DC, inducing the expansion of Treg cells, inhibiting the secretion of antibodies by B lymphocytes, and regulating the secretion of soluble factors such as NO and IDO. As a result of these characteristics and the poor immunogenicity, MSCs are a promising alternative treatment for GVHD.\n\nCurrently, UK and EU guidelines has recommended MSC as a third-line treatment for grade 2-4 acute GVHD, and the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived MSCs in the prevention and treatment of GVHD has also been reported by several transplantation centers in China.However, MSCs have not been used for first-line treatment of aGVHD. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs as the first line treatment in patients with aGVHD."

It has been shown (mainly for BM-MSC) that MSC can down-regulate T cells activation. This characteristic of BM derived MSC already has clinical implications and shows their potent effectiveness both in prophylaxis and treatment of resistant GvHD. Ongoing clinical trials of use bone marrow MSC for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD are successfully run on and some bone marrow donor registries included BM-MSC as a material for donation. According to our preclinical studies MSC from cells from marrow, placenta, umbilical cord vessels demonstrate similar pronounced immunosuppressive effect both with autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes. Our preliminary clinical experience shows that BM-MSC is an effective tool for treatment of steroid resistant GVHD. Present study aimed to demonstrate if human UC-MSC has in vivo immunosuppressive effect and can be used for GVHD treatment"

                              "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the treatment for many malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a serious life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. The outcome for patients with aGVHD is poor and overall survival is low. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as the major complication of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT), limits the application of this curative therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells, which are able to modulate immune response in vitro and in vivo, and have possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as aGVHD. MSCs obtained from umbilical cord (UC) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. In addition, UC-derived MSCs can be used for off-the-shelf use and are obtained without any harm to donors than bone marrow-MSCs. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs in patients with aGVHD."

                              "Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mediated by stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) which leads to donor T-lymphocytes activation and target tissue destruction, particularly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver in acute setting. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.\n\nObjective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics\u00ae umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.\n\nStudy design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.\n\nFor Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20 patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.\n\nCyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires."

As a common therapeutic line of action is not shared for steroid resistant GVHD, it is important to establish the toxicity and the feasibility of preparation and infusion of third party MSCs for acute steroid resistant GVHD and acute phases of chronic steroid resistant GVHD.\n\nA total of 10 patients (pediatric and adults) need to be enrolled in the study. Patients who present clinical signs of either acute or chronic steroid resistant GVHD will receive by intravenous infusion at least two fixed doses of mesenchymal stem cells with 5 to 7 days of interval one from the other, derived from HLA unrelated donor different from the HSC donor (third party donor) regardless of the rate of HLA mismatch.\n\nPrimary objectives are to establish the feasibility and the toxicity of preparation and infusions of third party MSCs for the treatment of steroid resistant acute and acute phases of chronic grade II-IV GVHD.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\nTo document the efficacy of MSC infusion in steroid resistant acute and acute phases of chronic GVHD grade II-IV.\nTo document the rate of GVHD recurrence in MSCs infused patients.\nTo document relapse of hematological malignancies post MSC infusions in patients undergoing MSCs treatment for steroid refractory GvHD.\nTo document the overall survival of MSC infused patients for steroid refractory GvHD."

A variety of second line immunosuppressive agents have been investigated but no optimal treatment has emerged. There is therefore a need for novel treatment strategies. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exhibit immunomodulatory properties and a recent pilot study suggests a response rate of 70% in steroid- refractory patients. In the present randomized study the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment will be further studied in patients with cGvHD."

Although an overall and disease free survival of 85% to 100%, can be obtained in allogeneic blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation using an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor, only about 25% of patients have such a donor.\n\nPURPOSE: In an attempt to avoid GVHD, reduce earlier infection rate and decrease regimen-related toxicity while maintaining better engraftment, this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient's own adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) or AD-MSC transdifferentiated HSC (AD-HSC) transplant after an immunosuppressive regimen in treating patients who have severe aplastic anemia.\n\nThe patient will be in the study for one year for observation and active monitoring. After treatment and active monitoring are over, the patient's medical condition will be followed indefinitely. The principle measures of safety and efficacy will be :\n\nPatient survival probability at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.\nEngraftment at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year\nIncidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and Incidence of earlier infection rate as well as other complications within 6 months and 1 years."

The purpose of the phase II trial is to compare the effect of MSC with standard of care in these patients. MSCs are a type of stem cells that can be taken from umbilical cord blood and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs being used for infusion in this trial are collected from healthy, unrelated donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory. Giving MSC infusions may help control the symptoms of COVID-19 related ARDS."

Despite the ability of current immunosuppressive agents to reduce the incidence of acute rejection, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term toxicity associated with current regimens for liver transplant recipients now is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Here, we evaluate umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) as an alternative immunosuppressive agents for liver transplanted patients, and examine if UC-MSC could improve the recovery of liver function."

                              "The present project aims at evaluating the capacity of MSC to improve one-year overall survival of patients transplanted with HLA-mismatched PBSC from related or unrelated donors after non-myeloablative conditioning.\n\nCo-infusion of MSC has been shown to facilitate engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) in an immunodeficient mouse model. In addition, it has been shown that infusion of third party MSC in HSC transplantation could be successfully used as treatment for grade II-IV steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.\n\nOne hundred and twenty patients with HLA-mismatched donors will be included over 6 years at multiple centers across Belgium through the transplant committee of the Belgian Hematological Society. The conditioning regimen will consist of fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI, followed by the infusion of donor HSC. Patients will be randomized 1/1 in double-blind fashion to receive or not MSC (1.5-.3.0 x106/kg) from third-party (either haploidentical family members or unrelated volunteer) donors on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression will combine tacrolimus and MMF. Except for the collection, expansion and infusion of MSC, the clinical management of the patient will not differ from that of routine NM-HCT."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is still the only treatment available to cure acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplasia. Allo-HSCT has an anti-tumor effect (called the graft versus leukemia effect= GVL) mediated by donor lymphocytes. This GVL effect is often associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several studies have shown that the relapse incidence is lower in patients developing chronic GVHD. These studies confirm the impact of donor immune system on leukemic residual cells. In fact, the relapse incidence increased in patients with no sign of GVHD. The investigators assume that leukemic cells probably use mechanisms to inhibit the allogeneic response. These escape mechanisms to immunosurveillance have been described in other malignancies. Out of context of the allo-HSCT, in acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasia, correlations between the severity of the disease and the presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or exhausted T cells (PD1 positive) in the bone marrow and in the blood of patients were described at the time of diagnosis or relapse. Myeloid Derived Suppressive Cells (MDSCs) have been described as capable of inducing Tregs and exhausted T cells in the tumor microenvironment.The investigators want to evaluate the role of myeloid suppressive cells in bone marrow after allo HSCT. They hypothesize that their presence in bone marrow and / or blood recipient is correlated to the relapse incidence."
