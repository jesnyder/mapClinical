                              "Utilizing the osteogenic properties of both platelet rich fibrin matrix and peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration would be novel and may be advantageous than using Platelet rich fibrin matrix alone. The literature search does not show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new material i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the addition of a patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this seems to be an additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human mandibular periodontal intraosseous defects."
