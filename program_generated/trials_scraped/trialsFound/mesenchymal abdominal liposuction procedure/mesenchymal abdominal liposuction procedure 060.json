                              "In 1990, the prevalence of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee was very low 3.5% in Saudi Arabia, it increased to 53.3% and 60.9% in male in female patients respectively in 2002. The existing management of OA is conservative and pharmacological management aiming to relief symptoms of osteoarthritis and improves joint function. Results of a Meta-Analysis showed that mesenchymal stem cell is effectiveness and safe to treat knee osteoarthritis. In 1990, the prevalence of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee was very low 3.5% in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and it increased to 53.3% and 60.9% in male in female patients respectively in 2002. Results of a Meta-Analysis showed that mesenchymal stem cell is effectiveness and safe to treat knee osteoarthritis. This study will be a single center phase II-one arm clinical trial. It will be conducted at KF SH&RC-Jeddah. 18 participants will be recruited from orthopedic clinics. Participate will be evaluated before inclusion in the study. Participants will be exposed to e abdominal liposuction procedure under local anesthesia for stem cells harvesting. Stem cells will be separated from fat cells in the adipose tissue then activated in Tissue Culture Lab at Research Center- Jeddah. The activated stem cells will be injected into the knee joint via 22G spinal needle. The intra-articular stem cells injections will be performed under Ultrasound guidance at the theater under spinal anesthesia. Each patient will receive 1.0\u00d7 108 stem cells in 3 mL of normal saline"

Moreover, fat contains different cell types, including adipocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and adipogenic progenitor cells called\"preadipocytes\"2, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) which have a differentiation potential similar to that of other mesenchymal stem cells and it could be harvested in great amounts with minimal donor-site morbidity, ASCs have proved to be particularly promising for regenerative therapies. In addition, it's relatively inexpensive and readily available, which makes it an attractive alternative for facial augmentation.\n\nOn the other hand PEEK is considered a highly biocompatible material with mechanical properties almost similar to cortical bone. It is widely used in cranioplasties and facial reconstruction."
