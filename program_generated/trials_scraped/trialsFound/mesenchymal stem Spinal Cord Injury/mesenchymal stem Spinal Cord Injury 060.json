                              "The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue. Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized, single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed."

Bone marrow (BM) contains several types of stem cells that can produce functional cells. This includes cells that could help the healing process of damaged neurologic tissue.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to see if the injection of these cells, obtained from your own bone marrow, is safe. A secondary objective is to evaluate if the treatment can provide functional improvements (neuromuscular control and sensation) in the affected areas."

                              "Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that leads to permanent functional and neurological deficits in injured individuals. The limited ability of the Central Nervous System (CNS) to spontaneously regenerate impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery of the spinal cord. The leading causes are motor-vehicle crashes, sports-associated accidents, falls, and violence-related injuries.\n\nUnfortunately, there is still no effective clinical treatment for SCI. In recent years, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine based approaches have been proposed as alternatives for SCI repair/regeneration. Mesnchymal stem cells (MSC) use in SCI showed promising results in several studies. Our aim is to assess and compare the safety and effectiveness of autologous BM-MSC vs autologous AT-MSC in these patients."

                              "This protocol is part of an FDA Individual Patient Non-emergency Expanded Access Request submitted on behalf of a 38-year-old father and husband who on August 4, 2017 at about 4:30pm, slipped off a boat head-first while in the Florida Keys for a family wedding, and was immediately unable to move his legs. He was emergently transferred to Miami, FL for stabilization and treatment, where he was diagnosed with a C5 -C6 Grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6: 7mm, with flexion teardrop fracture of the anterior aspect of C6, as well as jumped facet on the right and perched facet on the left at C5-C6 with spinal canal stenosis with cord compression, as well as with aspiration and near drowning. He underwent ACDF (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion) of C5-C6 and reduction of jumped facets and was immediately started on a hypothermia protocol to reduce spinal cord edema. His hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia. He discharged to Texas via air ambulance for physical rehabilitation on August 23, 2017 with a diagnosis of ASIA B (American Spinal Injury Association) C-5 SCI (spinal cord injury)."

                              "The morbidity of spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing significantly in China. The methods to treat SCI patients in sequela stage update are poor. Though traditional rehabilitation therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, its effect to improve the neurological disorders of these patients, such as the dysfunction of sense, motor, autologous adjustment of blood pressure control of urination and defecation, perspiration , etc. is unsatisfying. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function. Studies show that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can remarkably improve the neurological function of SCI in animals without any severe side effect.\n\nIn this study, the investigators use mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord to treat 40 SCI patients (20 cases in early stage and 20 cases in sequela stage). The investigators also follow-up ten patients who only receive rehabilitation and another ten outpatients who accept neither stem cell therapy nor rehabilitation. On this basis, the investigators can compare the efficacy of these two treatments."

                              "There is evidence that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) can differentiate into oligodendrocytes and neurons, and improve the recovery of nerve function, which strongly suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of hUCB-MSCs as an intervention treatment for spinal cord injury. At present, there are only a few clinical centers in which hUCB-MSCs transplantation for treatment of chronic spinal cord injury has been performed and a certain degree of efficacy has been achieved. However, this has not been supported by systematic standardized randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the investigators design a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs to treat spinal cord injury. The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the locomotor function of patients with spinal cord injury. The secondary objectives were to investigate whether hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the muscle tension of patients with spinal cord injury and investigate the complications and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation."

Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of lower extremity amputations in the industrialized world. The lifetime occurence of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) is 20% in diabetic patients.\n\nBetween 15% - 25% of the foot ulcers will lead to lower limb amputations.\n\nIt has been shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) could be an effective therapy for many diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, spinal cord injury, liver injury and critical limb ischemia.\n\nStem cells can be obtained from either the patient (autologous) or non-related healthy donors (allogeneic).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of cultured Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSCs) from allogeneic donors for treatment of chronic leg wounds of diabetic patients."

                              "Background:\n\nImproving implantation rates in ICSI cycles has been the focus of research in recent decades. Because success rates is not satisfactory enough especially when transferring good embryos to the uterine cavity and pregnancy does not occur. Trying to improve endometrial receptivity, the investigators have thought about stem cell therapy as stem cells have played a pivotal role in regenerative medicine in many pathologies as myocardial infarction, Diabetes Mellitus and spinal cord injuries.\n\nGarget and Healy reported in 2011 treatment of a case with Asherman's syndrome by administration of bone marrow stem cells in the uterine cavity. Endometrial growth and improved vascularity has been observed by ultrasound follow-up and Doppler study of endometrial blood flow. Endometrial regeneration has been enough to support pregnancy through successful IVF trial.\n\nThe investigators have succeeded in previous work to isolate MSC from placental tissue and differentiate it to endometrium-like cells. The investigators compared the differentiation ability of placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Wharton Jelly derived MSC to differentiate to endometrium under 3 different culture conditions: endometrium conditioned medium (ECM), follicular fluid (FF) conditioned medium and medium containing both. The investigators found that placental MSC has better differentiating ability to endometrium especially under culture conditions containing both ECM and FF as evidenced by prominent appearance of glandular pattern and expression of progesterone receptors in differentiated cells.\n\nTherefore the investigators need to direct this study and test the effect of placental derived MSC in improving implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure, unresponsive endometrium to ovulation induction drugs or with endometrial atrophy or advanced maternal age planning for ICSI trial.\n\nPatients and Methods:\n\n60 patients attending Kasr El-Aini assisted reproduction unit and private IVF center will be randomized to three groups by computer generated programs:\n\nThe first group, patients randomized to receive differentiated stem cell therapy:\n\nAfter ovum pick-up, MSC differentiated to endometrium is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter. Embryo transfer will be done at day 5 at the blastocyst stage to allow enough time for endometrial regeneration and increased endometrial receptivity.\n\nThe second group, patients randomized to receive undifferentiated stem cell therapy:\n\nImmediately postmenstrual undifferentiated MSC is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter to allow enough time for the MSC to differentiate as it needs 7-10 days for differentiation. Ovum pick-up will be done as usual while all other steps will be the same including embryo transfer which will be done at day 5.\n\nThe third group, control group:\n\nPatients are randomized to receive no stem cell therapy; All ICSI steps from ovulation induction protocol to embryo transfer conditions will be the same for all groups.\n\nInformed consent will be taken from the patients after detailed explanation of all steps of the procedure."
