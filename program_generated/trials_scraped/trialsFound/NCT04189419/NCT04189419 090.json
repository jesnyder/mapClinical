Efficacy and safety are assessed daily for the first week, and then weekly on 3 occasions (Day 14, 21, and 28). Survival is followed up until Day 90.\n\nPhase II (Multicenter in Korea, Randomized, Double-blind, 2-arm, Placebo-controlled, Parallel arm): Eligible patients will be randomized to the SCM-AGH group or placebo group at 1:1 ratio. Total 36 patients with Moderate to Severe Acute Pancreatitis are planned to be enrolled from 12 sites in Korea. Subjects will receive SCM-AGH on Day 0, 1, and 2. Existing standard of care is permitted. Efficacy and safety are assessed daily for the first week, and then weekly on 3 occasions (Day 14, 21, and 28). Survival is followed up until Day 90."
