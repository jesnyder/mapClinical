One group will be treated with scar revision only (control group or group I), 2nd group will be injected with PRP after scar revision, 3rd group will be injected with ADSCs after scar revision and the 4th group will be injected with a combination of PRP and ADSCs after scar revision. All groups were assisted pre-operative and six months post-operative. Complications, Scar width, Vancouver scar scale (VSS), surgeon assessment scar scale and patient assessment scar scale will be considered the outcome measurements."
