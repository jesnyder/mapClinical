                              "Small volume lipoaspiration will be performed. This technique involves harvesting small amounts of fat by making a small incision in the donor site (usually the abdomen) and infiltrating 25-75cc of tumescence solution (1 liter of LR, 30 cc of 1% lidocaine, 1 ampule of 1:1,000,000 epinepherine) into the adipose layer with a blunt infiltrator. The Coleman aspiration Cannulae, approximately 2-3 mm in diameter and 15 cm in length attached with a Luer-Lok suction syringe will be used to harvest up to 100 cc of fat. Gently pulling back on the syringe provides a small amount of negative pressure to allow for aspiration into the syringe.For the intervention wound, the adipose tissue will be implanted using the infiltration Cannulae (blunt end, 7 cm- COL-17) or the both approx. 1mm in diameter. The implantation will be in single tunnels radially around each wound spaced at 5-10 mm apart and approximately 3 - 5 cm in length.",
                              "For the control wound, only the sterile injectable tumescence solution (1 liter of LR, 30 cc of 1% lidocaine, 1 ampule of 1:1,000,000 epinepherine) will be used. The solution will be injected in a similar fashion with single tunnels radially around the control wound spaced at 5-10 mm apart and approximately 3 - 5 cm in length."
