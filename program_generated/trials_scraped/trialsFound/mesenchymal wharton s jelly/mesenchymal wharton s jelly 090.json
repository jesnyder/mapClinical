                              "This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell infusion as a treatment in patients with systemic sclerosis refractoryto conventional therapy. The group of patients will be collected from the database of families of Stem Regenerative Medicine according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and verified in the academic committee.\n\nThe administration will be intravenously, with a concentration of 2 X 10^6 mesenchymal cells per kilogram of patient weight. The infusions will be carried out nested at cyclophosphamide application cycles ten days after each application of the cyclophosphamide schedule for each patient. To assess safety and therapeutic effects, the occurrence of any adverse event will be described from start of infusion until the conclusion of the trial in six months.\n\nTo assess the response, a pre-infusion and sixth-month post-infusion instrument will be applied that includes clinical variables, paraclinical and hemodynamic tests to evaluate skin involvement using the modified RODNAN score, changes in nail capillaroscopy, lung function and structural involvement by high-resolution chest tomography (hrCT), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and a 6-minute walk. As part of the cardiovascular assessment, cerebral natriuretic peptide (BNP), transthoracic echocardiogramwill be performed; The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review(CAMPHOR) and Sysq will be used as tools for the assessment of pulmonary hypertension. A comparison of these tests before initiation of therapy and after completion of 24 weeks of infusion scheme should be performed."
