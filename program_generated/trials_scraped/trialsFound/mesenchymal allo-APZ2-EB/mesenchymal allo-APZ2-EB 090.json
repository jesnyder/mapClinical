To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-EB one follow-up visit at Month 12 and one follow-up visit at Month 24 post IMP applications is included.\n\nDetermination of the EB linked symptoms and quality of life will be assessed by using the EBDASI score, the iscorEB, the change in pain and itch perception, and patient's quality of life in EB. The wound healing process will be documented by photography."
