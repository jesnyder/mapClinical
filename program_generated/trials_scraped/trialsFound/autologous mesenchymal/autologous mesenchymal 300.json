Data analysis will be performed separately on the knee osteoarthritis subgroup and on the focal chondral defect subgroup. This will consist of a comparison of mean values for VAS scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months. Clinically significant outcomes will be determined based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) occurring for each respective scale, which is defined as the smallest change score needed for the effect to be considered clinically relevant; described below. Specifically, VAS represents a patient-reported measurement tool used to quantify perceived level of pain, graded on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worse pain possible.",

KOOS is a qualitative assessment of knee pain, stiffness, function, and quality of life within the last week. The IKDC is a quantitative assessment of knee symptoms with daily and sporting activities with a high score of 100 representing no limitations or pain, with lower scores signifying pain or limitations in knee function. The Lysholm score rates knee pain and symptoms with a high score of 100, with scores > 90 representing excellent function and scores <65 representing poor function.",

T1 rho values increase as degenerative changes worsen; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, it is expected that T1 rho values would increase. T2 mapping values primarily reflect changes in water content and collagen anisotropy. Focal areas of increased T2 mapping values correlate with focal areas of cartilage damage; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, T2 mapping values would decrease. Clinically significant changes will be observed by comparing T1 rho and T2 values in areas of relatively preserved hyaline cartilage within our patients with the areas of degenerative change to utilize an internal control. Data analysis will consist of a comparison of mean values for quantitative T1 rho and T2 mapping data pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 12 and 24-months."

It is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity The instrument is presented by a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (symptom, pain, health) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the \"no pain\" anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. No pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm) (11).",

Electrodes for recording were placed at the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa (Erb') and 1-2 cm above the spinous process of C7 and C4' (for recording of somatosensory evoked potential on the left median nerve) or C3' (for recording of somatosensory evoked potential on the right median nerve). Recordings were made separately on the left and right sides. 200 potentials on each body side were recorded and superimposed. Results of recordings will show whether the latency is apposite or similar with normal."
