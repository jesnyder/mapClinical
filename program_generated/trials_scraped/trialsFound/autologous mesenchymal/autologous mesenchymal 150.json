MSCs can be found in bone marrow and in the fatty tissues (i.e., area under the skin of the belly or breast) of patients. Fibrin glue is a product made from the naturally occurring compounds in blood which cause clotting. This glue hardens into a gel-like substance into which cells such as cartilage cells (chondrons) and AMSCs can be placed."

MSC colony formation, which is known as marrow-like stromal cells and MPCs, is similar to fibroblast colony forming unit (CFU-F) in in vitro condition. According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), MSCs can be easily detected or identified from other cells using flow cytometric analysis to detect specific surface markers"

The adipose tissue is the centrifuged at 920 \u00d7 g for 3 min in sterile conditions. Only the intermediate layer containing adipocytes and stromal vascular component will be then injected using a blunt cannula.

The bone marrow will be obtained according to standard practice for Hematologists of the Haematology University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca (HCUVA).\n\nMononuclear bone marrow cells were separated and cultured in GMP conditions (Good Manufacturing Practices). The cells are seeded on tricalcium phosphate and maintained in culture for 14 days.\n\nThe day when the implant is performed, the patient is prepared in the operating room. The area where the implant will be placed is cleaned. Mesenchymal cells seeded in tricalcium phosphate are mixed with demineralized bone matrix and It's coagulated with autologous platelet rich plasma and grafting is performed. Finally, the oral mucosa or skin will be sealingly closed by silk sutures."
