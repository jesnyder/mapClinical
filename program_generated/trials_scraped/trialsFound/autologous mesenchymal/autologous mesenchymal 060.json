Survivors are typically left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness, quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No agent has been found to be highly effective in halting disease activity.Based on recent outcomes of Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, and based on the mechanisms of neuromyelitis optica, the investigators anticipate that mesenchymal stem cells transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for neuromyelitis optica patients."

                              "\u2022 The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous MSC application for the therapy of drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy. Adult (18-60 years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from refractory epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included in this study. The pts were randomized to the standard treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (control group, 30 pts) or anti-epileptic drugs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (study group, 30 pts). The pts in the study group received one intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded MSCs (40-101 x 106 cells) and one subsequent endolumbal injection of neuroinduced MSCs (2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cells). Both the unfavorable reactions to MSC infusions and the clinical effects, including complications, were examined. The unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS; i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia).The possible beneficial effects of therapy in the two groups of pts were examined based on clinical observations and electroencephalography measurements (prior and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy). To determine potential changes in disease progression, the signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and particularly, changes in seizure character and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The main points of disease monitoring were \"yes\" or \"no\" responses (to therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to evaluate electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves based on standard and additional criteria. The paroxismality index, the peak frequency of EEG activity, the index of slow activity, and the summarized points of EEG pathology signs were calculated for each patient. All assessments were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to identify the potential differences between the two pts groups. Therapy was terminated when immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The final observation of each patient included clinical and EEG assessments at the time point of 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy."

These two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Universitario del R\u00edo Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. A phase I / II clinical trial with 10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region is proposed. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Follow up tests will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan."

They are undifferentiated \"blank\" cells that do not yet have a specific function. Under proper conditions, they begin to develop into specialized tissue and organs. They are self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. They serves as a sort of repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish other cells as long as the person is still alive. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility and elevated serum gonadotropins. POF occurs in 1 % of women. In majority of cases the underlying cause is not identified. Management essentially involves hormone replacement and infertility treatment. This work aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous MSC transplantation in women suffering from Premature Ovarian Failure."

There is no effective treatment, and the disease usually progresses to death within 2 to 4 years. The therapeutic plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be an attractive therapy to this complex disease, turning MSCs strong candidates for cellular therapy in ALS.\n\nDesign-A phase 1 open-safety clinical trial. 4 patients will be selected according to a restricted inclusion and exclusion criteria and after 2 escalated infusions of MSCs, there will be a follow up period of one year Methods - Primary endpoint: safety of mesenchymal autologous stem cells infusions escalated in two intrathecal administrations in patients with ALS defined as severe adverse events (SAe). Secondary endpoints: clinical response, laboratorial and magnetic resonance imaging of patients submitted to cellular escalating doses applied in the study. Quality of life, according to El Escorial criteria, ALSFR scale and functional scales.\n\nConclusion: This study is a primary step before a large randomized double-blind clinical trial for ALS. It is expected to confirm the safety of escalated MSCs therapy in ALS patients, initial data of efficacy in addition to improved quality of life."

                              "Despite the recent advances in medical and surgical treatment, heart failure resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) remains the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow.This study aims to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population."

The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial in 50 patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

                              "Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that leads to permanent functional and neurological deficits in injured individuals. The limited ability of the Central Nervous System (CNS) to spontaneously regenerate impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery of the spinal cord. The leading causes are motor-vehicle crashes, sports-associated accidents, falls, and violence-related injuries.\n\nUnfortunately, there is still no effective clinical treatment for SCI. In recent years, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine based approaches have been proposed as alternatives for SCI repair/regeneration. Mesnchymal stem cells (MSC) use in SCI showed promising results in several studies. Our aim is to assess and compare the safety and effectiveness of autologous BM-MSC vs autologous AT-MSC in these patients."

                              "Diabetes is a major concern in public health because of its high frequency and its negative consequences. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is present, regardless of age, in 50 to 75% of men with diabetes. It is related to endothelial dysfunction and a decrease in smooth muscle and nerve cells. In type 1 diabetic patients, ED is part of the chronic complications of microangiopathy. Current therapies are exclusively symptomatic with moderate efficacy, estimated between 44 and 56%. The administration of culture-grown medullary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would be a curative treatment and have the advantage of being single injection.\n\nHowever, the data in the literature do not allow to define the optimal dose of MSC in this indication. In addition, the feasibility of this procedure is not known at present.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy of intracavernous injection of autologous MSC (bone marrow-derived MSCs) administered in a 4-dose-escalating design in patients from 18 to 50 years old with complicated type 1 diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction."

MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as umbilical cord, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. The multipotent properties of MSCs make them a promising option for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).\n\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSC) have been used separately to treat OA. The aim of the present study will be to compare in a randomized non blind controlled clinical trial 3 types of intra-articular injections containing MSC populations obtained from two clinically relevant sources: BM-MSC, AD-MSC and a combination of both BM-MSC and AD-MSC."

Recently, cellular therapy is a new and popular medical treatment around the world, one of them is \"Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)\". MSCs are found in many tissues of human body and play an important role for repairing, regeneration, anti-inflammatory and chondrogenesis. So, MSC product, RegStem, for osteoarthritis treatment becomes a developing target for new generation drugs.\n\nThis study is to isolate and expand MSCs(RegStem) from infrapatellar fat pad of subject. When the number of MSCs expands to 1\u00d710^8, cell will be cryopreserved in the liquid nitrogen tank until all release tests passed. On the distribution day, cell will be thawed and injected into joint cavity of patient (5\u00d710^7). Subjects will be monitored after MSC product infusion of seven days, one month, six months and one year. The monitoring items include the changes of knee (by appearance, X-ray and MRI of knee) and pain improvement (by questionnaire)."

No study was done in humans with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic effect of BM-MSCs in alcoholic cirrhosis as Phase II clinical study.\n\nMethods: Eleven alcoholic cirrhosis patients (M:F = 10:1) with Child-Pugh's class B and maintenance of alcohol abstinence at least 2 months were enrolled. At baseline, all patients received liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and serologic tests. BM-MSCs were isolated from each patient's BM and amplified for one month and injected two times at 4, 8week through Rt. hepatic artery. 5x106cells/mL of BM-MSCs were injected in each session. Follow up biopsy, HVPG and relative expression of tissue transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-\u03b21), \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen-1 by real time RT PCR were measured after 12weeks from 2nd BM-MSC injection. The primary outcome was improvement in patients' histology Aim :\n\nThe researchers aimed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of new therapy with bone marrow derived autologous mesenchymal stem cell for hepatic failure caused by alcoholic liver cirrhosis."

                              "Bone fractures heal most of the time particularly well and without complications. The solidification takes rarely more than two to three months. The wound healing depends greatly on a good blood supply and needs several steps. These processes culminate in a new mass of heterogeneous tissue which is known as the fracture callus. Unfortunately, 2%-5% bone fractures cannot achieve a proper solidification and between the ununited fragments a scar tissue appears. This incorrect healing induces pain and even infections. When this situation persists more than 6 months, it is referred to as nonunion fracture, which will require some form of intervention to stimulate the natural healing process of the body. First of all, good surgical techniques with stable immobilization should be applied and local infection should be excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Cell therapy with bone marrow cells has emerged as a promising new approach for bone regeneration. Animal studies as well as preliminary human studies have shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells, a particular kind of stem cells isolated from the bone marrow, could induce callus formation when injected in the nonunion site of a broken bone.\n\nIn this study the investigators aim at determining whether Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) isolated from the patient's bone marrow and injected in the nonunion site could be a safe and effective treatment for nonunion fractures. Patients will be randomized in two groups; one injected with Mesenchymal Stem Cell and the other injected with placebo. The investigators seek also to know how long it takes to develop the callus formation and whether there is a partial or a complete callus formation."

                              "Although, effective immunotherapies for MS exist which downregulate the anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of the disease, there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce remyelination. Neuronal stem cells were shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.\n\nIn this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and restoration of neuronal function.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.\n\nSignificance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in general."

                              "The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue. Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized, single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed."

                              "Immunomodulatory therapies to treat the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS) are designed to ameliorate the inflammatory processes that mediate the damage to the central nervous system (CNS) and to delay progression of the disease. To date, there is no effective means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single injection of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the effects of BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological, immunological and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow aspirates, purified by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single dose of autologous BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and immunological assessments will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at 1, 3, and 6 months after transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after transplant. Proposed trial will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a feasible and safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an environment of immune tolerance and through the local production of neurotrophic/growth factors, might induce neuroprotection and improvement in CNS function."

                              "Many patients with osteoarthritis of the knee fail non-operative measures and elect to have knee arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. If successful, intra-articular mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections into the knee may offer another viable non-operative treatment modality. Additionally, this modality may have reparative or regenerative potential, which could lead to the first treatment for osteoarthritis that treats the underlying disease as opposed to symptomatic control.\n\nAdditionally, there are no acceptable non-surgical treatments for focal chondral defects of the knee. Surgical treatments that do exist have diminished outcomes if performed on patients older than age 30-40 years. If successful, intra-articular MSC injections into the knee would represent the first non-operative treatment for focal chondral defects and also represent a potential option for treatment in patients over the age of 30-40 years.\n\nThis trial will be a prospective, single-center phase I pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in 16 subjects, 8 who have knee osteoarthritis and 8 who have a focal chondral defect in the knee. Patients will undergo a bone marrow harvest procedure at the Dahms Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MSCs will be isolated and expanded. After approximately 2-3 weeks, patients will return for an intra-articular injection of 50x106 MSCs Subsequent study visits will occur on post-injection day 7 and months 2, 6, 12, and 24. Safety of intra-articular injection of MSCs will be evaluated at study visits by interval history, physical examination and assessment of any adverse events that are observed/reported. Additionally, efficacy will be evaluated by having patients complete functional outcome measures including: Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and Lysholm Knee Scale. These will be completed at the pre-treatment visit and then repeated at the 2, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up visits. Lastly, T1 rho and T2 mapping on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess for improved cartilage quality after intra-articular injection of MSCs. An MRI will be obtained at the pre-treatment visit. At the 12 and 24 month follow up visit, additional MRIs will be obtained and analyzed to compare the pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MRIs."

                              "Lipodystrophies are part of a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by loss (lipoatrophies) and / or accumulation of fat, which usually results in a change of normal tissue surface. Millions of plastic and reconstructive surgeries are performed annually to repair soft tissue defects due to trauma, tumor resection and congenital defects. Surgical options for lipoatrophy, the lipodystrophy type characterized by subcutaneous adipose tissue atrophy, include: Transfer of autologous fat, Dermis - fat graft, Skin flaps and Commercially available fillers.\n\nCurrently, the most commonly filler agent used for the lipodystrophy treatment is polymethylmethacrylate, considered permanent and with a history of short- and medium-term adverse effects. Biocompatible and temporary filler agents such as hyaluronic acid, polylactic acid and collagen have been used for over 25 years for cosmetic purposes and in lipoatrophies. More recently, the use of autologous fibroblasts proved to be efficient solving acne scars and enabling dermis regeneration. Studies in mice showed that the combination of pre - adipocytes with a biomaterial is much more effective in tissue reconstitution than the injection of adipose tissue only, providing volume and also stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation with increased production of extracellular matrix.\n\nThis project aims a phase I clinical trial of a filler agent, composed of mesenchymal stem cells derived from autologous adipose tissue associated with hyaluronic acid."

                              "Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination. The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs. Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin.Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow derived MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur center will perform a clinical trial with intra venous transplantation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell.our purpose is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of cell transplantation after 1year following up."

Numerous techniques have been developed ranging from invasive interventions (including internal fixation with the use of bone graft or bone graft substitutes) to non invasive procedures (ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic fields).\n\nRecently, autologous cell therapy was presented as an interesting approach. The concept of such therapies is based on the effect of stem cells presented in the bone marrow and able to be transformed in osteoblast cells. The purpose of this study is to find if mesenchymal stem cells can stimulate bone regeneration in nonunion and delayed union fractures to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing."

GVHD is when the graft (transplanted bone marrow or blood) attacks the recipient's body. GVHD occurs early after transplant (acute) and/or sometimes months after transplant (chronic). Both forms can be life threatening; chronic GVHD can be a lifelong disabling condition.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exist in tissues throughout the body. One place they are found is in the bone marrow and from here they can be obtained by needle aspiration, the same way bone marrow samples are obtained to test for leukemia. This study uses autologous MSCs obtained from the recipient with acute and/or chronic GVHD, which have a lower chance of being rejected. These MSCs may promote tolerance, helping the donor immune cells accept the recipient's body.\n\nThis trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly cultured autologous MSC grown in platelet lysate-containing medium will modulate donor T-cell immune responses and reduce GVHD in allo-HSCT recipients. As a phase I dose escalation trial of autologous MSC in patients with acute and chronic GVHD, the main aim is to evaluate the safety of this therapy and its effects on GVHD biomarkers and T-cell phenotype"

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. This will be done by starting at a low dose of MSCs and moving on to the next higher dose level provided there are no safety concerns. Researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

The possible postulation for this is possibly because when using autologous CD34+ cell infusion, the inflammatory milieu of the liver may not be conducive for sustained effects of the mobilized CD 34+ cells. MSC have immunomodulatory effect (ref) and may improve the liver environment making it more beneficial for the CD34+ cells to function and survive. In addition, MSC has ben shown to produce hepatocyte growth factor which is protective against liver injury and beneficial for liver regeneration (shown in above tables). However, it remains to be understood how MSCs promote liver stem stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes or expand the residual hepatocyte population. MSC can also directly inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, the main source of extracellular matrix via MSC derived IL 10 and TNF-\u03b1and may also induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis. Current lacunae in cell based therapy is based on the poor consensus and understanding on the best type of cells to be used, the ideal number of cells, the most appropriate route of administration and the need for repeat dosing . The concept that combination of autologous hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be more beneficial than infusing any one of them alone has been discussed in many scientific forums but there are no study till date to either see the safety as well as the efficacy of this proof of concept .\n\nWith this above background data, we propose a study design which will be a safety study for combination use of autologous CD34+ and MSC"

                              "Transplant rejection is one of the biggest limitations in renal transplant procedures, where the kidney can undergo an acute, late acute, or chronic transplant rejection. With the advancement in transplantation protocols, acute survival of renal transplants has improved, but long-term survival is still unsatisfactory, as most of the renal transplants develop chronic graft rejection. Unfortunately, there is little the investigators know when it comes to improving long-term survival of renal transplants. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. The purpose of this study is to find out whether MSC in combination with standard therapy of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) are more effective in preventing organ deterioration and maintaining kidney function."

Mesenchymal stem cells are able to produce growth factors that provide support to diseased nervous cells.\n\nIn this study mesenchymal stem cells will be harvested from the bone marrow, cultivated in a test tube so that they multiply and then infused into the arteries that supply blood to the brain in 20 patients suffering from a rare form of parkinsonism, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Each patient will undergo two infusions, one with the stem cells and one without, at an interval of 6 months. The sequence of the two infusions will be assigned randomly; patients and assessors will not know the sequence (double-blind). Patients will be followed-up for up to 1 year after the last infusion, with regular assessments to assess safety, efficacy on motor and cognitive functions, and effects on the brain by neuroimaging techniques.\n\nThe study has a preliminary phase with 5 patients all given stem cell therapy alone, designed to assess safety"

The patients are operated with phonomicrosurgical dissection of the scarred vocal folds, removal or scar tissue and injection of autologous mesenchymal stroma cells, aMSC (which were previously harvested from each patients\u00b4s bone marrow, purified, expanded and characterized according to standard procedure at the Center of Hematology and Regenerative Medicine Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge). 8 Patients is planned to be treated with a single injection of aMSC and 8 patients with injection of aMSC mixed with a carrier hyaluronan gel developed at Uppsala University Sweden and at the Karolinska Institute. The laryngeal status, vocal fold function, and voice function will be followed individually with an advanced battery of examinations performed before and up to 1 year postoperatively. Side effects and complications are noted and reported during surgery and following surgery at regular intervals during at least 1 year Since spring 2015 no new patients have been recruited and no treatments are given during 2016 or 2017.

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nNon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

The investigators compare the intraarticular injection of against the administration of two different doses of mesenchymal stem cells with hialuronic acid according to the following scheme:\n\nGroup A: 3 intra-articular injections of platelet rich plasma (PRGF\u00ae) separated by 7 days.\nGroup B: 3 intra-articular injections of platelet richa plasma (PRGF\u00ae) separated by 7 days and one with Mesenchimal stems cells. Intra-articular injection of 100 million autologous mesenchymal progenitor stem cells cultured ex - vivo (cell suspension sterile small volume (5-10 ml ) in a vehicle suitable for intraarticular injection ) followed by an intraarticular injection of platelet richa plasma (PRGF\u00ae). The treatment is completed with 2 more injection of platelet richa plasma (PRGF\u00ae) separeted by one week.\n\nIn addition the investigators assess the response to intra-articular infusion of CMM analyzing the following parameters:\n\nClinical assessment of pain and function (Baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months since treatment): VAS , WOMAC , KOOS , EuroQol, SF-16, Lequesne , WOMAC , KOOS.\nRadiographic (baseline and 12 months from treatment): Femorotibial space.\nRadiographic using MRI (baseline and 12 months from treatment): by assessing the number location of the lesions , cartilage thickness , signal intensity , subchondral bone alteration , volume and WORMS and dGEMRIC protocols."

These two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Universitario del R\u00edo Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. The investigators propose a phase I / II clinical trial with 10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Checks will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan."

Knee cartilage tissue has little regenerative ability With the developments in regenerative medicine, stem cells might also be used in knee OA. Recently, adipose tissue has been identified as means for autologous mesenchymal stem cells (aMAT) using non-enzymatic method. Lipogems\u00ae is FDA-approved closed-system and directly producing ready-to-use aMAT. Some observational studies showed its potential in knee chondropathy. With no clinical trial done as yet, the investigators will hereby study the comparative efficacy of corticosteroid (current practice) versus Lipogems\u00ae in patients with knee OA. The knee MRI changes, clinical and patient-based outcomes will compared between baseline and throughout till 6 months after treatment. This study aims to show the comparative efficacy of Lipogems\u00ae as compared to corticosteroid in knee OA patients and to demonstrate its cartilage regeneration potential, which will ultimately deter surgery."

Bone marrow (BM) contains several types of stem cells that can produce functional cells. This includes cells that could help the healing process of damaged neurologic tissue.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to see if the injection of these cells, obtained from your own bone marrow, is safe. A secondary objective is to evaluate if the treatment can provide functional improvements (neuromuscular control and sensation) in the affected areas."

However, there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients receive induction therapy and immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) infusion compared to saline-only infusion in reducing the immune suppression necessary to achieve optimal renal function in renal transplant recipients. All participants will receive routine care: basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids."

                              "The prevalence of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per 100,000 population. The estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year. Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will develop MSA.\n\nThere are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a means of administering therapeutic agents.\n\nThe subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus clinical criteria for MSA. There will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5 subjects each.\n\nGroup 1 will receives MSC-Adipose Autologous with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally.\n\nGroup 2 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x 50 million cells intratechally.\n\nGroup 3 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally and 2x10cc secretome MSC from Adipose Intravenously.\n\nClinical improvement will be evaluated using the UMSARS scale, PET-Scans, MRI, DaTScan, IGF-1, BDNF, Sympathetic skin respons (SSR), EMG, Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS), High definition-Optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), ERG, VEP, Log MAR chart, Ishihara test and side adverse effect on MSC.\n\nThis study is divided into six timeframes : Before an implantation, First Month after second implantation, Third month after secondary implantation, Sixth month after second implantation, Ninth month after second implantation and Twelve month after second implantation. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to assess clinical improvement within the subjects."

In the present study we compare a new transplantation site (intramuscular in the arm) to the golden standard (the liver) in patients undergoing kidney transplantation from the same donor. In half of the intramuscular transplanted patients, the islets will be mixed with mesenchymal stemcells from the recipient to, possibly, improve the immunological aspects of the transplantation."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function.- Hormone therapy is used to treat female hormone deficiency and results in a significant improvement, but long-term use increases cardiovascular disease or cancer risk. Other treatments do not give apparent results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and effective treatments to achieve the requirements of improving health in general and sexual health in particularly in women. AD-MSCs have been widely used as autologous and allogeneic stem cell sources to treat numerous disease recently, and they have been proven to be safe. The phase I trial showed that administration of autologous AD-MSCs at the dose of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kg patient bodyweight was safe for patients with sex hormone deficiency. The therapy introduced potential improvement in sexual and general quality of life indicating by the increased FSFI. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

We plan to include 100 patients who met exclusion criteria of rotator cuff and lateral epicondylosis (tennis elbow) respectively by MRT or ultrasonography. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups. Adipose mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue, cultured and then transplanted back to the tendon injury site by multiple point injection. 1*10^6 cells as an unit. Patients in the experiment group will be injected into an unit of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (1*10^6/10kg) while the control group received the same dose compound betamethasone injection. Follow up visit for all patients will occur at 1\uff0c3\uff0c6 and 12 months after the first injection. Clinical quantitative assessment will measure by the visual analogue scale(VAS). The secondary outcomes are the constant-murley score(CMS) and the rating scale of the American shoulder and elbow surgeons(ASES) and the disability of arm shoulder and hand(DASH). The objective evaluation methods is that the examination of MRI or ultrasound were accomplished before the first injection and at 6 and 12 months afterwards."

Other inclusion criteria are age 20 to 75 years and a serum total bilirubin of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/dL, or if the total bilirubin is <3.0 mg/dL, patients who are still deemed unsuitable as a candidate for general anesthesia. About 30 mL of autologous bone marrow was collected from the bilateral iliac crests under local anesthesia, heparin was added after collection. In addition, at the Center for Regenerative and Cell Therapy at Yamaguchi University Hospital, a nucleated cell fraction was prepared. Next, a cell suspension was prepared by adding culture medium, and this was inoculated into a culture flask. After subculturing for 3 weeks, the cells were infused through a peripheral vein. The primary endpoint is the incidence of adverse events up to 24 weeks after ABMSC infusion."

Over the past few years, stem cell research has expanded greatly as a tool for developing new therapies to treat incurable diseases. Stem cell therapy has been shown as promising in several animal ALS models and human clinical trials."

After signing a consent form, participants will be randomized into two treatment groups. Group-A (NA=10) will receive crestal placement of implants following a two-stage protocol in combination with a biocomplex comprising autologous alveolar bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities and seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with autologous fibrin glue. In Group-B (NB=10) implants are placed on the alveolar crest following a two-stage protocol and the manufacturer's guidelines. Intra-surgical clinical and radiographic assessments are performed at the time of implant placement (T0) and at the two-stage surgery (T1). Changes in mucosa thickness, width of keratinized tissues, marginal bone and bone thickness at the surgical site will be determined at T0-T1. Groups will be further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical site at T0 [thin mucosa (\u22642.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (>2.5mm) for Groups-AII/-BII]. A linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine changes in the dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two stage-implants placed either conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex."

After completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment those subjects who have at least one interdental osseous defect with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level of \u2265 6mm and an intrabony component of \u2265 3mm with no endodontic or furcation involvement are randomly allocated into one of the three treatment groups. Group A receives regenerative treatment using autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities and seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with fibrin glue; in Group B, a collagen fleece enriched with fibrin glue devoid of stem cells fills the osseous defect; Group C receives open flap debridement retaining the soft wall of the defect. Thereafter, subjects are followed for 12 months and are repeatedly assessed based on clinical, radiographic, immunological and microbiological parameters.\n\nIn a series of cases, tissue engineering in a similar manner to Group A will be applied to treat isolated periodontal interdental defects, in combination with the novel \"closed surgical technique\"."

Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires.\n\nMSC obtained from each patient's bone marrow will be isolated and expanded \"Ex-Vivo\" under GMP conditions at Xcelia-Divisi\u00f3n de Terapias avanzadas del Banc de Sang I Teixits. After 21 days, patients will be implanted a single-dose of approximately 40 millions of autologous MSC in the knee by articular injection, and followed up for 12 month. Articular cartilage changes will be determined by T2-weighted MRI (Cartigram) at 6 and 12 month. Clinical assessment will measure the pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS), the self-reported functional status by Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the quality of life by Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) at 3, 6 and 12 month.\n\nThe working hypothesis proposes that the expected regenerative articular cartilage effect of the MSC will be produced to a measurable degree by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires."

He was emergently transferred to Miami, FL for stabilization and treatment, where he was diagnosed with a C5 -C6 Grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6: 7mm, with flexion teardrop fracture of the anterior aspect of C6, as well as jumped facet on the right and perched facet on the left at C5-C6 with spinal canal stenosis with cord compression, as well as with aspiration and near drowning. He underwent ACDF (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion) of C5-C6 and reduction of jumped facets and was immediately started on a hypothermia protocol to reduce spinal cord edema. His hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia. He discharged to Texas via air ambulance for physical rehabilitation on August 23, 2017 with a diagnosis of ASIA B (American Spinal Injury Association) C-5 SCI (spinal cord injury)."

Liver failure inpatients caused by hepatitis B were recruited and received the same medical treatments, among whom some patients underwent single transplantation with autologous MMSCs and other patients with matched age, gender and biochemical indexes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), prothrombin time (PT) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) ] were in control group. A total of 120 ml bone marrow were obtained from patients, diluted and separated. Then MMSCs suspension were slowly transfused into the liver through the proper hepatic artery by interventional procedures. The levels of ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD score of patients in translation group were compared with those in control group. In 3 ~ 48 months of follow-up, differences in long-term outcomes such as incidence of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and mortality between two groups were compared."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studies clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing. The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.\n\nIn addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.\n\nMSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19 Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective.\n\nThe current Phase I/II study of adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal stem cells is conducted with the broad objective of establishing safety and efficacy."

Using the potential features of MSCs in the treatment of fibrosis may offer new insights into reconstruction the damaged tissues. The project intends to transplant autologous MSCs to ten peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra-filtration failure. It's going to study infusion effects in clinical, cellular and molecular levels.\n\nSo in this trial, we will evaluate the effects of this intervention after intravenous injection of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in 10 peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra filtration failure (UFF). Fifteen UFF patients are also considered as the control group. Then they will be followed 20, 45 and 90 days, and also 4 and 6 months after first injection."

                              "MSCs have been studied for the treatment of liver diseases as well as non-liver diseases. MSCs have been successful in treating conditions like acute steroid-resistant GVHD in hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients and also have shown to improve the MELD score in end-stage liver disease. There were no severe side effects observed in using autologous MSCs as a treatment option. The outcome of the studies done so far have been positive and it is encouraged to study the use of MSCs as cell therapy for treating liver diseases.\n\nThe estimated rate of cirrhosis in HBV patients in Singapore is about 1.6% per year, rate of hepatocellular carcinoma is about 0.8% per year overall and 3.0% per year in cirrhotic patients. Knowing that there are not many options currently available for Liver Cirrhosis patients and that they have a poor prognosis with an average life expectancy of < 12 months, this study uses autologous MSCs to treat Liver Cirrhosis patients in Singapore. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that autologous bone marrow is safe to be used in patients with liver cirrhosis as well as demonstrate that bone marrow MSC may improve liver function and prolong patient survival."

The potential of ASC to lead to a disease-modifying therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be assessed by MRI after 1 and 2 years.\n\nThis will be a phase IIb, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind study, comparing culture-expanded autologous ASC with placebo."

                              "Knee joint cartilage cells metabolize slowly, and it is difficult to repair themselves after injury. Any knee joint trauma or the progression of osteoarthritis may lead to the progression of cartilage or osteochondral defects. Compared with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), peripheral blood MSCs have better chondrogenic differentiation ability. At the same time, the mobilization of peripheral blood MSCs and the advancement of extraction technology also make it feasible to treat osteochondral damage by using peripheral blood MSCs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of surgical transplantation of autologous peripheral blood MSCs to repair knee joint \u2163-degree localized cartilage injury, and to explore a new treatment for osteochondral defects based on the foundation of the research group's previous research."

Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis (MCIC).\n\nStudy hypothesis: We start with the hypothesis that both treatments are equally effective.\n\nTrial Design: This is a prospective study. The participating patients will be divided into two groups, each group receiving either one of the treatment modalities. This study will not be randomised or blinded. Both procedures will be done at the Spire Alexandra Hospital by Professor A. A Shetty, who is one half of the team that devised both techniques.\n\nTrial Participants: All participants will be from patients attending Professor Shetty's clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital.\n\nPlanned Sample Size: 50 patients in each arm.\n\nFollow-up duration: The participating patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery by visits to the clinic and assessed clinically. The surgical outcomes will be measured by by IKDC, KOOS and Lysholm scores; cartilage growth will be measured by the MOCART score.\n\nPlanned Trial Period: Two to three years\n\nPrimary Objective: To establish superiority, if any, of either procedure over the other.\n\nPrimary Endpoint: At the end of the 2 year follow up for all participating patients."

The investigators' selected model of research is based on maximizing the efficiency of the approach by choosing an autologous pattern which preserves the genetic make-up of an individual that is vital in infertility conditions. Additionally the approach involves injecting a combination of different but purified cell types which all aid in the retrieval of spermatogenesis, and the generation of mature spermatozoa. Expected outcomes of this study are defined in general improvements in infertile patients in regards of testicular morphology, sexual function, semen quality, development of primary or secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, or mature spermatozoa in the testis, seminiferous tubules, or semen."

Investigators initiated the MESAMI program by the bicentric pilot phase and highlighted the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial injections of MSCs from bone marrow in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction, guide by the NOGA-XP system. The MESAMI program continues with the phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.The aim of this phase 2 study is to demonstrate a functional improvement, measuring peak VO2, at 3 months between the cell therapy group and the placebo group."

Mesenchymal stem cells are undifferentiated cells which can undergo self-renewal & differentiation into other cell types like muscle cells; thus can be used to regenerate the damaged sphincter muscles. In this study mesenchymal stem cells will be obtained from bone marrow from the patient, processed, & then re-injected periurethrally. Effectiveness will be compared to that of the surgical treatment (tension-free vaginal tape)."

                              "Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.\n\nTherefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new opportunities for development of the same.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue.14\n\nAs limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been undertaken to explore the tolerability & effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC in second treatment arm in IPF patients.\n\nAdipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective"

These are divided into three groups: congenital (from birth), developmental (from a childhood disease or injury that slows or damages the growth plates), and posttraumatic (from a fracture that leads to shortening of the bone ends). There are three ways to equalize the limb-length discrepancy: use a shoe lift, shorten the long leg, lengthen the short leg. Most patients do not like wearing a lift greater than 2 cm (3/4 in). For discrepancies greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm (2 in), shortening of the long leg can be considered, especially for tall persons. For growing children, this can be easily accomplished with a small, minimally invasive, uncomplicated procedure called epiphysiodesis.The investigators aim to evaluate if injection of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells can shorten the treatment period by acceleration of bone regeneration during distraction osteogenesis."

                              "Background: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a potent alkylating agent that targets several organs, especially lung tissue. SM exposure leads to serious changes in morphological structure of airway system, which is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary deficiency following exposure to SM. With extensive progress and achievements in tissue repair through stem cells therapy, consideration of lung tissue has been increased due to the high prevalence of pulmonary problems. Several factors such as selection of cell types, required conditions for growth and proliferation of stem cells, and the process of entering into the body to repair damaged lung tissue are considered as the most important problems in this issue. Accumulating studies, both in animals and human with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) support the hypothesis of therapeutic effects of these cells in various disorders. In this study investigators aimed to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of systemic MSC administration for treatment of chronic lung injuries in SM-exposed patients.\n\nMethods: Patients will receive 100 million MSC cells every two months for three injections within 6 months. After each injection, parameters including safety, pulmonary function testing (PFT), quality-of-life indicators, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), and expression of inflammation and oxidative stress genes will be evaluated."

                              "Early reperfusion strategies in tandem with remarkable advances in drugs and devices for treating myocardial infarction (MI) have contributed to a reduction in early mortality, but cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI."

                              "Cirrhosis is caused by sustained liver damage over several years either by alcohol, viral infection (Hepatitis B, C), a toxic substance (for eg. drugs, excess copper or iron in the liver), or by blockage of biliary system such that the liver undergoes progressive scarring that slowly replaces all of normal liver cells.(LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. For this condition of disease the liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available ,but due to lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nPresently stem cells are used to be a one of the treatment for the same. So our approach is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell in condition of liver cirrhosis ."

                              "Bone grafting is widely used in hospitals to repair injured, aged or diseased skeletal tissue. In Europe, about one million patients encounter a surgical bone reconstruction annually and the numbers are increasing due to our ageing population. Bone grafting intends to facilitate bone healing through osteogenesis (i.e. bone generation) at the site of damage, but this is only attained presently by including cells capable of forming bone into the augmentation.\n\nBone autograft is the safest and most effective grafting procedure, since it contains patient's own bone growing cells (to enhance osteogenesis) and proteins (to enhance osteoinduction), and it providing a scaffold for the new bone to grow into (osteoconduction). However, bone autograft is limited in quantity (about 20 cc) and its harvesting (e.g. from the iliac crest) represents an additional surgical intervention, with frequent consequent pain and complications.\n\nWe hypothesize that using autologous bone marrow cells expanded in GMP facility surgically implanted with synthetic bone substitutes contribute to the resolution of the health and socioeconomic complications of delayed union or non-union after diaphyseal and metaphyseal-diaphyseal fractures with safety and efficacy."

Based on extensive preclinical investigations, the technology of using freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells mixed with proteins seems safe and most effective for a one-step correction of cartilage defect and restoration of the osteochondral complex, because the same mixture can generate cartilage in the vasculature-free knee joint, and bone in the environment of bone defects."

Infusion of BMMNCs and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in combination might exert enhanced repairing effects. We hypothesized that infusion of these two classes of cells might provide multiple signals for regeneration and improve recovery from inflammation-induced lesion.

                              "Heart attacks are a leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. When a person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes, these treatments can not reverse the original damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of injecting MSCs into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who have had a heart attack and who are having heart surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)."

                              "Contour deformity of face causes both functional as well as aesthetic problems for the patient. Fat being an autologous tissue source is considered as an ideal soft-tissue filler because it is abundant, readily available, inexpensive, host compatible, and can be harvested easily and repeatedly. However absorption of grafted fat is a major problem resulting in lack of consistency of final clinical outcome. Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to enhance the viability of the grafted fat and the reliability of the final outcome of surgery. In the current study potential of mesenchymal stem cells will be studied by comparing two groups of patients requiring fat grafting for contour deformities of face. Control group will have fat graft with out enrichment with stem cells whereas experimental group will have their fat graft enriched with mesenchymal stem cells. Comparison will be made regarding viability of grafted fat in two groups."

                              "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease, mainly characterized by cutaneous and visceral fibrosis. Digital ulcer and sclerosing skin are commonly affected on hands, but the treatment for these manifestations are often ineffective.\n\nAdipose tissue contains stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is abundant multipotent stem cells, capable of tissue repair. A prior study (NCT01813279) has shown the safety and tolerance at 6 months of the subcutaneous injection of SVF in the fingers in SSc.\n\nThere are only few ways to manage SSc patients with skin lesion who already have treated with several medications (including vasodilators, PDE5 inhibitor, endothelin receptor antagonist) but some times their skin lesions are critical physically and emotionally.\n\nAutologous SVF injection could be one of the treatment options to treat skin lesion of SSc. Thus, the investigators study the efficacy and potential adverse event in Korean patients with SSc."

                              "Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. When a person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes, these treatments can not reverse the all damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs directly into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who have had a heart attack and who have chronic myocardial ischemia with heart failure."

The primary objective is to determine if the intravenous infusion of autologous BMMNC after severe TBI results in structural preservation of global gray matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) volume and integrity; as well as select regions of interest in the corpus callosum. THe secondary objectives are to determine if autologous BMMNC infusion improves functional and neurocognitive deficits in adults after TBI; reduces the neuroinflammatory response to TBI; evaluate spleen size and splenic blood flow over time using ultrasound and corresponding changes in inflammatory cytokines; and infusion related toxicity and long-term follow-up safety evaluations."

The technique is frequently used after radical or conservative mammary surgery, aiming to achieve better aesthetic results, reduce pain induced by both surgery and radiotherapy. The scientific community was widely involved in the debate regarding the use of mesenchymal/stem cells in a patient with high risk of tumor progression due to their elevated proliferative profile. This study aims to retrospectively evaluate the oncological safety in the use of lipofilling in patients who underwent oncological and reconstructive treatment in our Institute."

VSELs are able to regenerate the affected ovary. Stimulation was achieved by injection of mesenchymal stem cells that is supposed to secrete trophic factors.\n\nNumerous studies in mice have proved the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in resuming the ovarian function after chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency.\n\nAllogeneic BMT raised the moral conflict about the origin of the newly developed oocytes. Several small studies examined the use of autologous BMT both in animal and in human. The results of these studies were promising. Intravenous injection is simpler and less invasive than ovarian injection as the later involves the use of laparoscopy. However, intravenous injection has not tested until now."

                              "Despite being a miracle of modern medicine, solid organ transplant recipients are always at risk of rejection, and remain dependent on lifelong immunosuppression. Currently used immunosuppressive drugs suppress the potential of immune system and interfere with the metabolism of medications. Cellular therapies currently being investigated for this purpose require the use of ablative radiotherapy. The investigators are using a less toxic strategy by harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of the MSCs in the Kidney Transplant (KTx) recipients and studying immunomodulation mediated by these cells in the KTx patients.\n\nHypothesis MSCs interfere with signalling of Immune cells like T cells, B cells and Dendritic cells which leads to improve graft survival of renal transplant patients.\n\nAim To investigate effect of MSCs on immune cell repertoire in a donor specific mediated response.\n\nThe investigators aim to collect peripheral blood from 30 patients (10 patients for autologous cell infusion and 10 for allogeneic (donor derived cell infusion) at various time intervals following MSC therapy. 10 patients serve as controls on standard dose of drugs but without MSC infusion. This peripheral blood would be utilized for isolation of mononuclear cells and performing various immune assays on these cells in a donor specific response."

The trial is based in our own previous results with autologous MSC (ongoing NCT01183728 trial). We propose here a multicenter, phase I-II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment of osteoarthritis (degrees II and III and IV). The assay consists of two arms with 15 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given an intra-articular transplantation of allogenic MSC, expanded \"Ex Vivo\" with our GMP-compliant procedure (MSV, PEI No. 10-134, authorized by the Competent Authority; same as in NCT01183728). In the control arm a standard treatment with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid shall be given. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability, quality of life and quantitative changes in structure and composition of cartilage determined by T2-weighted MRI relaxation (Cartigram) for one year."

The trial is based in previous results with autologous MSC (Orozco et al., Transplantation 92: 822-828; 2011). Here we propose a phase I-II trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment DDD using MSV, a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant expanded bone marrow MSC (MSV, PEI Num. 10-134). The assay consists of two arms with 12 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given a single intra-discal transplantation of MSV (25 millions in 2 ml). Control patients will be infiltrated in the paravertebral muscles close to the lesion with 2 ml of 1% mepivacain. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability and quality of life as well as disc fluid content by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (T2-calibrated)."

Revascularization by either bypass surgery or endovascular recanalization is considered the first-choice treatment in patients with CLI.\n\nRevascularization is not always possible because patients with CLI often have severe comorbidities or because it is not technically feasible.\n\nOn the basis of their well-recognized regenerative and angiogenetic properties, cell therapy with autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) has been proposed and tested in different animal models and in some human pathological conditions characterized by peripheral ischemia and wound formation."

                              "Crohn's disease is an immunologically mediated inflammatory bowel disease with a reported incidence of 4.0-7.0, 7.1, and 1.34 per 100,000 persons in Europe, the U.S., and Korea, respectively. Uncontrolled chronic inflammation finally causes various complications in intestine such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, and anal fissures.\n\nThe incidence of perianal fistula was reported in 13%- 39% of patients with Crohn's disease. Medical treatment for Crohn's fistulae initially focused on surgical intervention accompanied by symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressants. The most serious problem after surgical intervention is the relatively high incidence of postoperative anal incontinence caused by sphincter injury during the procedure. Conversely, available pharmacological therapies for Crohn's fistulae based on biologic agents such as infliximab do not generally reach ideal goal of treatment (e.g., complete closure of the fistula). A high recurrence rate after treatment with infliximab has also been reported, even after long-term maintenance therapy, which suggests that infliximab monotherapy does not provide adequate healing.\n\nThe ACCENT II study demonstraded a complete fistula healing in 25% of patients. To reach a better clinical outcome, combination treatment with infliximab and surgical intervention is highly recommended for management of Crohn's fistulae. Nonetheless, even this strategy does not result in a satisfactory healing for many patients.\n\nThe ideal therapeutic goal of treatment is not only complete closure of the fistula without recurrence but also preservation of anal sphincter function. Unfortunately, currently available medical or surgical treatment is not likely to offer a cure for perianal fistulae and, as noted above, recurrence is frequently reported.\n\nTogether with active research in the field of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, autologous or allogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been studied for management of Crohn's disease and other disorders.\n\nOf particular relevance to this study, ASCs could be considered to be safe and efficacious therapeutic tools for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. Importantly, ASCs do not cause fecal incontinence after injection into the lesion site in Crohn's disease patients. A phase I dose-escalation clinical study with ASCs manufactured by Anterogen Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) demonstrated the safety and therapeutic potential of these cells for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. A phase II study demonstrated a good rate of cronh's related fistula closure using a ASCS injection.\n\nActually the best accepted treatment of Crohn related perianal fistula, is the surgical procedure in association whit medical therapy."

                              "Articular cartilage defects in the knee have a poor intrinsic healing capacity and may lead to functional disability and osteoarthritis. Cartilage cell therapy using autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy medicinal product. Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly and extensive two-stage procedure which is limited by the number of chondrocytes obtained by biopsy and the dedifferentiation resulting from the expansion phase. Therefore, there is a need for improvement. A new cartilage repair technique should aim at decreasing surgical trauma, lowering complexity, improving logistics and cost-effectiveness while retaining or improving clinical outcome. Direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes in vitro showed improvement of the chondrogenic phenotype of dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. In addition, preserving the pericellular matrix of chondrocytes improves cartilage formation. These chondrons (chondrocytes with their pericellular matrix) have shown improved cartilage formation when combined with allogeneic MSCs in extensive preclinical studies. The cells are mixed with fibrin cell carrier and applied to the cartilage lesion within one surgical procedure. This will reduce patient morbidity and improve patient care through immediate transplantation of a potent cell-based cartilage product. This is a phase I/II prospective monocenter study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the IMPACT for treatment of focal articular cartilage lesions of the knee."

                              "Recently there has been a growing interest in the role of subchondral bone in knee arthritis, both in its etiology and evolution and in its clinical significance. It has now been widely demonstrated that changes in the subchondral bone can develop both as a cause and as a consequence of joint degeneration and it is now accepted in the scientific community that the presence of these changes is of clinical importance, causing pain and an inflammatory state that can contribute to the evolution of arthrosis arthropathy. Recently the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow has been proposed for the treatment of gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently, treatments have been studied and proposed for the treatment of the bone-cartilage interface in knees affected by osteoarthrosis, using autologous bone marrow concentrate, with promising results."

                              "Vocal Folds scarring (whether congenitally or following phonosurgery) can result in a range of symptoms depending on severity and extent, such as hoarseness, breathy voice, increased effort to speak, and voice fatigue. The inability to phonate normally causes both physical and psychological disability, especially for professional communicators (teachers, tradesmen, singers, etc.). There are several therapies currently available but these are often disappointing, as the great complexity of vocal fold microstructure hinders the development of effective therapy. Thus, identification of innovative strategies able to improve vibrational mechanical properties of vocal folds remains an important clinical challenge.\n\nAutologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) is recognized as an easily accessible source of cells displaying angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. Recent experimental and clinical reports also supported the anti-fibrotic potential of ADVSF, mainly attributed to the mesenchymal stem/stromal cell subset.\n\nSafety in humans has already been confirmed in several studies, including our previous clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT0262246; EudraCT number: 2015-000238-31). The main objective of this phase I/II trial was to measure for the first time the safety and tolerability of autologous ADSVF local injections in patients with scarred vocal folds. No severe adverse events occurred: only some minor adverse events were reported. Moreover, Voice Handicap Index was improved in all patients with a mean improvement from baseline of 40.1/120 and seven patients were considered as responders, defined as an improvement \u2265 18 points.\n\nBased on these observations, we hypothesized that the injection of autologous ADSVF could reduce the process of fibrosis, improve vibration and then dysphonia and quality of life in patients with scarred vocal folds.\n\nIn the absence of a reference treatment, the effectiveness of the ADSVF will be compared to a placebo: the local injection of excipients solution.\n\nThis study will test efficacy of the autologous ADSVF to treat vocal folds scarring. It is a randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical trial conducted according to a 2-treatment parallel design, with medico-surgical and scientific collaboration.\n\nRecruitment and follow-up of patients will be done in 4 university hospitals by the respective ENT teams (Marseille, Toulouse, Nice and Montpellier): 36 patients will be recruited and treated on a 24 months period.\n\nAt inclusion, 36 patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into two groups: ADSVF group and placebo group. Adipose tissue removal, ADSVF production and injection of ADSVF or placebo will be done on the same day during a short hospital stay. Patients will be followed and evaluated at 1 and 6 months with self-evaluation (Voice Handicap Index and a 10 points scale), video-laryngo-stroboscopic examination, vocal assessment with perceptive, acoustic and aerodynamic parameters and evaluation of adverse events. At the end of this 6-month follow-up (primary endpoint), patients without improvement will be offered an injection of thawed and washed ADSVF. Patients will continue to be followed in open-label on the same endpoints."

                              "Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) which may cause acute life-threatening morbidity or chronic disabilities. Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating GVHD. Therefore, the investigator designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute or chronic GVHD."

                              "In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency, drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.\n\nThe study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial, involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24 months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI."

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as disease-modifying agents (DMDs).\n\nUnfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the deleterious immune reactions. According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS, an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune process, to protect axons and neurons from degeneration, and to enhance repair and facilitate remyelination.\n\nA specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown remarkable ability to modulate the immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs in people with MS."

                              "Formal study hypothesis:\n\nCranial reconstruction using mesenchymal stromal cells and resorbable biomaterials, will result in the patient producing their own bone to fill the void which will reduce the risk of infection and resorption, lead to a better cosmetic result and obviate any long term consequence of having a synthetic material in vivo.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThere are several reasons that parts of the skull may need to be removed:\n\nAfter trauma to relieve brain swelling\nDuring brain surgery (for brain cancer)\nAfter trauma where the bone is so badly fractured/fragmented it needs to be removed.\n\nIn all but the last case the bone flap is temporarily stored in a freezer and once the brain swelling has subsided it is reinserted. This procedure is called \"autologous cranioplasty\"; autologous, because it originally came from the patient and cranioplasty, referring to the repair. Although this is a straightforward procedure, there are a number of complications including infection and bone resorption that can occur.\n\nThis study:\n\nStromal cells have a proven ability to aid in bony healing. Furthermore stromal cells on a ceramic framework encased in a plastic scaffold have been shown in a small clinical trial to lead to healing of skull defects. In the present study, it is proposed to add stromal cells from a suitable donor to medical grade ceramic granules, place them in between specially moulded plastic scaffolds and insert the sandwich into the skull. Both the ceramic and plastic materials are medical grade and commonly used in reconstructive surgery, the ceramic for packing into bony defects due to trauma or removal of cancer and the polymer in bony reconstruction. Both materials are approved by the TGA. They are designed to dissolve away over time as the body's own blood vessels and cells populate the sandwich and create the patient's new bone. It has been proven that without the encouragement of the cells and temporary scaffold materials, a hole in the skull will not heal. Given the incidence of bone resorption/infection and metal plate infection using traditional methods, it would seem prudent to provide a construct that will allow controlled replacement with the patient's own bone, thus negating any adverse long-term complications with synthetic materials that remain for life."

Stem cell transplantation instead of conventional medical therapy or orthotopic liver transplantation will be a promising alternate approach to regenerate damaged hepatic mass. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are generally thought of as an autologous source of regenerative cells in previous studies.In this study, the safety and efficacy of menstrual blood-derived stem cells transplantation for patients with liver cirrhosis will be evaluated."

The diseases occurred after endogenous and exogenous stimuli (tuberculosis, tumor, surgery, tracheal intubation) causing damage to the airway mucosa, resulting in scar repair and irreversible loss of airway epithelium. Autologous adipose vascular fraction (stromal vascular fraction, SVF) is a mixture of cells obtained from adipose tissue through digestion and centrifugation, containing a variety of cell types, such as mesenchymal cells, endothelial progenitor cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, and macrophages. Previous studies have shown that SVF can achieve regeneration and wound healing through modulating the immune microenvironment, promoting angiogenesis, thereby promoting endogenous regeneration of the in situ adult stem cells. This project utilizes the tissue repair function of autologous SVF to treat benign airway stenosis and respiratory tract fistula. To clarify the efficacy and safety of autologous SVF in the treatment of airway injury."

Several studies have used autologous stem cells or adipose-derived stem cells to treat Crohn's disease and its associated complications, and have achieved good efficacy. Thus far, the use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat Crohn's disease has rarely been reported. In this study, UC-MSCs were used to treat patients with hormone-controlled Crohn's disease. We observed the disease control conditions, corticosteroid dosage changes, and treatment-related adverse reactions."

There is no currently codified treatment for this type of situation and no therapeutic antifibrotic has been effective. Cell therapy is a promising new approach.After a liposuction and removing of mature adipocytes (40 to 60%), the remaining cells called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) could be isolated. SVF consists of a heterogeneous cell population including multipotent stem cells similar to mesenchymal stem cells present in bone marrow. The investigators hypothesis is that the trophic and antifibrotic properties of SVF could benefit patients with vocal cords scarring responsible for dysphonia."

                              "Recently, the emergence of biotherapies has allowed the use of intra-articular injections of autologous plasma rich platelet (PRP). Their use is widespread since 2010 and is based on the demonstration that platelets-enriched plasma, by virtue of its growth factors concentration, stimulates in vitro and in vivo cartilage regeneration in preclinical models. Recent literature highlights that these autologous products are very well tolerated by humans. PRP, as an intra-articular injection therapy, seems to be an autologous biological medicine, innovative for cartilage injury reparation and showing good primary results for this indication.\n\nAdipose tissue contains stromal-vascular fraction (SVF), in which are located a large proportion of mesenchymal multipotent stem cells (Adipose-derived stem cells, ADSCs) able to differentiate into several cellular lines in vitro and in vivo, including cartilage cells.\n\nThe association of microfat and PRP is interesting in order to potentiate trophic and regenerative effects on damaged cartilage site. The combination of these two products, respectively rich in autologous multipotent stem cells and growth factors, aims to create an optimal environment for cartilage cells regeneration. Furthermore, microfat semi solid phase is playing the role of a nutritive support matrix which contains and limits the diffusion and resorption of PRP liquid while allowing progressive growth factors release on the injection site.\n\nThe hypothesis of this project is that standardized injection of an innovative treatment (microfat and autologous PRP) should allow delay the use of invasive surgical therapy in the treatment of wrist osteoarthritis. This minimally invasive treatment could provide a curative second line treatment in case of medical treatment failure."

                              "Several studies have documented that transplantation of bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) following acute myocardial infarction is associated with a reduction in infarct scar size and improvements in left ventricular function and perfusion. The available evidence in humans suggests that BMC transplantation is associated with improvements in physiologic and anatomic parameters in both acute myocardial infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease, above and beyond the conventional therapy. In particular, intracoronary application of BMC is proved to be safe and was associated with significant improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure.\n\nIn contrast to ischemic heart failure, the data on effects of BMC transplantation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are limited to pre-clinical studies. In a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy, intramyocardial delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal cells improved LVEF, possibly through induction of myogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as by inhibition of myocardial fibrosis, suggesting that the beneficial effects of stem cell transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy may primarily be related to their ability to supply large amounts of angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and mitogenic factors. Similarly, transplantation of cocultured mesenchymal stem cells and skeletal myoblasts was shown to improve LVEF in a murine model of Chagas disease.\n\nStudy Aim:\n\nTo define the clinical effects of BMC transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy in a pilot clinical study investigating the effects of intracoronary CD34+ cell transplantation on functional, structural, neurohormonal, and electrophysiologic parameters in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy."

                              "Non-traumatic osteonecrosis is a painful disorder of the hip characterized by a necrosis of the osteomedullary tissue, which leads to subchondral bone collapse and joint destruction. Core decompression is currently the treatment of choice for early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. This method consists in decompressing the rigid intra-osseous chamber to promote revascularization, thus halting progression of the disease and stimulating repair. Still this treatment remains highly controversial, since the success rates of the first studies have not been repeated.\n\nThe exact pathology mechanisms involved in osteonecrosis have not yet be fully elucidated. Several hypotheses have been evoked, including fat embolism, trabecular bone microfractures, microvascular tamponade and, more recently, impaired bone and/or mesenchymal cells recruitment.\n\nThree studies have indicated the potential clinical benefits of cell-based approaches for the treatment of osteonecrosis (Hernigou 1997, Hernigou & Beaujean 2002, Gangji et al. 2004). This is on the basis of these observations that a proprietary population of autologous osteoblastic cells (PREOB\u00ae) has been developed.\n\nThis Phase 3 study aims at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of PREOB\u00ae in the treatment of early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. More specifically, the purpose of the study is to demonstrate that core decompression/PREOB\u00ae implantation into the necrotic lesion is superior to core decompression/placebo implantation in relieving hip symptoms and halting (or reverting) radiological progression of the disease."

                              "Vitiligo is a complex disease causing a selective, often progressive, loss of functioning melanocytes from epidermal basal layer resulting in white patches on the skin and occasionally mucosae. Worldwide prevalence of vitiligo is around 1% whereas in India it is around 3-4% ranging from 0.46% to 8.8%.\n\nEtiopathogenesis of vitiligo is multifactorial consisting of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Environmental and genetic factors act in concert to destroy melanocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in vitiligo pathology,but the autoimmune pathogenesis has been proposed as one of the main causes of vitiligo.\n\nSurgical methods, mainly transplantation of non cultured epidermal cell suspension are effective treatment for stable vitiligo. Transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension and non-cultured dermal cell suspension in combination (a mode of cellular grafting technique) is a novel surgical method for the treatment of vitiligo. Cytotoxic CD8+ ( cluster of differentiation 8+) cells in vitiligo perilesions may dictate the fate of transplantation, and strategies against CD8+ T cell activation might be beneficial for patients undergoing melanocyte transplantation. Mesenchymal cells could inhibit T cell proliferation and induce T cell apoptosis. Bartsch first identified and characterized dermal mesenchymal cells (DMCs). They have a multi-lineage differentiation potential into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes.Vitiligo patients' autologous melanocytes transplantation efficiency may be predicted by perilesional skin-homing CD8+ T cell activities, and the immunoregulatory DMCs might be used as auxiliary agent to improve the efficacy.\n\nThis pilot study is planned to compare transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension v/s its combination with non-cultured dermal cell suspension as a novel method in vitiligo surgery in stability of vitiligo with regards to extent of repigmentation, color matching of repigmented area, patient satisfaction and adverse events if any. This is the first study using transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension and non-cultured dermal cell suspension in combination as a new modality in vitiligo surgery."

Because they make growth factors, these cells can help re-grow tissue and encourage repair of damaged tissue. Tests on damaged heart muscle suggest that injecting these cells directly into damaged heart muscle can improve heart function. Researchers want to give stem cells to people who are having open heart surgery to see if they can help to repair heart muscle damage.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow stromal stem cell injections given during heart surgery to treat heart muscle damage.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have open heart surgery for heart artery or vein blockages.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.\nParticipants will have bone marrow taken from both hip bones about 3 weeks before the heart surgery.\nDuring the surgery, the stromal stem cells collected from the bone marrow will be given into the damaged portion of the heart muscle. The rest of the heart surgery will be performed according to standard procedures.\nAfter the surgery, participants will be monitored for complications from the stromal stem cells.\nParticipants will have heart function tests to see if the stromal stem cell treatments were effective...."

It has been shown (mainly for BM-MSC) that MSC can down-regulate T cells activation. This characteristic of BM derived MSC already has clinical implications and shows their potent effectiveness both in prophylaxis and treatment of resistant GvHD. Ongoing clinical trials of use bone marrow MSC for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD are successfully run on and some bone marrow donor registries included BM-MSC as a material for donation. According to our preclinical studies MSC from cells from marrow, placenta, umbilical cord vessels demonstrate similar pronounced immunosuppressive effect both with autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes. Our preliminary clinical experience shows that BM-MSC is an effective tool for treatment of steroid resistant GVHD. Present study aimed to demonstrate if human UC-MSC has in vivo immunosuppressive effect and can be used for GVHD treatment"

Current treatment has various limitations so that alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, with the ultimate goal of healing damaged articular cartilage are needed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy has shown promising results. However, MSCs are limited by complex regulatory issues. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue through mild mechanical force. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems."

Core decompression is currently the treatment of choice for early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. This method consists in decompressing the rigid intra-osseous chamber to promote revascularization, thus halting progression of the disease and stimulating repair. Still this treatment remains highly controversial, since the success rates of the first studies have not been repeated.\n\nThe exact pathology mechanisms involved in osteonecrosis have not yet be fully elucidated. Several hypotheses have been evoked, including fat embolism, trabecular bone microfractures, microvascular tamponade and, more recently, impaired bone and/or mesenchymal cells recruitment.\n\nThree studies have indicated the potential clinical benefits of cell-based approaches for the treatment of osteonecrosis (Hernigou 1997, Hernigou & Beaujean 2002, Gangji et al. 2004). This is on the basis of these observations that a proprietary population of autologous osteoblastic cells (PREOB\u00ae) has been developed.\n\nThis Phase 2B study aims at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of PREOB\u00ae in the treatment of early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the implantation of the investigational product PREOB\u00ae (human autologous bone marrow-derived osteoblastic cells) in comparison to bone marrow concentrate (BMC) when implanted at the osteonecrotic lesion of the femoral head, with a follow-up period of up to 5 years."

                              "Failure rates of up to 30% are reported after proximal humeral fractures despite angular-stable devices. This may devastate not only the functional outcome but also the independence of elderly patients.\n\nTo increase bone mineral density and thereby holding-strength augmentation is an option. Autologous bone-graft, as current gold-standard, though is questionable in osteoporosis since osteoprogenitors are dysfunctional and the harvesting-morbidity considerable. Adipose tissue seems an alternative cell-source even in presence of osteoporosis.\n\nStromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from lipoaspirates display osteogenic and vasculogenic potential and can be harvested in high numbers. Expansion associated with costly good-manufacturers-practice facilities is avoidable, so are repeated interventions. These cells have been successfully used to generate osteogenic composite grafts with intrinsic vascularity in preclinical models.\n\nFor translation into clinical practice after a 20 patient external pilot a prospective randomized controlled trial with 270 patients is planned. For the trial lipoaspiration precedes open reduction and internal fixation in individuals over 60 years presenting with a proximal humeral fracture after low-energy trauma. Cells are isolated (Cellution\u00ae800/CRS) and wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules after embedding in a fibrin-gel for augmentation of the typical bone-void. Clinical/radiological follow-up is at 6 and 12 weeks for immediate complications and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Functional assessment is performed after 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months using the Quick-Dash- and Constant-Score.\n\nThe primary outcome is a reduction in secondary dislocation by 50% during the first postoperative year. Secondary dislocation is diagnosed on plain radiographs by an independent board certified radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal imaging if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\nMore than 20\u00b0 varus collapse of the humeral head fragment in relation to the humeral shaft\nScrew penetration through the humeral head"

                              "A new strategy for treatment of late radiation damage is to develop methods aimed at stimulating the regenerative capabilities of irradiated tissues. Since the main pathogenetic mechanism of the development of late radiation damage is the death or damage of the replicative mechanism of stromal cells (SC), a justified approach can be considered as transplantation of intact SC. Currently, there is convincing evidence in the scientific literature that the injection of intact autologous SCs into the zone of fibrosis surrounding the chronic radiation ulcer leads to the healing of a wound defect.\n\nAn Initiative Clinical Trial. Introduction of autologous regenerative cells of adipose tissue for the treatment of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula. It is assumed that patients will be included in the project within 12 months; the monitoring of each patient will last for 6 months; the total duration of the clinical part of the study will be 18 months; The total duration of the clinical trial including the preparatory phase and the writing of the report is about 24 months. It is assumed that at least 16 patients aged 20 to 75 years who have verified diagnosis of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula will participate in this pilot project. The aims of the clinical trial are to preliminarily assess the safety, effectiveness and quality of life of patients after introducing autologous regenerative cells of adipose tissue for the treatment of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula."

As a novel technique, stem cell transplantation provides a new option for patients with DPN. In 2012, Wuhan Central Hospital, took the lead in carrying out clinical research on the treatment of DPN with autologous bone marrow stem cells in China, and patients were significantly relieved. Based on this research, our clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN."

The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. Particularly, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) has been demonstrated to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the investigators propose a hypothesis that umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can also improve the disease conditions of LC patients, particularly reducing the decompensated conditions in these patients."

                              "The present investigation will be a Phase II, single center, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose escalation, infusion modality (intracoronary vs transendocardial injection using the Cordis Biosense NOGASTAR TM Mapping Catheter with the Biosense MYOSTAR TM left ventricular injection catheter) transplantation of an autologous (your own stem cells) combination of bone marrow-derived stem cells into myocardium for the treatment of severe coronary ischemia.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to determine if the infusion of a combination of stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same patient will contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in patients with symptomatic severe coronary ischemia(CI).\n\nIn this trial we will determine whether the combination stem cell treatment is safe, feasible and results in the development of mature stable and/or collateral vessels and improvement of cardiac function.\n\nCoronary Ischemia (CI) is intractable angina due to severe coronary artery disease which can seriously decrease blood flow to the heart.\n\nCI needs a comprehensive treatment since the condition will not improve on its own. The overall goal of the treatment is to increase blood flow to the heart and improve symptoms of angina.\n\nThe study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and unable to provide appropriate blood supply to the heart.\n\nPatients eligible to participate in this study are those suffering from severe blockages of the vessels of the heart and are not candidates for percutaneous revascularization or surgical procedures."

The cartilage has no intrinsic ability to repair resulting at long term in function loss in the joints. Currently available treatments are not satisfactory in the long term, the use of mesenchymal stem cells appears to be promising due to their ability to multipotency and immunomodulation properties. This project aims to determine the most appropriate source for regenerative medicine of cartilage stem cells from tissue taken during arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis. These cells will be tested for different chondrogenic markers. The success of this project will consider the implementation of a strategy for regenerative medicine in bone and joint diseases."
