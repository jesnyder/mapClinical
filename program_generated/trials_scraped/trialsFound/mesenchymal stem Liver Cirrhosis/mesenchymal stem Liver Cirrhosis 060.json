                              "Cirrhosis is caused by sustained liver damage over several years either by alcohol, viral infection (Hepatitis B, C), a toxic substance (for eg. drugs, excess copper or iron in the liver), or by blockage of biliary system such that the liver undergoes progressive scarring that slowly replaces all of normal liver cells.(LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. For this condition of disease the liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available ,but due to lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nPresently stem cells are used to be a one of the treatment for the same. So our approach is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell in condition of liver cirrhosis ."

No study was done in humans with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic effect of BM-MSCs in alcoholic cirrhosis as Phase II clinical study.\n\nMethods: Eleven alcoholic cirrhosis patients (M:F = 10:1) with Child-Pugh's class B and maintenance of alcohol abstinence at least 2 months were enrolled. At baseline, all patients received liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and serologic tests. BM-MSCs were isolated from each patient's BM and amplified for one month and injected two times at 4, 8week through Rt. hepatic artery. 5x106cells/mL of BM-MSCs were injected in each session. Follow up biopsy, HVPG and relative expression of tissue transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-\u03b21), \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen-1 by real time RT PCR were measured after 12weeks from 2nd BM-MSC injection. The primary outcome was improvement in patients' histology Aim :\n\nThe researchers aimed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of new therapy with bone marrow derived autologous mesenchymal stem cell for hepatic failure caused by alcoholic liver cirrhosis."

                              "Biliary atresia (BA) is the most frequent cause of chronic cholestasis in neonates, accounting for at least 50% of pediatric liver transplantation. BA incidence is estimated to range from 1:5000 to 1:19000 live births. All patients will die due to complications of liver cirrhosis if the operation is not performed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been found as a promising therapy for liver cirrhosis in adults. Bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation was also performed successfully for children with BA. Compared to MSC isolation from bone marrow, isolating MSCs from umbilical cord (UC) tissue is a less invasive procedure.\n\nFurthermore, UC-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for liver cirrhosis in adults and different pediatric diseases, including liver cirrhosis due to primary biliary cirrhosis. The investigators will compare the outcomes of 17 Kasai operated BA patients who receive UC-MSC transplantation to 17 BA patients who only undergo Kasai operation. Two transplantations of UC - MSCs will be performed via the hepatic artery: the first transplant will be performed at baseline, and the second one will be performed 6 months later with a dosage of 1 million MSCs per kg of body weight. The frequency and severity of the adverse events or serious adverse events associated with UC-MSC injection at 72 hours post-injection will be used to assess the safety. The efficacy of the therapy will be measured using Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score, liver function, and liver biopsy. This study would open a novel cell therapy to improve outcomes of patients with BA."

An estimated 7.18% of the Chinese (about 93 million) is infected with hepatitis B, and most of the HBV- related hepatitis can developed into liver cirrhosis.\n\nLiver transplantation is the only available life saving treatment for patients with end stage liver disease. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess plasticity and have the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte; Thus, MSCs hold great hope for therapeutic applications. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) exhibit a more beneficial immunogenic profile and greater overall immunosuppressive potential than aged bone marrow-derived MSCs. Like MSCs derived from bone marrow, hUC-MSCs can also be used to treat rat liver fibrosis and improve glucose homeostasis in rats with liver cirrhosis. In this study, the patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis will undergo administration of hUC-MSCs via hepatic artery to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSC treatment for these patients."

The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT) and albumin (ALB) were examined at pre-transplantation, and 3 days to 2 years post-transplantation. Child-Pugh scores and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial in 50 patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

However, the critical shortage of donor organs, high cost, and the problem of immune rejection limit its clinical application, and even some patients on the waiting list will never survive to receive a matched liver. Stem cell transplantation instead of conventional medical therapy or orthotopic liver transplantation will be a promising alternate approach to regenerate damaged hepatic mass. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are generally thought of as an autologous source of regenerative cells in previous studies.In this study, the safety and efficacy of menstrual blood-derived stem cells transplantation for patients with liver cirrhosis will be evaluated."

                              "MSCs have been studied for the treatment of liver diseases as well as non-liver diseases. MSCs have been successful in treating conditions like acute steroid-resistant GVHD in hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients and also have shown to improve the MELD score in end-stage liver disease. There were no severe side effects observed in using autologous MSCs as a treatment option. The outcome of the studies done so far have been positive and it is encouraged to study the use of MSCs as cell therapy for treating liver diseases.\n\nThe estimated rate of cirrhosis in HBV patients in Singapore is about 1.6% per year, rate of hepatocellular carcinoma is about 0.8% per year overall and 3.0% per year in cirrhotic patients. Knowing that there are not many options currently available for Liver Cirrhosis patients and that they have a poor prognosis with an average life expectancy of < 12 months, this study uses autologous MSCs to treat Liver Cirrhosis patients in Singapore. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that autologous bone marrow is safe to be used in patients with liver cirrhosis as well as demonstrate that bone marrow MSC may improve liver function and prolong patient survival."

                              "Though the results of autologous CD34+ cell infusion and MSC in independent studies have shown promise, yet they are yet to reach the desired long term outcome. The possible postulation for this is possibly because when using autologous CD34+ cell infusion, the inflammatory milieu of the liver may not be conducive for sustained effects of the mobilized CD 34+ cells. MSC have immunomodulatory effect (ref) and may improve the liver environment making it more beneficial for the CD34+ cells to function and survive. In addition, MSC has ben shown to produce hepatocyte growth factor which is protective against liver injury and beneficial for liver regeneration (shown in above tables). However, it remains to be understood how MSCs promote liver stem stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes or expand the residual hepatocyte population. MSC can also directly inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, the main source of extracellular matrix via MSC derived IL 10 and TNF-\u03b1and may also induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis. Current lacunae in cell based therapy is based on the poor consensus and understanding on the best type of cells to be used, the ideal number of cells, the most appropriate route of administration and the need for repeat dosing . The concept that combination of autologous hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be more beneficial than infusing any one of them alone has been discussed in many scientific forums but there are no study till date to either see the safety as well as the efficacy of this proof of concept .\n\nWith this above background data, we propose a study design which will be a safety study for combination use of autologous CD34+ and MSC"

                              "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.\n\nIn this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis, ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies."

Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. Reversing or delaying the process of cirrhosis and reducing the development of compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is one of the effective methods for liver disease treatment. MSCs are mainly derived from bone marrow, but bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have some shortcomings, such as cumbersome sampling, and the proliferation and differentiation ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells decrease obviously with the age of donors, which is not conducive to cell therapy. Umbilical cord has many advantages, such as wide source, convenient collection, small immune rejection, and small ethical controversy, which makes it a hot spot in stem cell research and has a wider prospect in cell therapy. This clinical study will explore the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B virus-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis."

                              "Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. Particularly, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) has been demonstrated to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the investigators propose a hypothesis that umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can also improve the disease conditions of LC patients, particularly reducing the decompensated conditions in these patients."

About 1/3 of the patients do not respond to UDCA, which is defined as refractory PBC. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been reported to improve the outcomes of PBC patients. Randomization controlled studies are needed to confirm the long term effect of MSC treatment for refractory PBC. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in PBC patients that do not respond to UDCA treatment. This study is an double-blind multicenter randomized and placebo-controlled study. Patients with with refractory PBC will be randomly assigned to receive MSC treatment plus UDCA or UDCA alone (control). Three times of MSC infusion (0.1-1x10E6 cells/kg body weight) via peripheral vein will be given to the experimental group (once in 4 weeks). The primary outcome is absolute change in alkaline phosphatase. Secondary outcomes are changes of other liver function indices such as ALT TBIL AST GGT, improve of symptoms and liver histology."

                              "Cirrhosis of the liver is a common clinical chronic progressive liver disease, which is a diffuse liver lesion caused by one or more causes over a long period of time or repeatedly. Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Besides, regulatory T cells(Tregs) had been proved as an immune regualtory T cell subsets, which could reduce immune cell activation and reduce liver injury severity. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

                              "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease that causes substantial loss of intrahepatic bile ducts, ultimately resulting in cholestasis, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Histologically, the disease is characterized by chronic portal inflammation with infiltration, destruction and loss of the epithelial cells in the small-sized and medium-sized bile ducts. Currently, Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13-15mg/kg/day is recommended as therapeutic drugs for PBC by AASLD and is approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with UDCA may delay disease progression and prolong survival free of liver transplantation. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both. UC-MSC has been application for the treatment of several severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for PBC patients will be evaluated."

Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment for that. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organs. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. In the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented. We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of healthy volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes, and the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."

                              "The immune system of a patient can attack the liver or the kidney received from a donor (organ rejection). This can be prevented by treating these patients long-life with immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs lead to numerous side effects and fail to prevent the rejection occurring months later after the transplantation (chronic rejection). Recently, it has been shown that a particular type of cells present in the bone marrow, namely Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), when injected to a patient, suppress its immune system and increase success rates of blood cells transplantation. This outcome opens doors to investigate the potential of these cells to provide a valuable tool for improving solid organ transplantation without the need of high concentration of immunosuppressive drugs. The present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of MSC administration after liver or kidney transplantation."
