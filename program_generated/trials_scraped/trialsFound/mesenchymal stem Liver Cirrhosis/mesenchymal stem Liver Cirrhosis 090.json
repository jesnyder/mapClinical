                              "Liver cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands and causes by many forms of liver diseases and conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. Liver cirrhosis has become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality with over one million people died due to cirrhosis in 2010 worldwide. Currently, the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. However, the shortage in donor organ availability and the side-effect associated with long-term immunosuppression after transplant requires the development of new alternative therapies for liver cirrhosis. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) as well as umbilical cord-derive mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. In Vietnam, however, there are no clinical trials to date that investigate the potential of UC-MSCs for liver cirrhosis management. This is a phase I, open label, single arm trial using UC-MSCs to treat patients with liver cirrhosis that includes 20 patients. The primary outcome measure will be change in MELD score at 3, 6, and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation from baseline. The safety is assessed by frequency and severity of the adverse event or serious adverse event associated with stem cell injection. This study could reconfirm the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis and would open a novel cell therapy for the treatment of adult liver cirrhosis"

                              "In this study, investigators aimed to transplant autologous, adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells to the patients with liver cirrhosis. Investigators also aimed to assess liver tissue regeneration, downgrade of clinical findings and antiviral efficacy. Finally investigators aimed to establish an alternative treatment modality to liver transplantation.\n\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) which can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important health problem especially in western countries. In 5% - 25 of patients with chronic HCV hepatitis who are nonresponders to current medical treatment, liver cirrhosis develops. Approximately 1/3 of patients with liver cirrhosis become decompensate in 10 years. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C, However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Some very recent studies emphasize the antiviral effects of MSCs. The reasons for choosing this study title is; no available medical treatment for the non-responder cirrhotic patients, shortage of organ donors, patients rapidly progressing to transplantation candidates, and patients dying while they are in waiting lists and finally hopeful data regarding MSC applications. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies.\n\nIn this study autologous adipose tissue derived MSCs will be transplanted to patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C. After invitro expansion, patients will receive 1 million cells per kg. via peripheral vein every week for 3 times. Also via hepatic artery, 3 million cells per kg will be infused for 3 times in every 2 weeks. With this protocol, investigators aimed to increase liver regeneration, decrease in liver fibrosis, increase the waiting time of patients in transplantation lists and finally to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by pathology examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations."

                              "Liver cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by the formation and accumulation of an extracellular matrix, which leads to the progressive distortion of the hepatic architecture. In China, the most important cause of liver cirrhosis is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver cirrhosis usually progresses irreversibly into advanced stage, such as a decompensated stage which is characterized by a series of clinical manifestations, including ascites, variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy with high mortality. Liver transplantation is the only option that can improve the survival of these decompensated liver cirrhosis patients; however, this procedure is associated with several limitations, such as the severe shortage of donor livers, long waiting lists, multiple complications, and high cost. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nAnimal models have shown that bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) can ameliorate liver fibrosis and reverse fulminant hepatic failure. In clinical, autologous BM-MSC have significantly improved liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. A recent research also found that autologous BM-MSC therapy safely improved histological fibrosis and liver function in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Allogeneic MSC therapy, such as umbilical cord-derived MSC (UC-MSC), have shown to be safe and beneficial for the patients with liver cirrhosis caused by autoimmune diseases. Our previous studies showed that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients and increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients. However, the single-center clinical study, the relative small size of the patient cohorts, absence of evaluation on long-term efficacy prevent firm conclusions being made with regard to the safety and efficacy of this treatment in liver diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how UC-MSC can improve the liver function, and the incidence of serious complications in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a multi-center clinical study."

After the catheter placement confirmed by angiography, umbilical cord MSCs will be infused slowly in 20-30 minutes. Umbilical cord MSCs will be infused intravenously slowly in 30-60 minutes in the intravenous infusion group. The control group will receive conserved therapy. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), prealbumin(PA)and albumin (ALB) will be examined at re-transplantation, and 3 days to 2 years post-transplantation. The efficacy of umbilical cord MSCs transfusion will be investigated. The efficacy of different interventional therapies will also be compared."

Novel treatment is urgently needed for patients who have an incomplete response to UDCA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent a promising tool for cell-based therapies of autoimmune diseases.

Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo controlled trial. After assignment of the written informed consent, thirty six patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be enrolled, and will be randomized by block randomization into treatment or placebo arm. All the enrolled patients will be in the waiting list of liver transplantation. In the treatment arm bone marrow of the patients will be aspirated, and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells will be cultured, and then will be infused through a peripheral vein. Also, the corresponding placebo will be infused for the placebo group. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after performing the procedure."

                              "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Ukraine. This will be a Phase I study with the main emphasis on the safety and efficiency profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."

Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis, However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation, donor shortage, long waiting list, high cost, risk of rejection, operative complications and complications related to immunosuppressive drugs.\n\n\"stem cells\" are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types and can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. In recent years, advances in stem cell biology, have made the prospect of tissue regeneration a potential clinical reality, and several studies have shown the great promise that stem cells hold for therapy. mesenchymal stem cell based therapy has shown as promising tool in cirrhotic conditions as this type of cells have the ability to differentiate to different cell types including hepatocytes A series of studies have been performed to assess the application of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to promote liver regeneration and to alleviate cirrhosis. Some animal-based studies showed that stem cell transplantation could ameliorate liver fibrosis and improve liver functions followed by several clinical trials on human, in patients with advanced liver diseases, these studies demonstrated that stem cell transplantation could significantly reverse hepatic failure with only limited side effects. However, the effectiveness of this therapy in recent clinical trials is still conflicting and need further evaluation."

                              "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and peripheral CD34 positive cells. Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Singapore. This will be a Phase I/II study with the main emphasis on the safety profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."

                              "There are about 1.7 billion people with different types of chronic liver diseases in the world, of which about 240 million are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and about 15%-40% of chronic hepatitis B can develop into liver cirrhosis and die of liver hardness every year There are hundreds of thousands of patients. There are about 90 million hepatitis B carriers in China, including about 20 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Every year, about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated liver cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. From the progression of liver fibrosis to the decompensation of liver cirrhosis, liver failure often occurs. Statistics show that slow increase The 28-day mortality rate of patients with acute liver failure of grade 1, 2 and 3 is as high as 22%, 32% and 77%. The 90-day mortality rate was 41%, 73%, 95%. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the most effective means to treat decompensated liver failure due to liver cirrhosis, However, the shortage of donor liver, immune rejection and high cost have become treatment obstacles. Application of artificial liver support system for blood flow Plasma replacement can remove toxic substances from blood, but it can't supplement albumin and coagulation factors, and it is important to whether reducing the mortality rate is still controversial. Therefore, it reverses or delays the process of liver cirrhosis and reduces the compensatory stage of liver cirrhosis It is an important link in the treatment of liver diseases that the patients develop into decompensated stage The curative effect of medical treatment on hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory period) is very limited; Liver transplantation is difficult to popularize in clinical application due to the lack of donors and high cost. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are derived from mesoderm in early development, is a high degree of self-renewal ability, Pluripotent stem cells with high proliferation ability and multidirectional differentiation potential widely exist in bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, and other tissues. They can be cultured and expanded in vitro, and can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, cartilage tissues, nerve cells, hepatocytes and so on under the control of specific conditions, which has great application value in cell therapy and tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory stage). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group, with 10 cases in each group, a total of 20 cases. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, namely, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with stem cells based on conventional medical treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of patients were observed in detail within 24 weeks after treatment, and the long-term effect of stem cell therapy was observed after 96 weeks of treatment."

                              "Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. BM-MSC has also been used to treat human liver diseases such as liver failure and liver cirrhosis. In a phase 1 study, autologous BM-MSC transplantation has potential to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can improve the longer term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well BM-MSC is tolerated and its safety in LC patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times UC-MSC treatment at 4-week intervals.\n\nArm B: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times saline infusions at 4-week intervals.\n\nUC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are infused intravenously. After cell therapy, patients are followed up for 75 months. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin(PA), the rountin blood test are detected at week 12, 24, 48 timepoints. Clinical symptoms as well as complication were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Cirrhosis of the liver is a common clinical chronic progressive liver disease, which is a diffuse liver lesion caused by one or more causes over a long period of time or repeatedly. Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. Decompensated liver cirrhosis is mainly manifested by liver function damage and portal hypertension, with multiple system involvement. Complications such as upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, secondary infection, hypersplenism, ascites, and carcinogenesis often occur in the late stage. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and Tregs transplantation had been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

Patients were recruited into three different dose groups, and 12 subjects were enrolled in each group. The subjects of each group will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, and 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg respectively. According to the principle of dose escalation, subjects preset to low-dose will receive the administration first. Each group will receive only one corresponding dose for safety and tolerability check. The subjects will be observed for 21 days after the initial dose due to limited proliferation or differentiation potential and relatively low immunogenicity of mesenchymal stem cell products. The safety measures will be discussed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether subjects who have received a single dose will proceed with subsequent injections. Once all subjects in the lower-dose group have completed the initial administration and observed for 21 days. The DSMB will decided whether to proceed with the next-dose group. All subjects will receive routine drug treatment during the study. Primary endpoint: incidence and severity of cell therapy related adverse events from the beginning of treatment to the end of the follow-up. Secondary end point of the study includes: the change in Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of the subjects from baseline, at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; the overall survival rate at the 12th month after the last administration; Changes in liver function compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; changes of child Pugh score compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; and the change of Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) score from baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration."

                              "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive cholestatic disease associated with the development of cirrhosis and liver failure that may justify liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only drug approved specifically for the treatment of PBC. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into biliary epithelial cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in PBC patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus UDCA. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus UDCA. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 4,8,12,24,36 and 48. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase(ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time(PT), albumin(ALB), prealbumin(PA), are detected at these time points. Mayo risk score, portal hypertension, Liver histology, MELD score and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Investigators plan to recruit 24 voluntary patients of decompensate liver cirrhosis with HBV, dividing them into 3 group\uff1a1) low-dose group: 100mL with 2.5\u00d710^7 cells\uff1b2) medium-dose group: 100mL with 5.0\u00d710^7 cells\uff1b3) high-dose group: 100mL with 1.0\u00d710^8 cells. Each group contains 8 patients. Investigators treat the participants with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells via venous transfusion. First investigators arrange a whole test for participants, such as vital sign examination, laboratory test, ECG, CT, MRI, ultrasound etc. Investigators screen these patients with a complete eligibility criteria. Then investigators proceed the therapy in the 1st, 8th and 15th day. There are 8 times of follow-up visit for these patients, 4 times of those are proceeded during the hospitalization, while other 4 times happens after the discharge. The follow-up visit includes vital sign examination, laboratory test, ECG, CT, MRI, ultrasound, Child-Pugh grade, MELD grade, SF-36 test. These follow-up visit last 24 weeks since the first treatment. After that, investigators also arrange a survival visit through phone or clinic each 6 months, lasting another 1.5 years. The main object of this research is investigating the survival rate, promotion of the liver function, improvement of health, safety of hUC-MSCs, tolerability of patients, for exploring a new way for the therapy of decompensated liver cirrhosis with HBV."

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment and can decrease their serum cholesterol to near normal levels (Bilheimer DW, N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1658-64). Shortage of donor organ is a major problem for OLT. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organ. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders (such as Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Fox IJ, et al. N Engl J Med 1998;338:1422-6), Factor VII deficiency (Dhawan A et al. Transplantation 2004:78:1812-4), Glycogen storage disease type Ia (Muraca M, et al. Lancet 2002;359:317-8), etc) by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. Although, in the in-vivo system there is a controversy that if stem cells transdifferentiate into hepatocytes or fusion of stem cells and hepatocytes occur, however, in the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented (Lee KD, et al. Hepatology 2004;40:1275-1284; & Banas A, et al. Hepatology. 2007;46:219-28). We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 female patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of ABO compatible healthy male volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes in the in-vitro culture system. Then the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."
