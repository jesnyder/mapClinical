It gives each person a 'score' (number) based on how urgently he or she needs a liver transplant within the next three months.\n\nThe number is calculated by a formula using three routine lab test results:\n\nMELD score = 3.8\u00d7ln[bilirubin (mg/dl)] + 11.2\u00d7ln(INR) + 9.6\u00d7ln[Scr(mg/dl)] + 6.4\u00d7(Cause: Bile or alcoholic 0, other 1) Bilirubin (mg/dl) = Bilirubin (\u03bcmol/L)/17.1 Scr(mg/dl) = Scr(\u03bcmol/L)/88.4",

The higher the score, the better the health status, and the more the patient able to tolerate the side effects of treatment, hence a better curative effect. It is generally believed that a Karnofsky score above 80 is independent, which means the patient is able to take care of himself. Karnofsky score between 50 to 70 stands for a semi-independent status, that is, the patient is semi-self-care. A score of 50 means the patients require help from others. Those with a score greater than 80 are in better postoperative state and have a longer survival period.\n\nThe lower the score, the worse the health status. If the score is less than 60, many effective anti-tumor treatments cannot be implemented.",
