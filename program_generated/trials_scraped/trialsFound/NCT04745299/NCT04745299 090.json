                              "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective and progressive loss of motor neurons. Disease progression leads to death within 2-4 years, but there exists no definite treatment so far.\n\nBased on phase I/II clinical trial(NCT01363401), twice intrathecal autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Lenzumestrocel) injections showed significant therapeutic benefit lasting at least six months with safety in patients with ALS.\n\nAdditionally, the switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory conditions, which was indicated from the inverse correlation between TGF-\u03b21 and MCP-1 levels after Lenzumestrocel injections in the good responder, has been considered a plausible beneficial action mechanism.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the following. First, to reconfirm and evaluate the long-term efficacy of twice injections (single cycle) of Lenzumestrocel, group 1 will receive a single cycle injection with a 26-day interval.\n\nSecond, to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Lenzumestrocel repeated injections, group 2 will receive a single cycle injection a 26-day apart followed by three times injections every three-month interval.\n\nGroup 3 will receive comparator injections."
