Functional assessment is based on ALSFRS-R scores and survival assessment is based on the period from randomization to physical death. Joint rank score will be calculated with ALSFRS-R score data and survival. For each pairwise comparison, a study participant is assigned a score and then the summed scores are ranked for all participants.\n\nThe higher ranking, the higher score, and the lower ranking, the lower score. And the average rank score is then calculated for each treatment group. A higher mean rank score indicates that participants in that treatment group, on average, fared better.\n\nThe difference in joint rank scores between multiple administration group and control group at 6 months.",

It consists of 12 items; 3 items for mouth functions, 4 items for upper limb and overall fine motor functions, 2 items for lower limb functions and 3 items for respiration functions. Each item is evaluated in 5-point scale (0~4).
