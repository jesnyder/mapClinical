The Implant Stability Quotient is a linear mapping from resonance frequency measured in kHz to the more clinically useful scale of 1-100 ISQ. The higher the ISQ, the more stable is the implant. The Implant stability is measured every fortnight for three months in 10 patients.The values on test side and control side are plotted on the graph and analysed."

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is the same increase in stem cell concentration in patients with osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head. Since the treatment of osteonecrosis is related to the severity of disease, namely articular cartilage collapse, the purpose of this study is to determine if the MSC concentration in synovial fluid can be correlated to disease stage."

Binomial confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level and p-values for these groups will be calculated. Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore the effect of administration of MSCs on the composite endpoint at 6-months of death, amputation revision and gangrene, and will be compared to historical cohorts.

Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4.

The exam is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body. Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0-5 according to the adjacent table, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0-2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. Each side of the body is graded independently. The ISNCSCI exam is used for determining the neurological level of injury.
