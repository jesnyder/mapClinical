Approximately 1 \u00d7 106/kg of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were administered by peripheral intravenous infusion once a month at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Routine medications were used.\n\nFollow-up: Patient follow-up was performed 7 times at 0, 4, 8, 20, 32, 48, and 60 weeks. Blood and urine were collected for determination of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-h urine protein ratio, liver and kidney function, fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, eGFR, blood lipids, and blood electrolytes at each follow-up visit. The daily dose of insulin was recorded. Blood samples were taken after each infusion of stem cells for flow cytometry and for the detection of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28+, Treg, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, CD83, and CD1a cells. Plasma levels of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, IL-12P70, IL-8, and IL-1 beta were also determined.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy within 60 weeks): The number and severity of adverse events, an evaluation of their association with the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell treatment, and the outcome of the adverse events.\n\nThe patients' discomfort and clinical symptoms during the study period were recorded.\n\nThe subjects' relevant laboratory test indices, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination results were recorded during the study.\n\nSecondary endpoint indicators:\n\nEfficacy measures: eGFR, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and percentage changes of 24-h urinary protein quantities from baseline to 60 weeks.\n\nData analysis:\n\nThe number of adverse events and the number of severity adverse events were determined based on the changes in the data summary (i.e., descriptive statistics).\n\nA multilevel statistical analysis model (mixed effects model) was used to infer the relationship between treatment factors and key indicators, reflect the changing trend of key indicators in different time periods, and draw statistical analysis conclusions."

These cells can provide efficient immunosuppression in severe conditions like immunosuppressive resistant Graft versus Host Disease. With this study at the first time and quite a different approach from conventional treatment, it will be tried an experimental treatment that used in the MSCs for the chronic autoimmune urticaria patients without of definitive treatment."

                              "Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional outcomes and quality of life. While less than 30% of patients experience short-term postoperative morbidity following IPAA, up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations. Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.\n\nPelvic sepsis following original IPAA has been reported in 5% to 25% of patients, and is the leading cause of pouch failure due to the development of pelvic fibrosis and decreased distensibility of the pouch, ultimately resulting in poor pouch function. One of the leading causes of pelvic sepsis and development of a pouch fistula is Crohn's Disease (CD) of the pouch. While the majority of pouches are constructed for UC, up to 25% of patients with an IPAA will end up having a change in diagnosis from UC to CD or development of de novo CD of the pouch.\n\nThe first report of successful healing of a Crohn's fistula with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was in 2003. Since them great enthusiasm has spurred several phase I phase II, and phase III trials designed to study the safety and efficacy of MSCs for perianal CD, all of which have reported encouraging results with regard to safety and efficacy. With over 300 patients now treated, there is a large body of evidence supporting the local delivery of MSCs to heal perianal Crohn's fistulas. Peri-pouch fistulas are similar to Crohn's perianal fistulas except that instead of the rectum containing the internal opening of the fistula, the internal opening is in the ileal pouch, constructed in place of the rectum.\n\nGiven the high safety profile and relative success in treating perianal Crohn's disease with mesenchymal stem cells, the investigators are using a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSC cell line to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients with ileal pouch fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. This trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals. The specific rationale for MSCs in IPAA is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory properties; 2) published experience of MSC in this condition and perianal Crohn's fistula demonstrating efficacy and safety; 3) existence of cGMP methods for their isolation and growth.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Patients who are refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Patients enrolled will be those that meet current indications."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been utilized in the treatment and prevention of graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, studies on MSC use in alloSCT from haploidentical donors (haploSCT) have been limited.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim 1) to evaluate MSCs' efficacy in GVHD prophylaxis and effect on engraftment of the haploidentical graft, 2) to improve the success rate of haploSCT by further decreasing GVHD incidence and graft failure rate. With higher haploSCT success rates, haploidentical donors would be important alternative graft sources in patients without HLA-matched donors.\n\nForty patients who present to Ankara University, School of Medicine, Division of Hematology with hematological malignancies and have indications for haploSCT will be included in the study after informed consent is obtained. MSCs will be procured and isolated from donor bone marrows. MSCs will be isolated, cultured, and stored in the good manufacturing practice (GMP) laboratory in Ankara University Stem Cell Institute. Donor bone marrow will be harvested, four to six weeks prior to transplantation, for MSC isolation and culture. Patients will receive either an ablative or non-ablative induction regimen based on their age, diagnosis, and the disease status at the time of transplantation. Donor bone marrow will be harvested a second time on the day of transplantation and the procured bone marrow graft will be infused to the patient the same day. GVHD prophylaxis will include post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy) on days +3 and +4 (50 mg/kg/day), tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Stored MSCs will be infused to the patient on day +6. The endpoints include graft failure rate, GVHD incidence, transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, and overall survival.\n\nThe investigators aim to evaluate the utility of MSCs in improving haploSCT results and to enhance the reliability and success of haploSCT. Successful transplants from haploidentical donors would ameliorate the problem of matched donor paucity in countries with a limited number of hematopoietic stem cell donors, such as Turkey, and would establish haploidentical donors an alternative donor source for patients without matched donors in Turkey. As haploidentical donors may be parents or children, rapid and easy access to donors would decrease wait times for alloSCT. Moreover, national current account deficit may be reduced through using grafts obtained from haploidentical donors residing in Turkey instead of grafts from foreign stem cell/umbilical cord banks.\n\nIn this project, the investigators seek to develop clinical therapy applications in concordant with the ambition of \"renewal and repair of human cells, tissues, and organs through cellular therapy and cellular products\" that is included in the The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey 1003 Call for Projects."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) can cure many hematologic diseases. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, poor graft function (PGF) remains an important complication that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or repeat transplantation, but these methods are associated with short-term effect and a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease\uff08GVHD\uff09 development, respectively.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of PGF that develops after allo-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor is rarely reported. If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with PGF after allo-HSCT."

                              "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) are considered the standard of care for many malignancies, such as lymphoma, myeloma and some leukemias, and so on. Graft failure after auto-HSCT is a formidable complication. It occurs in 2-9.5% of patients and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections and hemorrhagic complications. There are various options for the management of graft failure. The most common treatment of graft failure is growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)and recombinant erythropoietin,but it usually effective in the short term and no effect on platelet counts.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and so on.As an important source of hematopoietic stem cell, cord blood has been widely used in clinical practice. It is reported that cord blood combined with MSCs can increase engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, to our knowledge, the report about efficacy of treatment of graft that develops after auto-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor combined with cord blood is absent.If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors or MSCs combined with cord blood in treating patients with graft failure after auto-HSCT."

Today, insulin injection is a routine treatment for diabetes. Although injected insulin maintains blood glucose, this method cannot result in physiologic reaction to blood glucose changes. Moreover, patients are encountered with diabetes complications like neuropathy, nephropathy, visual and cardiovascular problems, and hypoglycemic unawareness. Therefore, based on previous studies, a treatment option that leads to pancreatic beta cell restoration and inhibits the immune response to these cells could be a hopeful clinical choice. In this clinical trial, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be used for immune response modulation and improving regeneration. Hence, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 patients with type-1 diabetes will be selected and after clarifying the procedure and fulfilling the agreement to participate in this trial, they will be sorted in two groups. Bone marrow is aspirated from patients bone and after isolation of Mesenchymal stem cells and characterization of these cells, patients in case group will be intravenously injected by 1 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells per kg of patient's body weight in each dose in week 0 and 3, whereas the control group receives a placebo. Then patients will be followed up for 1 year. During this time, different parameters would be evaluated in weeks 1, 2,4, and Months 2,3,6,9 and 12. Laboratory screenings will be done during this period to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment."

                              "Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant has become first choice of treatment for many malignant and non malignant haematological disorders. Although great progress has been made to prevent and minimize transplant-associated complications, yet graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains a significant complication affecting these the outcome in these patients. It is a severe inflammatory condition that arises when recipient tissues are attacked by immune mediated donor T cells during transplantation. Acute GVHD predominately affects the skin, upper and lower GI tract, liver and occasionally the eye and oral mucosa, whereas chronic GVHD resembles more with autoimmune disorders in its clinical symptoms. These symptoms can be organ-specific or generalized throughout body.\n\nThe pathophysiology of GVHD shows that it has different phases. In first phase i.e., afferent phase, damage to host tissue occurs. In second phase i.e., Induction and expansion phase, donor T cells are triggered and activated by recipient and donor APC as well as the inflammatory cytokines. Activated T cells produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 (or Th1 response). Allogeneic immune response is amplified by IL-2, which activates more T cells and natural killer cell responses, triggering macrophages to release TNF-\u03b1 and further inflammation damages skin and gut. The third phase i.e., effector phase, is characterized by cytotoxic damage against host cells by activated donor T-cell-mediated through Fas-Fas ligand interaction, perforin-granzyme and TNF-\u03b1. The latter has a central role in the pathophysiology, stimulating cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1). This dysregulation leads to the clinical manifestations of acute GVHD.\n\nThe cells involved in GVHD pathophysiology include CD4+ T cells; for maintaining the expansion of CD8+ T cells that mediate GVHD, APCs; these have role in the initiation phase of acute GVHD as described in murine models and Natural killer (NK) cells; contribute to tissue damage in the effector phase by releasing inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. However, natural killer cells mediate cell death by two important pathways: Fas-Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis and perforin-granzyme-B-mediated cytolysis.\n\nHLA differences between donor and recipient are the major predictor of GVHD. Other affecting factors include age, gender mismatch between donor and recipient, minor histocomapatability antigen expression difference(mHA) in otherwise identical HSCT, donor age, source and dose of stem cells (PBSCT greater risk than BM), intensity of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nSteroids are the first line therapy for acute GVHD patients and are standard treatment for grade II-IV acute GVHD. Adverse effects of glucocorticoids include hypertension hyperglycemia and psychosis, immunosuppression, infections, myopathy, osteoporosis and avascular necrosis of bone, cataracts and fat re-distribution etc. If acute GVHD is not improved after 5-7 days treatment with steroids then it is considered as steroid-refractory. Various agents that are being investigated from last two decades as second line therapy include low-dose MTX, MMF, extracorporeal photopheresis, IL-2R targeting, antibody therapy against CD3, CD7, CD25, CD52, CD147, IL-2R, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 (i.e., basiliximab, daclizumab, denileukin, diftitox and alemtuzumab), horse ATG, etanercept, infliximab, and sirolimus and recently infusions of mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as self-renewing, multipotent progenitor cells with potential to differentiate into other cell types of mesodermal origin, such as adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy developed the minimal criteria for definition of MSCs which is as follows: first, adherence to plastic; Second, positivity for the cell-surface molecules CD105, CD73, and CD90 and negativity for CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR; and third, the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts under standard in vitro differentiation conditions. Since Le Blanc and colleagues first reported successful treatment of a patient with severe acute GVHD using third-party haploidentical MSCs in 2004, many clinical trials worldwide have described the benefits of MSC therapy in GVHD.\n\nThe proposed project is a phase I/II clinical trial of single group, open label, interventional study design. The objective is to observe the safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of ex-vivo expanded bone marrow mesenchymal cells from a third party donor for treating refractory GVHD. The study will also document the type and frequency of any adverse event or side effects, if discovered."

                              "The prospective randomized study is carried out at orthopaedic and traumatology, haematology and radiology departments. 50 patients were included in the study. Of the 25 patients in both groups, Group I (received the concentrate of marrow MSCs into the tendon- bone contact point at the site of the suture during surgery ) consisted of 7 women and 18 men ( mean age 51,2 years ), Group II ( without the use of MSCs ) consisted of 15 women and 10 men ( mean age 50,5 years ). Selection of patients into both groups was performed using permutation block randomization computer software Random Number Generator Software 7.0. All of radiographs/MRI/CT results were evaluated by an experienced radiologist specialized in musculoskeletal pathologies, that was blinded to the both groups of patients. Before entering the study, patients signed an informed consent created by the Ethical Committee of local hospital and were randomly assigned to one of the treatment possibilities with use of the Random Number Generator Software 7.0 by the method 1:1.\n\nBefore the surgical treatment, patients completed a questionnaire with VAS score, ASES score ( American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form ) and the Constant score. Further clinical control with completing these questionnaires is 6 months after surgery, 1 year after surgical treatment, 2, 5 and ten years postoperatively. Two years after the surgery MRI examination of the shoulder joint is performed. All of the outpatient clinical evaluations during the study were performed by the orthopaedic surgeon blinded to the both groups of patients.\n\nThe actual therapy was as follows: open surgery was preceded by a standard diagnostic arthroscopy, which was performed from the posterior portal for optics and anterior portal for arthroscopic instruments. The tendons of the rotator cuff were assessed from both sides - intraarticular and subacromial. To evaluate cuff tendon injury perioperatively and to measure the rupture width, a special arthroscopic hook calibrated in 1 mm was used. To evaluate the shape of the rupture, the classification of Ellman - Gartsman was used. Surgical treatment of injured tendons of the rotator cuff was performed in the beach chair position of the patient, by the deltoid muscle split approach. After evaluation of the extent and location of the cuff tendon lesion the aspiration of 10 ml of bone marrow blood was done ( from the humeral head through the same surgical approach ) into a 20 mL syringe prefilled with 0.5 ml of heparin with the Yamshidi needle. Aspiration of the bone marrow was performed by surgeon. From one bone puncture was aspirated maximally 3 ml of marrow blood. Centrifugation of the aspirate in 10 ml test-tube Monovette filled with citrate followed. Selected centrifugation regime consisted of gradient 15 minute centrifugation at 200 g RCF ( relative centrifugal force ). After such a centrifugation the tube contents is divided into three parts. The upper layer consists of the platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the middle layer of the buffy coat with the dominant proportion of leukocytes, and the lower layer is formed by sedimented erythrocytes. Using a sterile laboratory pipette, a collection of the buffy coat was performed. MSCs represented 0.01 to 0.02 % of all nuclear elements of the buffy coat, that is about 10 x 106 / l. The MSCs concentrate ( similar to synovial fluid in consistency and colour ) was impregnated into the collagen patch Hypro-Sorb F ( Otrokovice, Czech Republic ) of dimensions 1x2 cm. The collagen patch as a carrier of the MSCs concentrate was used to ensure its retention in desired place. This material was then inserted between the tendon and bone, into the place of re-fixing of the rotator cuff tendons ( footprint ) before tightening the threads of the anchors. Fixation of the tendon to the bone was made by a double row method with use of absorbable fixation anchors BioComposite Corkscrew ( Arthrex, Munich, Germany ). In all such treated cases the tendon was fixed in place of original attachment without any stress and without the need of abduction of the arm above 60 degrees. All patients underwent Neer acromioplasty for an increase of the subacromial space. This procedure was followed by the standard surgical wound closure in all anatomical layers, sterile dressing of the wound and by applying of the abduction orthosis. All patients were operated by the same orthopaedic surgeon with the same surgical technique. Open surgery instead of arthroscopy was chosen because of the safer fixation of the MSCs carrier under the re-inserted tendon and to reduce the risk of washout of the MSCs concentrate from the carrier during the arthroscopy.\n\nSurgical treatment of patients in Group II was identical as in Group I, except the aspiration of bone marrow from the humeral head and subsequent application of the scaffold saturated with MSCs into the tendon / bone interface.\n\nAbduction fixation lasted for 4 weeks. Passive motion over the horizontal line under the guidance of a physiotherapeutist was initiated the first postoperative day. After removing the fixation, an active rehabilitation began, that is a full range of motion exercises done actively 6 weeks after surgery. Full load was allowed 12 weeks after the surgery.\n\nOutpatient follow-up took place according to the schedule mentioned above. To check the integrity of the tendon at the point of insertion into the greater tuberosity of the humerus, MRI of the shoulder joint was performed 2 years postoperatively. Both, preoperative and postoperative MRI examinations were performed with a 1.5T high-field scanner, in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes, in T1- and T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences ( MRI arthrography using gadollinium as a contrast medium ). All of MRI results were evaluated by an experienced radiologist specialized in musculoskeletal pathologies. He evaluated tendon integrity, presence and localisation of complete retear, tendon and muscle borders, and presence of abnormal artifacts.\n\nThe primary hypothesis of this study is that the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the supraspinatus tendon reconstruction surgery will have a positive effect in the assessment of both subjective and objective scoring systems, and also in terms of reducing the number of tendon reruptures compared to the patients population in which mesenchymal stem cells were not used. All data were statistically analyzed with STATISTICA 9.0 programme. To compare the results of the of the VAS score, the Constant score, and the ASES score preoperatively and one year after the surgery Student\u00b4s t- test was used, to compare the incidence of reruptures between both groups of patients 2 years postoperatively Chi-square test was used. The significance level was determined at p <0.05. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment possibilities with use of the Random Number Generator Software 7.0 by the method 1:1"

                              "The role of regenerative therapies has gained more importance due to increased number of SCI in the wake of recent anti-terrorism operations by the armed forces and non-availability of any curative treatment for this category of patients. The promising results of preliminary clinical trials have proved that adult stem cells especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells can be safely injected and well tolerated and have shown functional improvement in SCI patients. The successful treatment in these patients will not only improve functional status of these otherwise debilitating patients, but can also reduce the burden on health care facilities. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression. In this study patients suffering from sub-acute and chronic phase of spinal cord injury shall be included. Patients will undergo detailed screening through MRI and motor and sensory assessment by ASIA score. Further evaluation will include electromyography (EMG) and tests for electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) will also be done. Bone marrow aspiration will be done from iliac crest of the patients, followed by mononuclear cells (MNCs) separation by density gradient centrifugation. MNCs will be washed and cultured in tissue culture flasks. After 48 hours non-adherent cells will be removed from culture. Medium will be changed twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence. At that point MSCs will be harvested and after microbiological and other quality control testing the cellular preparation will be diluted to final concentration and infused by intrathecal injection.\n\nPrimary outcome measure is safety which will be determined by clinical evaluation by two independent neurologists during one month of hospital stay after receiving treatment course.\n\nSecondary outcome measures will include American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and NCV/EMG."

The main cause of its pathogenesis is the compensatory hyperplasia of the articular cartilage caused by the body's degenerative changes, which will eventually cause the joint to partially or completely lose its function.\n\nIn the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made to treat OA. The treatment of OA changes with the development of the patient's condition. At present, there are many diagnosis and treatment options for knee OA, including conservative treatment and surgical treatment. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to postpone or terminate the course of OA.\n\nCell therapy for OA has developed rapidly in recent years and has received widespread attention. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with potential of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells are extracted from the patient's body and then implanted back. Their ability of regeneration and reproduction can fill the damaged cartilage tissue, so as to achieve an effective treatment of the joint damage.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction of joint pain, and restoration of joint function."

                              "Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN< 0.2 \u00d7 109/L).\n\nAllogeneic BMT from an HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor is the treatment of choice for patients with aplastic anaemia.Transplantation for patients with severe aplastic anaemia from an HLA identical sibling donor is now very successful with a 75-90% chance of long term cure and with overall survival of between 65% and 73% at 5 years for matched-alternative donor transplantation. However, these two approachs are limited by the availability of HLA-matched donors.\n\nPatients without HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor can be offered immunosuppressive treatment (IST) involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). The treatment response with ATG is at best between 60-80%, 30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment. Moreover, a recent study has shown that on multivariate analysis of response at 6 months, only younger age, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), correlate with response to ATG. Patients with SAA or vSAA, with much lower ARC and ALC, were poor response to IST and have high risks of dying of infection and bleeding.\n\nNowadays, with advances in transplant technology, HLA-mismatched related donors and unrelated donors transplantation has achieved good clinical results. Data from the XJ Huang indicated that patients with HLA-mismatched related donors achieved 100% donor myeloid engraftment and have a survival rate of 64.6\u00b112.4%. Retrospectively analyzed results for 154 patients with acquired SAA who received BMT from unrelated donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program showed the probability of OS at 5 years was 56% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%).\n\nCompared with malignant disease, mismatched related donor or unrelated donor HSCT for SAA involves distinct challenges mainly associated with high graft failure and high GVHD. So, if we can find a way to promote implantation meanwhile prevent or reduce GVHD , the efficacy of HLA-mismatched related donors transplantation can improve.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non-hematopoietic progenitors mainly found in BM, cord blood, and adipose tissue. MSCs are attractive because of the ease with which they can be isolated and expanded ex vivo, their ability to undergo multilineage differentiation, and their lack of immunogenicity. These cells were shown to provide support for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in BM micro-environments. In additon, preliminary studies have shown clinical effectiveness of allogeneic MSC in the treatment of refractory graft-versus-host disease and an improvement in or resolution of severe aGVHD when co-transplantation with MSCs. Due to these properties, MSCs have become an interesting candidate for use in cellular therapy and are considered \"theoretically perfect cells\" for potential clinical use against AA mismatched related donors transplantation."

In recent years, full endoscopic discectomy has been widely used in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation due to its advantages of reduced trauma, enhanced recovery and less cost. However, the reherniation of the residual nucleus pulposus still exist after nerve root decompression. It is urgent to use stem cell and tissue engineering to replace the resection tissue and repair the residual nucleus pulposus for disc resealing. To observe the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) in the treatment of lumbar disc degeneration. This clinical trial is aimed to include a single group of 20 patients with lumbar disc herniation. Twenty million hUCMSCs will be injected into the lumbar disc of the enrolled patients in this non-random, self-controlled and single-dose open study design. The patients will be followed up for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the injection to evaluate the safety of the patients after grafting hUCMSCs. Additionally, improvement of patients' quality of life will be evaluated using the ODI score, VAS score and SF-36 score. Lumbar disc signals will be also quantified using MRI to demonstrate hUCMSCs transplantation could slow down lumbar disc degeneration."

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.\n\nThis study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.\n\nPatients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months post initial injection."

Studies include formal measurement of blood and urinary markers of kidney function, BOLD MR and multidetector CT scanning. Forty-two non-diabetic patients between 40 and 80 years of any race or ethnicity will be recruited. All will have hypertension (defined as BP\u2265140/90 mmHg or ongoing antihypertensive drug therapy) but will have less than 180 mmHg to be included (with or without drug therapy). These subjects will be free of cardiovascular events within 3 months and will not have implanted electrical devices, such as a pacemaker or defibrillator. All patients will have identified large vessel renovascular disease (RVD) for Aims 1, 2 and 3. At least 10% of these subjects will be of African-American descent (self-identified) and recruited in collaboration with the University of Mississippi under the direction of Dr. Luis Juncos and the University of Alabama under the direction of Dr. David Calhoun. For completion of Aims 2 and 3, a three-day evaluation will be repeated between three and four months later, and ongoing safety and imaging studies will be performed up to 24 months after MSC administration. Participants in these protocols will undergo transvenous kidney biopsy under the direction of Drs. McKusick and Misra and their colleagues in Interventional Radiology.

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage organ failure. Despite dramatic improvements in short-term survival, long-term survival of renal allografts has changed little during the past decade. Recently, it has been demonstrated that chronic lesions originate already very early after transplantation and that subclinical rejection (SCR) in protocol biopsies is a risk factor for late graft loss. However the efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids and other therapies for the treatment of SCR have been shown to be inadequate. Thus, despite the availability of a range of available medications there remains a need for therapeutic alternatives because patients may not respond to existing therapeutic choices, they do not show an improvement of the fibrosis reaction or an effect on long term survival, or they may develop immunosuppression induced serious (sometimes fatal) side effects and toxicities.\n\nIn recent years it has become evident that bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells have potent immunomodulatory effects. MSCs are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. MSCs have potent immunosuppressive effects on T and B cells in vitro and in animal models of chronic inflammation. Encouraging results have been obtained in patients with steroid resistant acute and severe Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). The investigators hypothesize that infusion of MSCs may similarly provide a novel treatment option in the treatment of patients with allograft rejection with less side effects than existing immunosuppressive therapies.This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of MSC therapy in renal recipients.\n\nIn total 15 de novo renal recipients of 2 HLA-DR mismatched living donors, men and women, 18-65 years of age, will be recruited from the renal transplant clinics of the LUMC. Only patients with SCR abd or an increase in IF/TA in the protocol biopsy 4 weeks or 6 months after transplantation will receive MSC infusions. MSCs from patients without SCR in their biopsy will be only used for feasibility and function studies (as described earlier). Subjects will receive two doses of 1 x 10.6 MSCs per kilogram body weight, intravenously, 7 days apart. The investigators will investigate safety of MSC therapy by assessing the rate of (serious) adverse events in the study population using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Feasibility will be obtained by determining the number of expanded MSCs in relation to the amount of BM collected, number of passages required and time to reach study target doses."

The mortality of aGVHD is positively correlated with its severity. At present, glucocorticoids is still the first line treatment of aGVHD.

This study will be performed under this current IND application and will be limited to the proposed 19 subjects (5 subjects in each of two dose escalating subject cohorts, and 5 subjects in a \"boost dose\" group who previously received MSC as part of the previous phase 1a study which included 9 patients\n\nIn this application we are proposing to evaluate safety and feasibility of allogeneic, bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to induce remission of moderate treatment refractory bronchiolitis obliterans (BO/BOS). Lung transplant patients with treatment refractory BO/BOS (grade 3) who do not qualify for a second transplant have near 100% mortality or extreme disability. MSCs are multi-potent cells that have the capacity to induce tissue repair and modulate immune response. They have been used successfully in preclinical and clinical studies to treat graft versus host disease (GVHD) and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients that progressed to moderate BO despite adequate medical treatments and who do not qualify for a second transplant will receive intravenous treatments of allogeneic MSC. The safety measure will include tolerance of MSC infusion and absence of significant cardiopulmonary compromise. The feasibility assessment will include ease of recruitment, practical issue of transporting, preparing and infusing the MSCs.\n\nThe clinical assessment from this initial safety study is intended to demonstrate safety of human MSC in subjects with BO and to evaluate the cell dose that demonstrates signs of efficacy. Pending favorable safety results and pharmacokinetic and pharamcodynamic data obtained in the current proposed study we will likely conduct additional human studies with a more directed focus on the evaluation of efficacy while collecting additional safety information."

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is notoriously difficult to cure with 37% of patients experiencing refractory disease. As a result, patients cycle through numerous immunosuppressive medications that can have significant side effects, and >90% undergo multiple surgical interventions putting them at risk of incontinence.\n\nThe specific rationale for MSCs in perianal Crohn's fistulas is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; 2) several studies reporting the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of perianal Crohn's fistula; 3) existence of safe manufacturing methods for isolation and expansion of MSCs.\n\nThis study will enroll 20 participants that have Crohn's disease with medically and surgically refractory perianal fistulizing disease. Participants enrolled will be those that meet particular criteria for participation in the clinical trial.\n\nEnrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved, participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and again three months after this as above, and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months."

Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved patients will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the six month visit to receive an injection of MSCs, and will be followed for one year after treatment for a total duration of 18 months."

After a two to six week screening period, subjects will have a Baseline visit (Days 1-2) where they will undergo a single intravenous infusion of up to 5 x 10EE6 allogeneic hMSCs/kg of body weight. Infusions will be performed in the Dahms Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Subjects will be monitored for any infusion related toxicities for 24 hours after the infusion. Subsequent study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, Months 3 and 6 and telephone calls will occur on Days 4 (or 5), 21, 56 and Month 12. Subject safety and tolerability of a single dose of hMSCs will be evaluated at study visits by review of subject diaries, interval history, pulmonary exacerbations, physical examination, spirometry, and analysis of safety laboratories. Special attention will be placed upon detecting pulmonary exacerbations because anti-inflammatory therapies theoretically could suppress the immune system to the point where it leads to increased infectious complications, although MSC therapeutics are proposed to be antimicrobial. In addition to evaluating safety, this study will also explore efficacy end-points for future clinical trials of MSCs in CF including inflammatory biomarkers from blood and sputum. Serum markers (calprotectin, MPO, GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL8, IL-17, and TNF-a) and sputum markers (white cell counts and differentials, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, GM-CSF, MIP- 3a, TNF-a, and active proteases including neutrophil elastase, a1-anti-trypsin, and MMP-9) will be determined at Baseline and on Days 7 and 28 for with-in subject comparison. All subject samples will be archived for future projects. Finally, a diagnostic bone marrow exam will be performed on subjects with CF who consent to undergo this optional procedure. Bone marrow samples will be banked and used for future translational studies."

This can lead to pain, decreased shoulder function, and the need for corrective surgery. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to improve healing rates in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, primarily due to their retained ability to differentiate into several different adult cell lines, such as tenocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. MSCs further enhance the healing process by releasing growth factors into the local environment to promote tissue regeneration.\n\nWhile MSC augmentation of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has led to higher rates of healing and improved tendon integrity, there remains a paucity of data surrounding clinical improvement after the procedure. Outcomes such as post-operative strength, range of motion, and shoulder function have yet to be compared with standard rotator cuff repair. The incidence of post-operative persistent structural defects in the tendon after MSC augmentation must also be further elucidated."

However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy."

(MSCs) have been reported to secrete various cytokines that exhibit angiogenic and neuro supportive effects.\n\nStudy Design Experimental interventional study. phase II clinical trial\n\nEthical committee approval (was it ethically approved by the department) Internal medicine department Yes\n\nStudy Methods\n\nPopulation of study & disease condition (e.g women with hepatitis, \u2026\u2026\u2026) Diabetic patients(type I, type II) with documented peripheral neuropathy as determined by impaired nerve conduction\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n(Type I, type II) diabetic patients age range (18-45) years, with diabetic peripheral neuropathy proved by clinical assessment and nerve conduction who did not receive treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nDecompensated cardiac, renal or liver disease. Associated autoimmune diseases Associated endocrinal diseases Pregnancy, usage of contraceptive pills or steroids.\n\nMethodology in details The study will be conducted on patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy collected from internal medicine department(inpatient and out patients, males and females)\n\nAll subjects of this study will be submitted to the following :( preparatory visit before (MSCs) transfusion visit.)\n\nThorough clinical assessment as a general assessment of the patient, also assessment of diabetes complications especially diabetic neuropathy. This is including full history and examinations (e.g., pain, sensory loss, ulcers, sensory level, etc\u2026.) this preparatory assessment will be done at internal medicine department.\nVenous blood will be drawn in the morning after an overnight fast in the pre (MSCs) transfusion visit.\n\nPlasma biochemical blood measurements will be determined by standard laboratory procedures in the central lab at clinical pathology department, Kasr Alaini hospital)\n\nFasting blood glucose level, 2 hours postprandial.\nC-peptide.\nHb A1C.\nBasic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by ELISA.\nComplete blood picture.\nLiver functions in the form of ALT, AST\n\nKidney functions in the form of serum creatinine.\n\nfundus examination\nNerve conduction study at neurophysiology unit.\nBone marrow aspiration of about 90 ml under local anesthesia once at the first visit after preparatory visit mentioned before, the patient will be admitted for 12 hours and will be monitored closely to avoid anaphylaxis (by steroids, anti-allergic treatment), if no complication, will be discharged.\n\nTo avoid infection: During bone marrow aspiration, procedure will be done under complete aseptic precautions, placed in sterile tubes containing pre-servative-free heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) Separation and processing of the sample will be done under good manufacture procedure (GMP): Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) will be withdrawn under good sterilization of the skin in an isolated area. Processing of the sample will be done in the laminar air flow; all supplies are disposable and sterile.\n\nTechnique:\n\nSeparation of mononuclear cells:\n\nThe bone marrow aspirate will be diluted at a ratio of 6:1 with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 2 mM EDTA (30 ml BM aspirate+ 5 ml PBS/EDTA buffer). The MNCs will be separated under aseptic conditions using a Ficoll. Hypaque desity gradient (density 1.077, GibcoBRL, Grand Islan, NY, USA) by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 20 min then the MNCs will be plated in 40 ml alpha-modi-field Eagle's medium (\u03b1MEM), serum free media; mesencult(Mesenchymal stem cell culture),penicillin (100 U/ml),streptomycin(10 mg/ml),0.5 ml amphotericin B(all from Gibco BRL) and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN) and will be incubated at 370 c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 (Digirolamo et al.1999).after one day ,non adherent cells will be cultured in the presence of Mesenchymal media for 3 weeks changed every 1 week (cambrex Bioscience ,Nottingham, uk). After reaching 80% confluence the MSCs will be placed in 10 ml saline and will be infused intravenously\n\nFlow cytometry Surface expression of MSCs using anti- (CD271, CD34, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD29) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will be analyzed using flow cytometry. MSCs (2X105 cells) will be suspended in PBS containing 1% BSA and will be stained with flurochrome -conjugated mAbs for 20 minutes on ice (anti-mouse mAanti-CD 271, CD34 CD73, CD90, CD105,CD29; BD Bioscience, MN, USA).flow cytometric analysis will be performed using a FACSCaliber (BD bioscience)equipped with cell Quest software.10000 cells will be passed in front of the laser for each sample. Each sample will be analyzed in duplicate. A cut off value at 20% will be set to categorize samples as positive.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells will be identified by morphology and immunophenotyping in the central lab at clinical pathology department, Kasr Alaini hospital( stem cell lab).\n\nMesenchymal stem cells transfusion slowly intravenous will be applied after these procedures for the patients after taking their approval and informed consent.\n\nFollow up 3 months after Mesenchymal stem cells transfusion by fasting blood glucose level, 2 hours postprandial, C-peptide, Hb A1C, (bFGF), (VEGF) and nerve conduction at kasr Alaini hospital departments as mentioned before.\n\nPossible Risk (mention if there is any risk or not) Anaphylaxis Infection\n\nPrimary outcomes (Most important outcomes to be assessed)\n\n1- Effect of mesenchymal stem cells transfusion on diabetic peripheral neuropathy regarding improvement of clinical symptoms like pain, sensory loss and improvement of nerve conduction.\n\nSecondary outcome parameters (other outcomes to be assessed)\n\nMesenchymal stem cells being a treatment modality in diabetes complications like peripheral neuropathy, to avoid hazards on patients secondary to diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\nImproving of diabetic condition like lowering of blood glucose level, decrease in insulin requirements and improvement of general condition.\n\nSample size (number of participants included) 10 diabetic patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy .\n\nSource of funding (is there any source of funds or not) Faculty Of Medicine, Cairo University.\n\nTime plan (when to start/ when expected to finish/ when to publish) At least 20 months"

It has been reported that MSCs can suppress maturation, activation and proliferation of T, B, NK and DC cell in vitro and downregulate immune response in vivo. MSCs are presently being cotransplantated with hematopoietic stem cell, which can facilitates engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells and prevent GVHD. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Patients with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body. Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can involve tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas of the body. The origin of autoantibody production in SLE is unclear but a role has been suggested for an antigen driven process, spontaneous B-cell hyper-responsiveness, or impaired immune regulation.\n\nThe BXSB mouse strain spontaneously develops a progressive and lethal autoimmune disease, similar to human SLE. In our previous work we found that transplantation of MSCs could alleviate the symptoms of BXSB mouse.\n\nThis study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of expanded autologous MSC infusions in patients with primary and treatment -refractory SLE. This study will last 2 years. Participants will be assigned to receive either the prednisone (Group 1) or MSC infusions alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study on Day 0. One year post- infusions, Patients will be clinically assessed and evaluated for MSC and disease response, and participants will undergo kidney biopsies at 12 Months."

                              "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of efficacy with disease progression.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype, morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.\n\nBM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes' markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals. Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and practical way for PD."

Pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies to SCI get limited effect. Another promising therapeutic approaches for SCI is cellular transplantation. Cell types used in SCI therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in SCI treatment.\n\nMSC have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing ,axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression.\n\nThe clinical translation of cellular transplantation strategies requires a safe and efficient means of cellular delivery. In animal models of SCI, the most common delivery is direct injection into the injury site, which allows a defined number of cells to be delivered, but risks further injuring the cord. Less invasive methods for cell delivery have been investigated, including intravascular delivery (intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial) and delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal). These minimally-invasive techniques decrease the risk to the patient and allow delivery of multiple cell doses. Maybe intrathecal administration is superior to IV delivery, cell engraftment and tissue sparing were significantly better after intrathecal delivery, but more researches are needed for get conclusion."

                              "Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN< 0.2 \u00d7 109/L). Patients with nSAA can be offered supportive care, anabolic steroids, and/or low-dose steroids or cyclosporine (CsA).Patients with SAA and vSAA can be offered immunosuppressive treatment involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). However, some nSAA patients remains dependent to transfusion, the treatment response with ATG for SAA is at best between 50-60%,30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment, they also do not have a HLA-matched donor for bone marrow transplantation. These patients have a high risk of dying without additional treatment. Since the prognosis of these refractory and relapsed AA patients remains poor, there is a need for more safe and effective therapy that can improve response rates and remission duration in refractory and relapsed AA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are part of the bone marrow stem cells repertoire. The main role of MSCs is to support hematopoiesis. Recently, significant interactions between MSCs and cells from the immune system have been demonstrated:MSCs were found to downregulate T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK) and antigen presenting cells through various mechanisms, including cell-to-cell interaction and soluble factor production. MSCs can fully suppress T cell function which involves some degree of MSC activation or 'licensing' thought to involve interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in conjunction with IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or tumour necrosis factor-a. Non-specific suppression of T cell proliferation is mediated by soluble factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide, haem oxygenase products and insulin-like growth factor binding protein. Since the haematopoietic support and immunomodulatory effects, bone marrow-derived human MSCs transplantation maybe a safe novel therapeutic approach for patients with refractory and relapsed AA."

                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death from COVID-19. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the storm of cytokines and chemokines, which cause uncontrolled fatal systemic inflammation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells that express the angiotensin II converting enzyme receptor (ACE2). This receptor is widely distributed on the surface of type II alveolar cells (AT2) and on the capillary endothelium. This is why the cytokine storm will trigger a violent attack by the immune system on the body, cause ARDS and multiple organ failure, and can ultimately lead to death. Mortality in cases of severe SIRA caused by COVID 19 varies significantly between 50 and 90%, basically depending on the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nThe plasticity of Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) regulates inflammation and immunity. MSC can promote and inhibit an immune response, depending on the dynamics of inflammation and depending on the activation force of the immune system, the types of inflammatory cytokines present, and the effects of immunosuppressants. Essentially, the state of inflammation determines the immunoregulatory fate of MSC. Thus, IV application of MSC has been shown to control the inflammatory response in various diseases, such as the graft-versus-host reaction and the ARDS caused by H5NI.\n\nMSC are negative for ACE2, therefore they have been used to decrease the cytokine storm present in COVID-19.\n\nTwo recent studies in China have used human allogeneic MSC to treat COVID-19 pneumonia. Both studies reveal a marked reversal of symptoms, even in critically serious cases. Lung function improved two days after MSC application and 10 days later they were discharged. Lymphocytes increased, PCR decreased, and cytokine-producing immune cells disappeared within 3 to 6 days. Regulatory immune cells increased. TNF alpha factor decreased and IL10 increased.\n\nTaking into account the previous concepts together with the current global pandemic, and the high mortality existing among patients with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe ARDS, the investigators propose intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells from bank laboratory, with the purpose partially proven to decrease the systemic inflammatory process, offering it as a salvage treatment.\n\nFive patients, of either sex, over 18 years of age, with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe ARDS that has not improved in relation to the following parameters: a) Persistent PaO2 / FiO2 less than 150, b) persistent fever, c ) D-dimer increase of at least 50% of baseline and / or ferritin greater than 1000, after 48 h of hospital stay receiving the standard management measures used at that time in the care center, will be included in the study. Covid pneumonia should be confirmed by chest CT and RNA detection by positive SARS-Cov2 PCR. This treatment will be administered after discussing it with the relatives that it is a procedure considered as rescue and will be carried out with informed consent.\n\nTheir follow-up will be daily while they are hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and / or hospitalized, until their discharge from the hospital or until the third week after surgery. If the patient has already been discharged from the hospital, his last evaluation will be in the third week.\n\nThe main objective of this protocol is: To describe the clinical changes secondary to IV administration of MSC, in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, with the evaluation of the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as of the fever curve daily.\n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n\na) To assess the effect of the proposed treatment on the general biochemical indicators (Leukocytes, absolute lymphocytes, absolute neutrophils, absolute monocytes, absolute eosinophils, absolute basophils, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, total bilirubin, albumin, amino-aspartate transferase, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, glomerular filtration, myoglobin, troponin, ferritin and D-dimer. Daily.\n\nb. To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the proposed treatment with assessment of the levels of cytokines, and C-reactive protein, TNFa, IL10, IL1, IL6, IL17, VEGF in plasma. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\nc. Assess the radiological evolution of the proposed treatment through simple chest CT. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\nd. Evaluate immune system improvement with mass cytometry to analyze patients' immune cells: regulatory T cells (CXCR3-), dendritic cells (DC, CXCR3-), CXCR3 + CD4 + T, CXCR3 + CD + T, and CXCRT3 + NK. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\ne) Assess the safety of the proposed treatment (allergic reactions and / or infection) F. To assess the negativization of the RNA detection test by SARS-Cov2 PCR. These variables will be evaluated before treatment, upon discharge from the ICU, and / or from the Hospital.\n\nThe inclusion criteria are:\n\nComply with the informed consent procedure and sign the informed consent form.\nOver 18 years\nOf any gender\nWith SARS-Cov2 PCR RNA detection test, positive\nWith bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19\nSevere ARDS with PaO2 / FiO2 less than 150\nThat it has not improved in relation to: a) Persistent PaO2 / FiO2 less than 150, b) persistent fever, c) increase in D-dimer at least 50% of the baseline and / or ferritin greater than 1000, after 48 hrs hospital stay receiving the standard management measures used at that time in the care center.\nLymphopenia less than 800 total lymphocytes\nIncreased D-dimer (> 1200 mg / dl)\nCT compatible with bilateral pneumonia\nSOFA under 11 With knowledge of the patient and / or their responsible relatives that it is a rescue treatment, in an experimental phase.\n\nThe bank mesenchymal cells will be donated by the CBCells Bio Technology Laboratory, at no cost to the patient or INCMNSZ.\n\n1x106 x Kg of weight, diluted in 100 ml of saline, will be infused intravenously, to pass in 40 minutes. It will be monitored with monitors, Pao2 / Fio2, FC, FR, ECG. Additionally, fever and muscle contractures will be monitored, which will be recorded every hour for 24 hours and every 24 hours thereafter, up to three weeks after the application of MSC. The patient should continue with their indicated medical treatments, such as antibiotics and specific treatments in case of comorbidities.\n\nThe results will be compared with the historical controls attended at INCMNSZ Thus, the results obtained will give information to calculate the sample size in subsequent studies in which the usefulness of the procedure will be evaluated."

Although bisphosphonates have been found to reduce osteoporosis, clinical use for these drugs has been limited because of its potential to produce serious side effects, such as mandibular osteonecrosis and atypical femoral fractures. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis are needed.\n\nThis study will assess the effectiveness of the allogeneic mesenchymal cell from umbilical cord. Patients who have received mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSC) are expected to have positive effects such as reduced pain sensation in the back assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), improvement in the range of motion (ROM), improving the quality of osteoporosis patients's bone proven by the results of Bone Mass Density (BMD) and improvement in patients' quality of life."

                              "Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional outcomes and quality of life.1 2 While less than 30% of patients experience short-term postoperative morbidity following IPAA,3-5 up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations.1,2,6-8 Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.1\n\nGiven the high safety profile, and relative success in treating perianal disease, we sought to use a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients with ileal anal anastomosis and ileal pouch fistulas. This trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Subjects who are refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Subjects enrolled will be those that meet current indications."

In the first phase, 10 patients will be included and randomized to 2 groups (5 Treatment arm; 5 Control Arm) and receive 2 x10^6 cells/kg MSCs on days 1 and 7 in addition to standard care. Thereafter, the trial committee will meet and evaluate all collected safety and efficacy information to decide about crossover of Control arm to treatment arm if patient deteriorates clinically while in Control arm. Then, 10 new subjects will be included in the study and treated according to protocol.\n\nPreparation of MSCs doses MSCs will be isolated from bone marrow harvested cells. About 50ml bone marrow will be collected from iliac crest using aseptic technique in syringes primed with anticoagulant. The collected sample will be diluted with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and MSCs will be separated using density gradient centrifugation. After resuspension the cells will be seeded at a fixed concentration of 100,000 cells/cm2 in specially designed flasks and incubated at 37oC in 5% carbondioxide (CO2). Medium will be changed after every third day till harvesting of MSCs from the flasks. Once confluent (approximately day 20) the cells will be harvested with sterile techniques using Trypsin- Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) solution. The prepared cells can either be stored in 50ml cryogenic vials for future use or infused immediately.\n\nPatient Selection and MSCs demand Patient for MSCs and Control arm will be selected by multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprising Critical Care Specialist, Pulmonologist, Infectious Disease Specialist, Clinical Hematologist.\n\nDemand for MSCs will be initiated on pre-designated forms , signed by Critical care Specialist Clearly indicating indication of MSCs.\nRequest form will be sent Stem Cell Lab.\nIncharge stem Cell Lab will authorize issuance of the MSCs dose.\nStem Cell Lab will issue the dose Administration of MSCs\n\n1. Experimental arm: Frozen MSCs will be resuspended in 100ml normal saline for immediate use and given intravenously. The patients should be pre-medicated to avoid allergic reactions to third party MSCs. Each patient in Experimental arm will be given 2 x 106 cells/kg will be administered on day 1,7 in addition to supportive care 2. Control Arm: Will be Continued on supportive care\n\nProposed usage:\n\nBecause of the very limited availability of MSCs, their usage has to be rationalized by MDT comprising of pulmonologist, critical care specialist and clinical haematologist and Infectious disease specialist.There is not enough evidence to put forth therapeutic recommendations however, treatment decisions can be made on case to case basis after MDT."

                              "In this study, investigators aimed to transplant autologous, adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells to the patients with liver cirrhosis. Investigators also aimed to assess liver tissue regeneration, downgrade of clinical findings and antiviral efficacy. Finally investigators aimed to establish an alternative treatment modality to liver transplantation.\n\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) which can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important health problem especially in western countries. In 5% - 25 of patients with chronic HCV hepatitis who are nonresponders to current medical treatment, liver cirrhosis develops. Approximately 1/3 of patients with liver cirrhosis become decompensate in 10 years. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C, However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Some very recent studies emphasize the antiviral effects of MSCs. The reasons for choosing this study title is; no available medical treatment for the non-responder cirrhotic patients, shortage of organ donors, patients rapidly progressing to transplantation candidates, and patients dying while they are in waiting lists and finally hopeful data regarding MSC applications. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies.\n\nIn this study autologous adipose tissue derived MSCs will be transplanted to patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C. After invitro expansion, patients will receive 1 million cells per kg. via peripheral vein every week for 3 times. Also via hepatic artery, 3 million cells per kg will be infused for 3 times in every 2 weeks. With this protocol, investigators aimed to increase liver regeneration, decrease in liver fibrosis, increase the waiting time of patients in transplantation lists and finally to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by pathology examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations."

After thoroughly recording the case history. The following investigations will be done prior to implant placement surgery: CBCT, CBP, CT, BT, Hg%, RBS, Vital signs and other relevant investigations. If all the parameters fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient's impressions are made and study models poured. Intraoral and extraoral photographs are taken. The surgical guide is constructed on the diagnostic models.Stem cells are carried from stem cell bank to the Department of Implantology in a cryovial, safely placed in the special device, which contains dry ice, to maintain the viability of stem cells.\n\nSurgical Procedure\n\nOn the day of surgery, the dental operatory is thoroughly fumigated and all the infection control protocols are followed.The participants will be receiving oral and written information about the study and shall be providing the informed consent along with photography and videography waiver consent. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (amoxicillin 1gm) and antihistamine prophylaxis (20mg cetirizine) orally 1 hour before surgery should be given to the patient. The universal precautions protocol is followed to protect yourself, the patients and the dental assistant.The patient is asked to rinse the Oral cavity with chlorhexidine gluconate solution (0.2%) for 1 minute before surgery.\n\nIMPLANT PLACEMENT ON THE CONTROL SIDE\n\nTo standardized the protocol the patient's right side is selected as the control side and left side as the test side. The surgical procedure is carried out under local anesthesia containing 2% epinephrine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The surgical guide is placed on the teeth and is used to mark the position of the implant with round drill till it hits the bone. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised with mid crestal incision and intrasulcular incision extending to one tooth mesially and other teeth distally. After full thickness flap elevation, the osteotomy sites are prepared using the drilling sequence instructed by the manufacturer.The dental implants Nobel Biocare Replace select (4.3 *10mm size) 4.3mm diameter and 10mm length is selected and placed in the osteotomy site with IF of 40 Ncm.Before approximation of the flap, the primary stability of the implant is recorded with the ostell device, which has a transducer attached to the device and a magnetic attachment smart peg is attached to the implant with a plastic peg holder each implant is measured twice from two different angles,around 90 degrees and parallel to the crestal line.The two measurements buccolingually and mesiodistally are recorded and an average of both the values are taken.The measurements values are then transferred into implant stability quotient (ISQ) units, which are given on a scale of 1- 100, with 100 being the highest degree of stability and it works on the principle of resonance frequency analysis (RFA).The smart peg is removed and Healing abutments are placed over the dental implants. The flap is sutured monofilament sutures 4-0. IOPAR are taken with KKD Radiograph system, which standardizes the distance between the collimator and the IOPAR.\n\nIMPLANT PLACEMENT ON THE TEST SIDE\n\nTo standardized the protocol the patient's left side is chosen as the test side.The surgical procedure is carried out under local anesthesia containing 2% epinephrine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The surgical guide is placed on the teeth and is used to mark the position of the implant with round drill till it hits the bone. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised with mid crestal incision and intrasulcular incision extending to one tooth mesially and another tooth distally. After full thickness flap elevation, the osteotomy sites are prepared using the drilling sequence instructed by the manufacturer. the stem cells are centrifuged in a sterile environment as per the instructions are given by the stem cell bank.(Thawing protocol )Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are primary cells which can be successfully used for infusion purpose.The following is the recommended protocol for thawing and infusion of these cells:Remove the Cryovial of stem cells from dry ice,defrost the vial containing stem cells by placing in between both the palms with constant, moderate agitation, until ice in the ampule is no longer visible,immediately disinfect the vial with 70% isopropanol.Working under laminar flow hood, open the vial and transfer the contents to a sterile 15ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3500 RPM for 5 minutes. Decant the supernatant and to the pellet add 1 ml of saline.Mix properly and the cells are ready for infusion at the osteotomy site. Remove the contents in a sterile dappen dish and before infusion of stem cells at the osteotomy site the implant is dipped in the solution for 3 minutes so that the stem cells adhere to the titanium implant surface. The same dental surgeon performs all the cases. The dental implants Nobel Biocare Replace select (4.3 *10mm size) 4.3mm diameter and 10mm length is selected and placed in the osteotomy site with IF of 40 Ncm11.Before approximation of the flap, the primary stability of the implant is recorded with the ostell device, which has a transducer attached to the device and a magnetic attachment smart peg is attached to the implant with a plastic peg holder each implant is measured twice from two different angles,around 90 degrees and parallel to the crestal line.The two measurements buccolingually and mesiodistally are recorded and an average of both the values are taken.The measurements values are then transferred into implant stability quotient (ISQ) units, which are given on a scale of 1- 100, with 100 being the highest degree of stability and it works on the principle of resonance frequency analysis (RFA).The smart peg is removed and Healing abutments are placed over the dental implants. The flap is sutured monofilament sutures 4-0.IOPAR are taken with KKD radiograph system, which standardizes the distance between the collimator and the IOPAR.\n\nPOST SURGICAL TREATMENT\n\nThe patient is advised to take soft diet for one week and not to spit and rinse for the next 24 hours. Antibiotics, Antihistamines, and NSAIDs must be continued for 3 days. Postoperative edema if any must be controlled with corticosteroids. The sutures are removed one week postoperatively.\n\nRecall visits\n\nWeekly recall of the patient for 12 weeks for evaluation and recording of implant stability measurements with Ostell ISQ device. Patient safety measures are evaluated on every visit like unusual pain, swelling, allergic reaction, inflammation, outgrowth, vital signs, blood assay or any unspecific reactions should be noted down. The emergency contact number is provided to the patient to report any abnormal incidence immediately. The prosthetic part of the treatment is to be carried out after 3 months either with removable or fixed rehabilitation.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics will be computed to summarize the data for its central tendency and dispersion. Two sample t-test will be applied to see the mean change in the outcome variable between experimental and control groups. Repeated measures of ANOVA are being applied to see the time changes between experimental and control groups. Where ever data is not following uniformity, either transforming the data or nonparametric statistical technique will be applied. The analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Version 19.0."

WHO reported 15-40/million people suffer from SCI each year, about 250,000 to 500,000 people. The majority of SCI victims are young patients, who are at the time of working age. As a result of that, SCI not only affects the physical and psychological health of those patients, but also bring huge economic burden to their families, as well as the society. The current treatments for SCI mainly include surgical operation, neuroregenerative medicine, physical therapy, chinese acupuncture and so on. However, none of these methods are efficient enough to make any functional recovery of neurological injury in patients, and most patients will have to face paraplegia or tetraplegia.\n\nThe most challenge of SCI treatment are reported to be regeneration of axon and rewiring of the damaged spinal cord. The properties of strong proliferation and differentiation make stem cell transplantation possible to replace the damage axon and rebridge the injury spinal cord. Currently, evidences from animal experiments and pilot clinical studies have reported that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation was a potential method to treat spinal cord injury, but its safety and efficacy remain controversial.\n\nThis study will conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of different phrases of SCI, including sub-acute, early stage, and late stage of chronic SCI. These three trials will investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal transplantation of UC-MSC in patients with SCI treatment. The study will be conducted at 3 hospitals in China, covering eastern, southern and western of Chinese mainland.\n\nThe primary outcome is the changes of motor and sensory assessment before and after intervention using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Score Scale. Secondary outcomes will include International Association of Neural Restoration Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIRFS), electromyogram test, residual urine test and adverse events.\n\nThe enrolled participants will be followed up at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation. Besides, the samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected, before and after treatment, to explore the potential mechanism of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of SCI.\n\nThe results of this study will, for the first time, provide high level of evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

                              "The main goal of this phase 1 clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of an autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) application as therapy for drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy in a one-center study. It is well known that drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy is a dramatically invalidating disorder for which applied stationary and outpatient therapies have no real clinical effect. Therefore new approaches are needed to reach remission, to stop disease progression, and to increase patient quality of life. For this study, adult (18-60 years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included into study. Drug-resistance was defined by a lack of any evident clinical response (i.e., no decrease in seizure frequency or reduction in disease progression) of the pts with symptomatic epilepsy to carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, lamotrigine, or phenobarbital (i.e., anti-epileptic drugs[AEDs]) as monotherapies and in different combinations over the previous one calendar year. The criteria for exclusion were patient refusal to participate, unfavorable reactions to therapy, CNS inflammatory conditions, chronic psychoses, CNS tumors, relapses of chronic somatic or neurologic diseases, and blood positivity for hepatitis B or C or HIV. The plan included the inclusion of 30 pts in the study group and 30 pts in the control group over a period of 5 years. The pts were randomized to standard treatment with AEDs (control group) or AEDs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, study group). The MSCs were obtained from bone marrow samples of the same patient and were purified and expanded ex vivo in a specialized cellular biotechnology laboratory. The MSCs were characterized by immunophenotyping as CD90+CD105 +CD45-CD34-cells. After 3 weeks of cultivation in vitro, a portion of the MSC were additionally cultured for 7 days in Neurocult-XF proliferation medium to obtain neuroinduced MSCs. Neuroinduction was proved by the presence of the genetic markers nestin and neuron-specific enolase. Finally, 40-101 x 106 autologous cultured MSCs and 2.7 - 8.0 x 106 autologous neuroinduced MSCs were harvested, resuspended in saline solution containing 5% autologous blood serum for injection, and, following a measurement of the viability (98% cells), transferred to the clinical center.\n\nThe pts in the study group received one slowly delivered (over 5-10 minutes) intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded autologous MSCs in a volume of 20 ml, and 5-7 days later, each patient in the study group received an additional slowly delivered endolumbal injection of the neuroinduced MSCs in a volume of 5 ml. Both unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections (over one day following the performance of the procedures) and the early (up to one month) and late (up to 6 months) clinical effects, including complications, were evaluated. Unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS, i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia). Later potential unfavorable systemic reactions of the CNS and vascular system, including infectious and noninfectious complications of the progression of the disease to be controlled, were examined. All of the events were documented in medical cards. In cases in which these events exhibited dangerous characteristics, they were declared to members of the monitoring board (the center's ethical committee) for the evaluation of the exclusion of the patients from the study or the termination of the clinical study.\n\nAlso evaluated were the possible beneficial effects of MSC-based therapy in the pts of the study group. These effects were detected via clinical observations at selected therapy time points (i.e., 3 and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy) and electroencephalography measurements prior to and one year after the therapy. To determine the possible changes in disease progression, signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated. For the evaluation of cognitive impairment, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination. The handicapping effect of disease on daily life was scoring using the Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy Scale. State anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital anxiety and depression scale . Changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The processes of voluntary attention and performance were studied with Schulte tables according to the methods of Kraepelin. Schulte tables were used to study sensorimotor reaction times and the distribution and stability of attention. The \"Account of Kraepelin\" method was used to study health, fatigue and the stability of attention. The assessment of short-term memory was performed via the method of memorizing 10 words; this method aims to determine the volume and speed of oral-aural memory.\n\nMain clinical characteristics that are used for disease monitoring were \"yes\" or \"no\" responses (regarding therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease at the early (3 months) and late (12 month and more) time points after therapy. To evaluate partial responses to therapy, the numbers of pts who exhibited 50% reductions in seizure frequency were assessed. Seizure type (i.e., generalized tonic-clonic, partial complex, simple partial, and multiple types of seizures) was also evaluated along with changes in seizure type during the treatment course.\n\nElectroencephalography recordings were performed at admission and across the monitoring period using a Mizar EEG 201 encephalography system with biopotential registration from 16 body points according to the \"10-20\" scheme. The observed electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves were analyzed in 3-min segments (with further recalculation for each 1-minute segment) prior to (at admission) and 1 year after MSC application. The peak frequency of the alpha waves was also calculated. Both the spontaneous state and the state after the loading probe (hyperventilation and photostimulation) were evaluated for each patient. The characteristics of the electroencephalographies (EEG) were attributed to local and diffuse cortical alterations. We evaluated the paroxysmality index, quantities of local and generalized spikes of epileptiform waves per minute, peak frequency of EEG activity, index of slow activity, and summarized points of EEG pathology signs. EEGs with epileptiform activity included spikes, spike-slow waves, and high-amplitude spikes. The EEG recordings were performed based on standard and additionally proposed criteria . All of the assessments were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to determine the potential differences due to the additionally performed MSC-based therapy. A patient's therapy was terminated at any time point if immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The final observations of the patients included clinical and EEG assessments at 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy. The summarized data for the pts in the control and study groups were collected in an electronic database for further analysis and interpretations."

                              "MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow samples and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer. The MSCs used in this study were collected from healthy male donors and are stored in a laboratory at MD Anderson. The use of male cells will help us to detect the cells that are infused versus your own female cells.\n\nThe MSCs have been genetically changed in a laboratory at MD Anderson to add proteins called interferons. The MSCs will have genetic material introduced to them by a molecule called a plasmid that will help produce interferon beta. Interferons (IFNs) are proteins that may interfere with the growth of tumors. The MSCs will be grown in the laboratory and tested before they are given to you.\n\nMSC-INFb Dose Levels:\n\nIf you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of MSC-INFb based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of MSC-INFb will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of MSC-INFb is found.\n\nYour dose level may be lowered if you are not tolerating the MSC-INFb infusions. Your study doctor will discuss this with you.\n\nMSC-INFb Administration:\n\nAbout 1-2 weeks before your first MSC-INFb infusion, you will have an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter placed in your abdomen. A catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into your abdomen while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will receive a Patient Information Sheet that includes the definition of intraperitoneal therapy and information about the placement of the catheter and care of the catheter during the study. You will also be provided with a specific separate informed consent for the IP catheter placement by Interventional Radiology staff at MD Anderson.\n\nOne time a week for up to 4 weeks (up to 4 times total), you will receive the MSC-INFb infusions through the IP catheter. The length of time for the infusion will depend on the size of the tumor.\n\nYou will remain in the clinic for about 30 minutes for observation after each MSC-INFb infusion.\n\nStudy Tests:\n\nAbout 1 week before your first MSC-INFb infusion:\n\nYou will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).\nYour medical history will be recorded.\nBlood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your kidney and liver function, to check the status of the disease, and for INFb testing for comparison purposes. Blood tests may be repeated more frequently during the study if your doctor thinks it is needed.\nYou will complete a symptom questionnaire. It should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.\n\nAbout 1-2 weeks before your first MSC-INFb infusion, during the same procedure as the IP catheter placement, you will have a tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease. To collect a tumor biopsy, the affected area is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of tissue is withdrawn with a large needle. A day or two before your tumor biopsy, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test clotting factors in your blood.\n\nOnce a week for 4 weeks, before each MSC-INFb infusion:\n\nYou will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\nBlood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your kidney and liver function, to check the status of the disease and response to the infusion. \u00b0Blood tests may be repeated more frequently during the study if your doctor thinks it is needed.\nIf you can become pregnant, you will have a blood or urine pregnancy test. If blood, it will be included in the routine blood draw listed above.\nBefore the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd MSC-INFb infusion, you will complete a symptom questionnaire. It should take about 10-15 minutes each time to complete.\nBefore each MSC-INFb infusion, up to 2 teaspoons of peritoneal fluid (if present) will be drawn through the catheter and stored in a laboratory at MD Anderson for future research related to this study.\n\nBefore your peritoneal fluid can be used for research, the researchers must get approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee of doctors, researchers, and community members. The IRB is responsible for protecting study participants and making sure all research is safe and ethical.\n\nYour samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the samples to be updated as needed.\n\nAbout 22-26 days after your last MSC-INFb infusion:\n\nBlood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test clotting factors in your blood.\nYou will have a tumor biopsy and the IP catheter will be removed. The tumor biopsy will be tested to determine if the MSC-INFb infusions had any effect on the tumor.\nYou will have CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease. This may be repeated every 2 months for up to 12 months starting about 22-26 days after the last MSC-INFb infusion, if you doctor thinks it is needed.\n\nFollow-Up Visits:\n\nAbout 1 week after the last MSC-INFb infusion:\n\nYou will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\nBlood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn about 1 week after the last MSC-INFb infusion for routine tests, to check your kidney and liver function, and to check the status of the disease and the response to the infusion. If your doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn at 44 days after the last MSC-INFb infusion and then once a month for 2 months to check the response to the infusions.\nYou will complete a symptom questionnaire. It should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou will be taken off study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or your study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\nLong-Term Follow-Up:\n\nFor safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that patients who receive infusions of stem cells treated with a gene transfer procedure must be followed have long-term follow-up for at least up to 15 years after receiving the gene transfer.\n\nOnce a year for Years 1-5 after the last MSC-INFb infusion:\n\nBlood (about 2-4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests.\nYou will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\nYou will complete a questionnaire that asks about your medical history (your general health, the status of any medical conditions, and any illnesses or hospitalizations that may have occurred). It should take about 15-30 minutes to complete.\nYou will be asked if there have been any changes in your contact information.\nIf necessary to check the status of the disease, you will have computed tomography (CT) scans and/or additional routine blood tests (about 1-2 tablespoons).\n\nOnce a year during Years 6-15 after the last MSC-INFb infusion, the research staff will contact you. Either over the phone, by email, or mail, you will fill out a questionnaire that asks about your medical history (your general health, the status of any medical conditions, and any illnesses or hospitalizations that may have occurred). The phone calls and questionnaires should take about 15-30 minutes each time."

Because some patients with articular cartilage defects may progress to osteoarthritis, such defects need to be repaired even though their exact natural course remains obscure. Traditional methods for repair, such as micro fracture, perforations, abrasion arthroplasty, have not produced consistent satisfactory long term clinical results. Transplantation of autologous bone marrow MSCs expanded in culture would be a promising approach in the repair of articular cartilage defects in human osteoarthritic knees. This method is clinically straightforward to perform because autologous cells can be readily harvested and expanded in culture without losing their capacity to differentiate into chondrocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results obtained with autologous MSCs expanded in culture for the treatment of full-thickness chondral defects in human knee."

                              "Dry eye disease (DED) is a very common problem seen in patients all over the world. According to an older study the prevalence of DED in a Danish population 30-60 years of age was 11%. Aqueous tear deficient dry eye (ADDE) is a subtype of DED in which the tear production in the lacrimal gland (LG) is impaired. Current treatment of ADDE is only to relieve symptoms as a curative treatment of ADDE does not exist.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in almost all connective tissues and are multipotent stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into several kinds of tissue. Several studies have shown that MSCs reduces inflammation in various diseases. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) have gained considerable attention, since they are readily available from the abdominal fat where it is most easily collected and expanded. In resting MSCs, MHC class II is not expressed on the surface, which reduces the inherent immunogenicity of the cells. This supreme attribute allows allogeneic MSC transplantation. Treatment with allogeneic MSCs have been investigated in an extensive number of human subjects for various conditions in clinical trials and no documented adverse events related to an anti-donor immune response exist. One potential advantage of treatment with allogeneic cells is the possibility of their use as an \"off-the-shelf\" therapeutic agent, avoiding the need for tissue collection and culture to delay and increase the cost of treatment. It has also been suggested that the function of autologous MSCs could be impaired in patients with comorbidities or advanced age.\n\nIn canines as in humans the most common cause of ADDE is an immune-mediated inflammatory response targeting the LG. Two studies with injection of allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors in a total of 48 eyes in 27 canines with ADDE have been performed with a significant increase in tear production and no observed adverse events to the treatment.\n\nStudies with injection of ASCs into the human LG has never been conducted. This present study will test the hypothesis that injection of allogeneic ASCs into the LG in patients suffering from ADDE is safe and increases tear production and reduces inflammation resulting in increased ocular comfort.\n\n7 patients with severe ADDE from Dept. of Ophthalmology, Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, will be recruited if they are 1: eligible for the study and 2: sign the informed consent form.\n\nAt inclusion the participants will fill out the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and undergo an eye examination in the following order:\n\nmeasurement of tear osmolarity (TearLab\u2122), tear break-up time (TBUT), ocular surface staining according to the Ocular SICCA Grading Score, and Schirmer's I test.\n\nAfter a maximum of 14 days from screening all participants will receive an injection with ASCs into the lacrimal gland on one eye. If both eyes fulfill the eligibility criteria the most affected eye with the lowest tear production assessed with the Schirmer's I test will be the study eye; the contralateral eye will not be treated but examined according to the same protocol as the study eye at each follow-up.\n\nThe product used is CSCC_ASC(22) and the dose injected contains approximately 11 million ASCs per LG in a suspension with a total volume of 0.5 ml.\n\n1 week (\u00b12 days), 4 weeks (\u00b14 days), and 4 months (\u00b17 days) after intervention the participants are followed up with eye examination as described above, OSDI questionnaire, and blood test. At 4 months the primary outcomes of safety will be evaluated.\n\nEnd of trial is defined as last participant's last visit (LPLV) at 3 years late follow-up."

                              "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, rapidly progressive, and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying treatment. Recent insights into pathophysiologic mechanisms suggest a crucial role of deprivation of neurotrophic factors which have been shown to be secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In a recent phase I/II study adipose-derived autologous MSCs were delivered intrathecally to patients with early MSA utilizing a dose-escalation design. At a dose of 50 million MSCs, injections were generally well tolerated, but thickening of cauda equina nerve roots was observed which was either asymptomatic or associated with low back pain. The rate of disease progression assessed using the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) was markedly slower compared to a matched control group. An even more favorable side effect profile and virtually lack of disease progression was seen in an add-on cohort receiving 25 million MSCs per injection. Neurofilament light chain, an index of central axonal degeneration, decreased in all patients receiving that dose. MSC administrations resulted in a marked, dose-dependent increase of neurotrophic factors in CSF. 2-year survival was significantly higher than observed in natural history cohorts.\n\nBased on these findings we are now conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design phase II trial of adipose-derived intrathecal autologous MSCs in MSA with the goal to establish optimal treatment frequency and simultaneously derive placebo-controlled efficacy and safety data in preparation for a multicenter phase III trial. Up to 76 adult subjects with MSA will be enrolled. To ensure a homogenous patient population with comparable rates of disease progression, we will restrict the study to early cases but still fulfilling strictest diagnostic consensus criteria. Participants will undergo a subcutaneous fat biopsy to derive autologous MSCs, which are cultured, expanded, and prepared for delivery in Mayo's Cell Therapeutics Lab. In a first phase, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 25 million MSCs at two different injection intervals (every 6 months or every 3 months) as the two active arms or lactated Ringer's solution as the placebo arm. A recruitment hold after half the subjects have been enrolled will allow for an interim futility and efficacy analysis to select the \"winner\" active treatment assuming futility criteria are not met. The study will then restart recruiting the second half of subjects utilizing 2:1 randomization (\"winner\" active: placebo). Patients undergo clinical assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to derive the primary endpoint, the rate of disease progression assessed using UMSARS total and a mixed effects regression model. MRI of the head and lumbar spine will be completed at baseline and 12 months to expand safety data and to assess the rate of atrophy of selected brain regions using morphometric measures as surrogate markers of disease progression. Spinal fluid before and after administrations, as well as stem cell product media will be collected to further explore biological properties and effects of MSCs and to explore selected spinal fluid markers as biomarkers of disease progression."

                              "Introduction\n\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common and devastating injury among young athletes, and re-injury poses significant threats to both successful return to play and long term outcomes. Graft healing during ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a slow biologic process, that involves graft incorporation into bone tunnel sites, as well as intra-articular graft remodeling . The intra-articular graft remodeling process is known as ligamentization, and occurs in three phases after ACLR. The first phase of early healing occurs between 0 and three months, the second phase occurs between 6 months and one year, and the final phase of maturation occurs after 1 year when the graft appears very similar to the native ACL. The studies that defined these time points biopsied human bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) ACL autografts at different postoperative points, and described changes occurring over time in regards to vascularization, cellular aspects, and appearance of the extracellular matrix in comparison to control ACLs . Unlike animal models which display a necrotic stage, grafts in human models undergo an early vascular invasion, associated with fibroblasts that are converted to a hyper-cellular matrix with only focalized areas of necrosis . This process occurs as early as 3 weeks postoperatively, and increases over time as areas similar to the native patellar tendon with mature collagen and metabolically quiescent cells decrease . This process is the limiting factor in graft healing for bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) grafts, as osteointegration occurs earlier .\n\nThe processes of osteointegration and ligamentization are responses to the new intrasynovial milieu and physical forces that the new graft is exposed to. During these healing and restructuring processes, failure load and stiffness of grafts decreases by up to 24% at 7 weeks, before strengthening to their potential . This contributes to the long recovery period for ACLR, and the risk of re-rupture during this period. Advances in biologic adjuncts to accelerate and improve this healing process would have a significant impact on the management of ACL injuries.\n\nRecently, biologic preparations of various growth factors have been developed to safely and effectively treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including tendinopathies and arthritis . Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) consists of undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells that are concentrated and applied to the injury site . Previous studies have demonstrated this treatment to offer the pluripotent potential of the cells to impact healing, regeneration, biomechanical strength, and reducing bone-tunnel enlargement . Investigators have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell reinforced grafts had a significantly higher failure load and stiffness as early as 8 week post-operation in a rabbit model, suggesting an added benefit of advanced healing . Using BMSCs can offer a novel method to enhance tendon graft osteointegration. While there have been numerous laboratory studies researching the effect of mesenchymal stem cells, there lacks evidence in translation to the clinical setting. Silva et al performed a study where they injected bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) into patellar tendon grafts to examine for increased graft-to-bone tunnel integration. They did not find a significant difference of tunnel integration on MRI imaging, but they did not examine the intra-articular portions for the effect on the ligamentization process, nor did they examine the effect on clinical examination and patient reported outcomes .\n\nQuantitative MRI is a non-invasive method to interrogate tissue properties and evaluate the biochemical composition of tissues. The T2* sequence gives information regarding tissue graft volume, water content, fiber alignment, and tissue density. Median grayscale values (a measure to determine tissue quality)can also be correlated to maximum failure load, yield load, and linear stiffness of grafts in a porcine model. Increases in MRI signals in ACL grafts have been found to be time dependent, becoming well established by three months, particularly at the distal intra-articular portion near the tibial tunnel . These changes have not been shown previously to be predictive of graft failure, but Investigators have recently also confirmed that normalized T2* signal intensity values of ACL grafts have significant correlation with knee instability related to ligamentization and tunnel healing.\n\nA recent study examined intra-articular graft maturation after platelet-rich plasma gel (PRPG) application, with MRI at month intervals from 3-12 months postoperatively. The intra-articular segment was divided in a proximal, middle, and distal segment, on a scale from 0-3 ranging from completely homogenous to severely heterogeneous. The mean time to obtain completely homogenous bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) graft was 109 days for the PRPG group, and 363 for the control group 8.\n\nWe propose using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T2* mapping to investigate if BMAC treatment at time of ACL reconstruction can accelerate the graft maturation and healing process. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft evaluating the T2* weighted MRI changes of the graft at 3 and 9 months after surgical reconstruction. Additionally, we will obtain patient-reported outcome measures from this cohort to evaluate if BMAC treatment imparts a clinically-significant effect on ACL reconstruction.\n\nStudy Rationale\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of biologic augmentation of ACL reconstruction with BMSCs as measured by magnetic resonance imaging to detect graft healing and integration. Secondary endpoints will include validated patient reported outcome measures, as well as functional outcome using objective examination findings.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe hypotheses of this study are that there will be improved graft healing and integration at three and nine months as measured by decreased signal intensity and heterogeneity on T2* MRI following administration of BMAC during ACL reconstruction compared to the control group. Additionally, patient reported outcomes and physical examination findings will be significantly improved at an earlier time in those who receive the BMAC treatment to their allograft compared to the control group.\n\nStudy Plan\n\nThis study will be a prospective randomized trial of patients undergoing arthroscopic reconstruction of full thickness anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. All patients who sign consent and undergo full thickness ACL reconstruction will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment will continue until 32 patients, 16 in each group, are enrolled. Follow-up will take place at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 24 months."

Although arthroscopic repair leads to satisfactory clinical results, the retear rates varies from 4 to 94%. The main cause of failure after rotator cuff repair is not related to the material used, but to the tissue deficiency and the healing process between the tendon and the bone. After the intervention, the rotator cuff does not restore its original histological characteristics and its fixation occurs through scar tissue with lower biomechanical resistance. There are few clinical studies on the use of mesenchymal cells in rotator cuff repair,, with good results.\n\nThe investigators will perform a randomized clinical study involving 44 patients, evaluating the effect of mesenchymal cells on rotator cuff repair. The primary outcome will be post-operative MRI tendon integrity and secondary outcomes clinical assessment by the UCLA and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scales and pain by visual analog scale (VAS)."

                              "A Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a treatment in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by COVID-19 is a pilot phase, open label, non-randomized study, with a single study center.\n\nThe current pandemic caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a health care crisis affecting hospitals, hospital workers and health care structure globally. Many countries are dealing with a disrupted infrastructure in health care and imminent economic downfall to an extent that has not been seen in recent years. COVID-19 has lead to a large number of deaths in several countries, and Mexico has not been an exception. Availability of supplies, hospital space and equipment for mechanical ventilation are running critically low, and it has been a challenge for hospitals coping with severe clinical symptoms in COVID-19. This disease is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough and occasional diarrhea, and the severity has been largely attributed to the high affinity of the virus to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main receptor, and the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease TMPRSS2 as the main host protease that mediates S protein activation on primary target cells in the lung and small intestine.\n\nMany agencies and professional societies are working worldwide in developing treatment guidelines to care for patients with COVID-19, since the present treatments are supportive but not yet curative, therefore these guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion, the use of an array of drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents that are being studied. Lately, Remdesivir, a novel small-molecule adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys has shown improvement in patients with oxygen support. The focus of the research for a cure of COVID-19 has been centered on the individual's response in an immunological context, where an over activation of the immune response can cause a production of a large quantity of inflammatory molecules resulting in a cytokine storm with severe physiological consequences. The cytokine storm induces an increase in inflammatory proteins that results in edema, improper oxygen exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other organ damage and secondary infection. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have proven to decrease the hyper inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to a steady recovery in patients with ARDS. The use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) may prove a potential effective measure for the treatment of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19.\n\nA step forward in a treatment strategy for the novel virus infection in humans would be critical for treating COVID-19 and especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently depleting resources around the world. Because efforts to control lung injury via pharmacological agents have been unsuccessful, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is being investigated, based on the characteristics of MSCs to self-renew in a limitless manner and their multipotency.\n\nFurthermore, MSC-based therapies have demonstrated in the past of having sufficient promising effects in experimental treatment of ARDS via inhibition of alveolar collapse, collagen accumulation, and cell apoptosis in lung tissue. Recent studies found that administrating allogeneic MSCs in patients with ARDS resulted in no pre-specified adverse events, including hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia. MSCs are currently attracting interest due to source potential, a high proliferation rate, and a painless procedure that is free of ethical issues. Selection of a starting dose of approximately 100 million cells has been chosen to approximate the standard dosage of cells employed in prior clinical studies. This dosage may be adjusted depending on the data generated during the conduction of the study.\n\nMSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are triggered further by the activation of TLR receptor in MSCs, which is stimulated by pathogen-associated molecules such as LPS or double-stranded RNA from virus, like the HCoV-19.\n\nThere are many pilot studies conducted with MSC transplantation to explore their therapeutic potential for HCoV-19 infected patients, in many of them the pulmonary function and symptoms of patients were significantly improved days after MSC transplantation. Thus, in this study we intend to prove the intravenous transplantation of MSCs as safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for patients in severe condition.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the feasibility and safety of intravenously administered MSCs in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess preliminary response in respiratory performance in patients with ARDS.\n\nTo assess overall survival of patients. To determine mortality rate at 14 days post treatment. To assess clinical and radiological improvements in patients.\n\nNumber of Subjects to be studied: 10\n\nEndpoints\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nEvaluate Respiratory distress symptoms based on Berlin definition (RR; Oxygen saturation at rest; Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / Fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2)).\n\nDetermine the degree of ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration in imaging studies (X-ray or CT).\n\nEvaluate clinical improvement based on APACHE II Score. Determine mortality rate at 2 weeks post treatment.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nAdverse events related to MSC infusion (description, timing, grade, seriousness, and relatedness) Hematological decompensation (based on CBC, SQ and metabolic panels) Objective response rate Progression free survival, overall survival, and best overall response rate Determine if any infusion reactions/toxicity occurs\n\nClinical and radiological parameters will be assessed at Baseline, 2, 4 and 14 day post-treatment, and there will be a 3 month follow-up by telephone contact."

                              "Chronic inappropriate mucosal immune activation, due to aberrant host interactions with intestinal microbiota, is at the heart of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. Currently, there is no cure for IBD and mainstays of therapy are limited to non-cell specific immunosuppression/immunomodulation, antibiotics and surgery. Advanced ulcerative colitis patients cost approximately 10,000JD in therapy per year with 12.4% of patients presenting with rectal bleeding in Jordan being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The role of MSCs in immune modulation is well established in many diseases. However, the therapeutic potential of MSCs directly injected into the inflamed large intestine or parentally has not been fully investigated. Injected MSCs may modulate the IBD immune response particularly lymphoid T-cell and neutrophil activities. While a variety of immune cells contribute to the disease, increased neutrophil activity is associated with greater frequency and severity of active inflammation, as well as increased colitis associated cancer risk. MPOx can transform lipids and polyamines into reactive carbonyl species (RCS) capable of modifying proteins and DNA, altering cell signalling pathways. Finally, MPOx is reported as a useful tool in screening and risk stratification of human ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. Inhibiting MPOx in an accelerated preclinical mouse model did reduce incidence and tumor load resulting from gut inflammation. Additionally, in similar preclinical models others have reported that MSC transplantation reduces colitis severity and inflammatory markers including MPOx activity. Even in the absence of the well-known MSC T-cell immune modulation, disease activity indices and MPOx activity were reduced in these models. In addition to following traditional clinical outcomes, Reseachers will analyze gut immune responses, specifically neutrophil MPOx activity along with other IBD immune markers."

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease and often leads to lifelong disability, muscle spasm, sensory deficits, autonomic disturbances, as well as bowel and bladder incontinence, all of which can cause tremendous troubles to patients but are lack of any effective treatment up to now. SCI is not only a severe healthy problem but also a great social burden. To the best of our knowledge, cell therapy seems to be a promising alternative for the treatment of SCI due to numerous advantages. However, cytotherapy is still in its infancy since there are many disparities and uncertainties regarding subject selection, cellular type, transplantation timing, administration dose and deliver route in clinical trial protocols. Hence, a standardized well-designed clinical study is urgently required for the safe and effective treatment of SCI.\n\nIn this study, complete or incomplete cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar SCI subjects were recruited to join in a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial. Intervention is four times of subarachnoid administration of allogeneic hUC-MSCs. During the intervention and follow-up periods of this trial, any adverse event was identified rapidly and managed properly. The maximum intensity and relationship of any adverse event with hUC-MSCs administration were identified.The primary efficacy indicator is American spinal injury association (ASIA) total score at the fourth follow-up and SCI Functional Rating Scale of the International Association of Neurorestoratology (IANR-SCIFRS) total score at the fourth follow-up. Secondary efficacy indicators are these two indicators at the remaining time points, scores of pin prick, light touch, motor and sphincter, muscle spasticity and spasm, autonomic system, bladder and bowel functions, residual urine volume. Subgroup analysis of primary efficacy indicators was also performed.\n\nIn this trial, informed consent forms that had the approval of the institutional review board were obtained from all participants before recruitment. In this clinical study, subarachnoid transplantation of hUC-MSCs was performed a total of four times per subject with the delivery dose of 1\u00d710E6 cells/kg. After the completion of cytotherapy, subject was regularly followed up in the hospital at four time points, determined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the final administration of hUC-MSCs. At each time point of administration (the first, second, third, and fourth transplantation) and follow-up (the first, second, third, and fourth follow-up), safety and efficacy indicators were collected accordingly by two independent assessors."

Half of the patients undergoing a HLA-identical allografts who survive beyond 100 days may require long-term immunosuppressive treatment for extensive chronic GVHD, often for more than 2 years. More than one-third of patients with chronic GVHD do not respond to first-line therapy, which often involves combinations of corticosteroids and a calcineurin inhibitor. There is no standard second-line or salvage therapy for these patients and they have a poor outcome.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that can differentiate into various lineages and have been used to repair injured tissues. Recently, MSCs have also shown unique immunomodulatory properties ex-vivo, including inhibition of T-cell proliferation after stimulation by allo-antigens and mitogens, and prevention of the activity of cytotoxic T cells.MSCs have been used for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD and for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD,but rarely have been used for extensive chronic GVHD.\n\nDevelopment of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with extensive chronic GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.\n\nIn this study, a single center randomized, non blinded Phase II clinical trial is proposed to study the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of extensive chronic GVHD newly or refractory to the usual therapeutic measures.\n\nExpanded MSC will be infused at a dose of 2 million cells/kg twice a week for 2 weeks and weekly for the following two weeks (six doses totally)in patients based first-line therapy (steroid plus cyclosporin A ) or their primary immunosuppressive therapies."

Regenerative medicine, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation, has developed extensively, with preclinical and clinical trials emphasizing the benefits of stem cell therapy for restoration of sexual deficiency. n our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency. In phase II, 40 males with hormone deficiency will be recruited and divided randomly into two groups (n=23 each). The group A will receive UC-MSCs intravenously at day 0 and day 90 \u00b1 7, while the group B will be infused with UC-MSCs at day 180 \u00b1 14 and day 270 \u00b1 14. Each group will be monitored for 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion. The phase II is to investigate safety and efficacy of UC-MSC infusion for the treatment of sexual hormone deficiency in males.\n\nThe primary outcome are: (1) numbers of AEs or SAEs during UC-MSC infusion and 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion; (2) Testosterone levels and sexual life quality through quantification of Aging Men Symptom (AMS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQoL-M) at day 90 \u00b1 7 and day 180 \u00b1 14 of the group A compared to those of the group B.\n\nThe secondary outcome are: (1) Testosterone levels and (2) sexual life quality through quantification of AMS, IIEF, and SQoL-M at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion of each group compared to the baseline; (3) cytokine concentration (TNFa, IFN-\u03b3, IL1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, IDO) in serum of the participants and their T cell immunophenotype at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from adult tissues. These are characterized in vitro by their extensive proliferative ability in an uncommitted state while retaining the potential to differentiate along various lineages of mesenchymal origin, including chondrocyte, osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages, in response to appropriate stimuli.MSCs can be induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Centeno et al.in 2008 reported about the beneficial effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis of knee. The regenerative effects of MSCs in osteoarthritis can be due to their ability to differentiate themselves into chondrocytes and structurally repair the articular cartilage. Recently, MSCs have been shown to possess many potent paracrine effects through secretion of various soluble factors which can influence the local tissue environment and exert protective effects with an end result of effectively stimulating regeneration in situ. Recently Amgad etal.in their study reported even more effective results with use of platelet rich plasma along with mesenchymal stem cells. Platelets play an instrumental role in the normal healing response via the localsecretion of growth factors and recruitment of reparative cells. Its use in orthopaedic began early in this decade as PRP was used with bone grafts to augment spinal fusion and fracture healing.\n\nWakitani et al. in 1994 described repair of defects in articular cartilage in rabbits.Murphy et al.studied the effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in caprine knee joints.Quarto et al.reported the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to repair a large musculoskeletal defect with successful healing of a large bone defect in three patients. Centeno et al. reported one case in which they showed that isolated and expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells when percutaneously injected into a knee with symptomatic and radiographic osteoarthritis, resulted in significant cartilage growth, decreased pain and increased joint mobility. Mishra et al. reported that PRP could enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, and that TGFbeta and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which are factors present within PRP, were important for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs.Hence present study is designed to study the efficacy of use of PRP enhanced mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis knee.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of Platelet rich plasma enhanced autologous mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet rich plasma in knee osteoarthritis.\nTo correlate the clinical improvement with the radiological findings."

This situation has put health systems under extreme pressure, being overwhelmed be the amount of patients requiring attention.\n\nAround 5% of patients will require ICU internation, due to severe lung inflammation giving rise to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a cytokine storm that ultimately affects other organs. In this group, mortality can be as high as 40%.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have shown great immunomodulatory effects, and are used in other inflammatory conditions as autoimmune diseases, being safe and preliminary effective in improving patients health status. They exert their effect via paracrine and autocrine pathways and have been shown to reduce IL-1, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor alpha and increase IL-10 in COVID 19 patients. One of the greater advantages of the MSC is that they express no Major Histocompatibility Complex, reducing the risk of host immune reaction.\n\nGiven their immunomodulatory effects, research in this topic showing their safety and experimental efficacy are needed, as therapies for severe patients are lacking. Patients, researchers and data analysts will be blinded, and ARDS patients will be randomly allocated in standard therapy plus MSC arm or standard therapy alone to answer these questions."

                              "Liver cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands and causes by many forms of liver diseases and conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. Liver cirrhosis has become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality with over one million people died due to cirrhosis in 2010 worldwide. Currently, the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. However, the shortage in donor organ availability and the side-effect associated with long-term immunosuppression after transplant requires the development of new alternative therapies for liver cirrhosis. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) as well as umbilical cord-derive mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. In Vietnam, however, there are no clinical trials to date that investigate the potential of UC-MSCs for liver cirrhosis management. This is a phase I, open label, single arm trial using UC-MSCs to treat patients with liver cirrhosis that includes 20 patients. The primary outcome measure will be change in MELD score at 3, 6, and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation from baseline. The safety is assessed by frequency and severity of the adverse event or serious adverse event associated with stem cell injection. This study could reconfirm the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis and would open a novel cell therapy for the treatment of adult liver cirrhosis"

Isolation and culture (3 to 4 weeks in MEM-alpha medium) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were performed in accredited good manufacturing practices (GMP) clean room. A panel of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers including CD105, CD166, CD44, CD45, CD90, and CD34 were checked for making sure about differentiation of cells into MSCs after 3-4 weeks of cell culture. Viability of MSCs was checked by Trypan blue testing and all of the cultivations were negative for bacterial contamination. A single dose of 1000000 to 2000000 mesenchymal stem cells/kg infused into patients intravenously. To prevent anaphylactic reactions, a single intravenous dose of hydrocortison (100 ml) and oral dimenhydrinate (10 ml) were administered before MSCs infusion into patients. The effects of mesenchymal stem cells on the cellular and humoral immune responses and also the role of chemokines in homing of immune cells were studied at time points 1, 6 and 12 months after intravenous administration of MSCs in refractory rheumatoid arthritis."

Type III, type IV and type V LN are severe clinical entities with poor prognosis, and its treatment remains challenging. Currently, type III, type IV, type V, type III plus V and type IV plus V LN are treated mainly according to the guidelines developed by KDIGO and the European Association for Anti-Rheumatism and European League Against Rheumatism/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERAEDTA). The main therapeutic regimens recommended by these guidelines include glucocorticoid combined with immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide (CTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), etc. These medications can significantly induce disease remission and improve the long-term survival. However, some patients do not adequately response to the treatment of the combination of steroids and immunosuppressants, and the disease activity cannot be well-controlled. The high prevalence of steroids and immunosuppressants related adverse effects, such as steroid-related diabetes, bone necrosis, hypertension, peptic ulcer, CTX-related bone marrow and gonadal suppression, MMF-related infection risk and so on, have been found in long-term follow-up study. In addition, to date, there is insufficient data to support the use of new biologics, such as rituximab and abatacept in the induction therapy in patients with LN.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be obtained from several tissues and possess multiple differentiation potencies and immunomodulatory effects. The investigators have investigated the usefulness, and confirmed the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment of LN in animal models, in vitro experiments and phase I clinical trial. The studies also for the first time found that the MSC abnormalities are involved in the onset and development of lupus both in the lupus mice model and in SLE patients. The investigators found that the efficacy of allogeneic (xenogeneic) MSC transplantation is superior to autologous MSC transplantation in LN mice model. Thus, in current opinion, SLE is not only a hematopoietic stem cell disease, but also a mesenchymal stem cell disease. The investigators treated the refractory LN patients with allogenic MSC treatment, the outcomes revealed that the total response rate was 60%, the mortality rate of 2 to 5 years decreased from 35% - 45% to 6%. These results strongly support the use of allogenic MSC transplantation in the refractory LN patients. The mechanisms of MSC treatment include correcting the immune unbalance, inducing immune tolerance, tissue repair and the improvement of organ function. Allogeneic MSC transplantation for the treatment of SLE and other refractory autoimmune diseases have shown significant efficacy and excellent safety. However, these studies have limitations due to the lack of large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective study to further confirm the efficacy of allogeneic MSC transplantation, as well as the guideline for MSC treatment in SLE needs to be developed. Therefore, a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority, prospective, multicenter clinical trial is urgent needed to promote the application of MSC transplantation in SLE treatment, to bring the benefit of the patients with SLE."

When the condition worsens, the patients will not be able to feel any pain from their legs and they will not know if there are any small ulcers or cuts on their legs. As a result, a small ulcer which goes unnoticed becomes bigger and can sometimes become infected. In the worst situations, infection might lead towards gangrene and septicaemia. Severe rest pain and/or ulcerations of ischemic limbs are defined as the state of chronic critical limb ischemia and at this point, amputation of the affected limb is suggested.\n\nConventional treatments include angioplasty/bypass operation to remove blood vessel blockage to restore blood supply, the use of prescribed medicines to aid in ulcer recovery and clear infection and debridement of damaged/infected tissue. Some procedures have to be performed multiple times. Amputation is inevitable in many cases because some blood capillaries cannot be corrected and restenosis of vessels is very common. Cell therapy with mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow is promising because these stem cells are capable of stimulating and regenerating capillaries and blood vessels."

The patients signed informed consent before study. They were selected according to the following criteria: (a) the severity of lung injury was ranged from moderate 50< forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <65 to severe 40<FEV1<50; (b) absence of contraindications spirometry (hemoptysis, cerebral arterial aneurysm or aortic, pulmonary embolism, uncontrolled blood pressure, recent pneumothorax, no doubt surgery/thoracic recent, recent stroke); and (c) no coagulation. The exclusion criteria for the selection process were as follow: (a) participate in another study at the same time; (b) smoking habitat; (c) the existence of pneumonia during the study; (d) the incidence of transfusion reaction; (e) underlying other diseases (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes).\n\nIsolation and culture of adipose derived stem cells:\n\n200mL of abdominal adipose tissue was obtained under local anesthesia by liposuction aspirates protocol. The lipoaspirate was washed with PBS to remove tissue debris. 100mL PBS containing 0.1% w/v collagenase A type I was added to isolated tissue and then incubated at 37\u00baC for 60 minutes. Collagenase activity was neutralized using MEM medium along with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium after centrifugation at 2000rpm for 10 min, and then transferred to culture flasks for 72 h at 37\u00baC in 5% CO2 condition. The culture medium in the flasks was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged for two times.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis:\n\nTo analyze the cell surface antigen expression, 5\u00d7105 fresh cells from third passage were harvested by trypsin-EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 1 min, resuspended in stain buffer (PBS, 2% FBS) and then incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Trypsin was neutralized by centrifuge and isolated cells were washed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in stain buffer. Cells were incubated in dark environment for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cells were labeled with anti-human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugated to fluorochromes. These antibodies were as follow: anti-CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD73-phycoerythrin (PE), CD11b-FITC, CD34-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD45-PE, CD105-PE. The frequencies of all immunolabeled cells were analyzed by FACS Canto II flow cytometer, in which approximately 500,000 events were assessed and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0).\n\nKaryotype analysis for abnormalities detection:\n\nStandard Giemsa staining procedure was performed and chromosome preparations were obtained from 80% confluent cells. To stop microtubule formation, the cells were treated with Colcemid solution. The mitotic arrested cells were then harvested using trypsin-EDTA. The cells were extracted and then immersed in 75 mmol/l KCl for 30 minute at laboratory temperature. Finally, they obtained by a centrifugation. The supernatant was replaced with fixative solution and the suspension was spread over slides for microscopic examination and imaging. At least, 15 metaphase spreads were analyzed. The karyotypes were considered with light microscope using a cytovision software.\n\nFreezing and Storage of Adipose-derived Stem Cells:\n\nADMSCs were harvested at 90% confluence before injection for freezing. To collect cells, culture medium was removed and replaced with sterile PBS and after three minutes it was replaced with trypsin-EDTA solution and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Complete medium (MEM with 10% FBS) was added to inactivate the trypsin, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in cryopreservation medium (80% FBS, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 10% MEM medium) with a final concentration of 5 million cells per milliliter and aliquoted into cryovials. The vials stored at -80 \u00b0C overnight and then transferred into a liquid nitrogen container for long-term storage.\n\nMSCs injection and Study plan:\n\nPatients received 100\u00d7106 cells every 20 day for four injections within 2 months and screened for 7 times. MSCs were injected intravenously along with 300 ml normal saline to the patient at a maximum rate of 2\u00d7106 cells/min. Each infusion took approximately 30 minute to be completed. After each injection, patient stayed at hospital for at least 6h as recovery time. Efficacy of MSCs treatment in these patients were evaluated using the following parameters: pulmonary functions test (PFTs) [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC], total lung capacity by body plethysmography, single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (CO diffusion) , exercise performance [6-minute walk test (6MWT)], Borg scale dyspnea assessment (BSDA), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SRGQ) and comprehensive safety evaluation."

                              "A prospective, multicenter, open, randomized, parallel-group controlled study for two levels of dose.\n\nThe study population will consist of 30 non-diabetic patients with critical chronic ischemia in at least one of the lower limbs (CLI) and without possibility of revascularization, from whom results can clinically be evaluable, of whom, 20 patients will be included in the experimental group (10 for each dose level) and 10 in the control group.\n\nIn each of the two dose levels to be used in the study, 15 patients will be included, who will be randomized to the experimental group or the control group according to a distribution 2:1 (2 patients in the experimental group and 1 in control group), thus at each dose level, we will have 10 patients in the experimental group (treated with mesenchymal cells of adipose tissue) and 5 patients in the control group (conventional treatment, including the use of prostaglandins per protocol).\n\nPatients who are randomized to experimental treatment Group with CeTMAd may receive one of the following dose levels:\n\n0.5x106 cells / kg of patient weight\n1x106 cells / kg of patient weight\n\nThe recruitment will be done with escalating doses, starting at the lower dose. To switch to the higher dose will require a favorable opinion of the Ethics Committee of the H. Universitario Virgen Macarena to evaluate the clinical status of patients and therapeutic safety and study procedures.\n\nPatients who are randomized to the treatment control group will continue with conventional treatment which they were performing at the time of inclusion in the study (including the use of prostaglandins as protocol).\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of regenerative treatment with mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (CeTMAd), administered intraarterial in nondiabetic patients with chronic critical ischemia of at least one lower limb without possibilities of revascularization or alternative therapies. We will analyze the complications from regenerative therapy and / or study procedures.\n\nMain objectives:\n\nSecurity: It will be studied the possible complications due to the procedure in the first 24 hours of administration of CeTMAd, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.\nEfficiency: It will be studied the generation of new vessels (vasculogenesis) and enhancement of collateral circulation (angiogenesis / arteriogenesis).\nSecondary objectives:\n\nIt will be studied the evolution of ankle brachial index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, degree of Rutherford-Becker, ulcer size, calf perimeter, the score of pain and intermittent claudication (walking test).\n\nDuration of the clinical trial: From the infusion to the patient of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Adipose Tissue to the end of the monitoring, there will be 12 months."

Cells will be isolated from adipose tissue, expanded ex vivo and then, after ~8 weeks, intrathecal (IT) autologous delivery of MSCs will be performed. There will be 5 treatment groups of up to 5 patients each. Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2 doses of cells separated by 1 month. Groups will be completed sequentially so that patients will not be enrolled into the next treatment group until at least 3 patients in the preceding group have completed the treatment and 1 month of additional observation without significant toxicity. All patients will be followed on a regular basis until death or for a minimum of 2 years after completion of the final infusion. Initial clinical follow-up will be weekly with scheduled blood, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations. After 1 month, patients will have clinical evaluations at 3 month intervals, or earlier if indicated by clinical status.\n\nAddendum: Five subjects from the Group 5 dosing level will received additional injections of MSCs in an extension of the original study, if tolerated."

Except the hospitalization in stroke units, only thrombolysis has been shown to be efficient to treat acute ischemic stroke in the first three hours after the onset. Increasing brain plasticity after stroke represents an important alternative strategy. Cell therapy provides a functional improvement after cerebral ischemia in rodent models. This \"restorative\" therapy aims to replace destroyed cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. Despite these encouraging experiments, we do not know yet the best way of administration of the stem cells, the best dose and the optimal delay of the graft. The pioneer clinical studies failed to reproduce this benefit for patients probably because of the limited number of studied patients. Therefore, more translational studies are needed to improve our knowledge in this promising field. Among different cell sources, mesenchymal (or stromal) stem cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow offer the advantage of arising from a non tumoral and no modified source and are not sources of immunological or ethical problems.\n\nOur research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of feasibility and safety in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 3 parallel groups)."

                              "Introduction: The most important cause of death in patients with cirrhosis is the development of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF), a syndrome recently redefined with high mortality. The only effective treatment for ACLF is liver transplantation. However, available organs are limited. Other treatments, such as artificial liver support systems, do not improve survival. ACLF is characterized by increased systemic inflammatory state together with impaired liver regeneration what leads to multiorgan failure. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is an attractive strategy for ACLF owing to the immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of these cells. Aim: To investigate the effects of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs transplantation on liver and other organ functions and systemic inflammation in patients with ACLF. Altruist bone marrow donors will be the source of MSCs. Design and methodology: randomized, double-blind phase I placebo-controlled trial aimed at comparing placebo (solution without cells) and MSCs (4 doses of 2 x 106/kg administered on days 1, 4, 11 and 18). Thirty patients, 15 per group will be included. ACLF will be defined by the CLIF SOFA score and patients stratified according to severity. Outcomes evaluated will be: 1) Organ function (CLIF SOFA and CLIF-C ACLF score); 2) Liver (Child-Pugh and MELD scores,serum bile acids, ammonia and lactate levels), circulatory (systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics, renin, noradrenalin) and endothelial function (nitric oxide, von Willebrand factor); 3 Inflammatory response (serum cytokine panel and transcriptomic analysis of monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells from peripheral blood); 4) Survival at 28 days, 3 and 12 months; and 5) Safety. Expected results: Therapy with MSCs could have beneficial effects on the evolution of patients with ACLF (modulation of inflammatory response and improvement of liver and extra-hepatic organ function) what could translate into an improvement on short-term survival."

According to targeted organs, cGVHD is divided into two types, limited cGVHD and extensive cGVHD. Extensive cGVHD needs systemic immunosuppressant treatment. However, currently standard first-line regimen including cyclophosphamide and prednisolone is only effective for some patients. Novel treatment is urgently needed. Our previous study has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective for cGVHD patients with multiple skin damage. To further explore the therapeutic effect of MSCs for extensive cGVHD, we plan to conduct a multi-center clinical trial. Patients who developed an extensive cGVHD (with skin and/or liver damage) after HSCs transplantation and do not respond to first-line therapy are enrolled. They will be randomly divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and routine second-line drugs respectively. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSCs for extensive cGVHD by comparison of symptom improvement, survival rate, recurrence as well as side effects in the two groups."

                              "This study, is designed as a phase 1/2 open-safety clinical trial. At its first phase, 15 consenting patients with MS are included.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nConsenting patients fulfilled the following 4 inclusion criteria for this study:\n\nthe clinical criteria of Poser et alfor definite MS;\nmen and nonpregnant women aged 25 to 65 years;\nduration of disease longer than 5 years; and\nfailure to respond to the currently available and registered agents for MS (ie, interferons, glatiramer acetate [Copaxone], and immuno-suppressors), as manifested by an increase of at least 1 degree in the EDSS score during the past year or the appearance of at least 2 major MS relapses during the same period.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\npatients who were treated with cytotoxic medications (ie, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and azathioprine) during the 3 months before the trial;\npatients with significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure or any other disease that may interfere with the ability to interpret the results of the study;\npatients with an active infection; and\npatients who showed severe cognitive decline or were unable to understand and sign the informed consent.\n\nBone marrow aspiration is performed under short general anesthesia with puncture from the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or a right lateral position. Approximately 200 mL of bone marrow inocula are obtained from each patient.\n\nMSC Preparation and Culture A culture of purified MSCs is prepared under aseptic conditions (positively pressurized clean rooms) using filtered sterilized Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with low glucose lev- els (Qiagen, Valencia, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- nystatin solution (all from Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit- Haemek, Israel).\n\nMesenchymal cells are cultured for 40 to 60 days, until they reach confluency, and then harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide-containing medium in liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C). At 2 weeks, a sample is taken for sterility testing and quality control. After sterility confirmed, the MSCs are transferred to the laboratory on dry ice, thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and washed twice with normal saline solution to remove any residual dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells are then resuspended in normal saline at a concentration of 10x106/mL to 15x106/mL. Two-thirds of the total number of cells (usually 60x106 to 100x106) are injected intrathecally, and one-third, intravenously. A sample of the cells to be injected is tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis; cells (98%) should express the surface markers characteristic of MSCs (CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and be negative for CD34, CD45, and CD14.\n\nTreatment Protocol All patients receive an intrathecal injection via a standard lumbar puncture (mean of 1 million cells per Kg of body weight) and an intravenous injection of 0.3-1 million cells per kg, intravenously..\n\nAn extension phase is scheduled for patients completing the first phase of this trial as an open prospective study with repeated intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous MSC in patients from the initial trial and 10 additional ones (total up to 24 patients) with progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive or relapsing-progressive). Patients should be defined as failures to first and second lines of immunomodulatory treatments experiencing deterioration (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS scale) during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major relapse without sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of body weight, intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or IV-injections of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the trial is 4 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).\n\nImmunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month 6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS) analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune activation or of regulatory cell phenotype."

Novel treatment is urgently needed for patients who have an incomplete response to UDCA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent a promising tool for cell-based therapies of autoimmune diseases. To explore the therapeutic effect of MSCs for PBC, the investigators plan to conduct an open-label, randomized clinical trial. Patients with PBC will be enrolled and randomly divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and UDCA respectively. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSCs for PBC by comparison of symptom improvement, survival rate and side effects in the two groups."

For the patients who have suffered from ischemic stroke in 3 months, indeed, they have the opportunity to get symptomatic improvement through receiving conventional stroke treatments that including rehabilitation. At the same time, these treatments are ineffective in some cases. Alternatively, the phenomenon of increasing brain plasticity after stroke provoke an essential therapy. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment enhances a functional improvement after cerebral ischemia, likewise, treament in rodent models are proved effective. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells therapy performs a role as take the place destroyed cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. The totality of evidence from trials running umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplanted into patients suffering from ischemic stroke support the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, positive results are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nOur research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of safety and efficacy in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 2 parallel groups)."

                              "Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow. Experimental and clinical studies to date have shown that mesenchymal stem cells represent the most suitable cell type for regeneration therapy after myocardial infarction (MI). After injection into ischemic myocardium, bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) from various animal species can differentiate into multiple cell lineages, including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, thereby improving LV function.\n\nIn Malaysia we have previously demonstrated our capability in isolating and extracting MSC from a small volume of bone marrow aspirates.The isolation, expansion and feasibility of storage, transport and differentiation of human MSC for clinical application has been performed locally. The researchers used autologous BM-MSC, ex vivo expanded, on three patients with end-stage ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who were on the heart transplant waiting list and each patient was injected with MSCs directly into the myocardium during open heart surgery. After twelve months, all patients remained alive and well with significant improvement in cardiac function, quality of life and other parameters including reduction of myocardial scar volume as seen from cardiac scans.\n\nThe same group of researchers further carried out a study on ten patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and refractory cardiac function despite maximum medical therapy to receive autologous BM-MSC implantation via intramyocardial or intracoronary route. All patients remained alive at 1 year while recorded significant improvements in LV ejection fraction and other LV parameters from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Reduction in scar was also noted in six of the patients by 12 months.\n\nFollowing these results, this study aims to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population."

The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the injections. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as secondary endpoints.\n\nApplications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a \"run-in\" period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.\n\nOne month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post last MSC-injection.\n\nTo establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-\"run in period\" and for the whole duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared to the progression rate during the \"run-in\" period.\n\nThe follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters: WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.\n\nAll selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen. One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using our previously described protocol with slight modification.\n\nOne month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula."

The goal of this study is to determine the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.\n\nThe MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually located in the arm or hand. All participants will receive standard of care and their safety will be monitored throughout the study."

                              "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) refers to the clinicopathological synthesis of lymphocytes from the donor attacking the recipient's organs during the process of rebuilding the donor's immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) Signs (including classic cGVHD and overlap syndrome) are one of the main complications after transplantation, with an incidence of 30% to 70%. cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. main reason. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) About 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD.\n\nIn 2002, Frassoni reported for the first time that MSCs expanded in vitro were used to evaluate the efficacy of allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT transplanted patients with hematological malignancies were enrolled. MSCs were derived from the donor's bone marrow. After expanded in vitro, participants were combined with the donor's hematopoietic stem cells for reinfusion. As a result, the incidence of aGVHD in the MSCs expansion group and cGVHD within 6 months was significantly lower in the control group, the 6-month OS was significantly higher than that in the control group, and there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate. Subsequently, in 2004, Le Blanc and others successfully used third-party MSCs to successfully treat a refractory grade IV intestinal combined with liver aGVHD for the first time. Subsequently, MSCs were increasingly used in clinical studies for the treatment of GVHD. More clinical trials have shown that umbilical cord-derived MSCs cultured in vitro can not only promote the implantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), but also reduce the incidence of severe GVHD in patients, showing a good therapeutic effect."

                              "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both. Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

An international panel of MS neurology and stem cell experts, as well as immunologists formed an \"International Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation\" (MSCT) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism that underlie the benefit. 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells. Clinical and objective evaluations will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up."

We have recently conducted preclinical studies on the effects of ischemic preconditioning on the MSC functions. We have evaluated the characteristics of rat MSCs after culture with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum obtained from rat stroke model. Compared to FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity."

                              "Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty. Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July 2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies"

All patients will be selected and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups based on clinical presentation. Participants will be exposed to abdominal liposuction procedure under local anesthesia for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) harvesting. Stem cells will be separated from fat cells in the adipose tissue then activated in the Polish Stem Cell Bank. The activated stem cells will be injected into the knee joint via 22G spinal needle. The intra-articular stem cells injections will be performed under ultrasound guidance at the theater under spinal anesthesia. Each patient will receive a single dose of at least 10 million of ADMSC in 3 mL of normal saline every three months for 12 months (maximum four doses in total and at least 40 million of ADMSC in total) via ultrasound guided intra-articular injection. During the study period and 24 months after last injection they will be followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the injected joint. The local and systemic safety of the procedure and therapy with ADMSC will be also determined during study."

To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of an Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce sodium iodine symporter (NIS) (measles virus [MV]-NIS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, delivered by adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). (Phase I) II. To assess the 12 month overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the tolerability of this regimen. (Phase II) II. To assess the 4 month progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) III. To assess the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)\n\nTRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging. (Phase II) II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration. (Phase II) III. To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. (Phase II) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion the development of antitumor immune response. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study.\n\nPatients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (if MSC are not available, MV-NIS may be given alone) IP over 30 minutes of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years."

                              "The standard treatment for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation, however, it has several limitations, including small donor pool, long waiting list, and several complications. Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo controlled trial. After assignment of the written informed consent, thirty six patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be enrolled, and will be randomized by block randomization into treatment or placebo arm. All the enrolled patients will be in the waiting list of liver transplantation. In the treatment arm bone marrow of the patients will be aspirated, and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells will be cultured, and then will be infused through a peripheral vein. Also, the corresponding placebo will be infused for the placebo group. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after performing the procedure."

The number of samples in each group is three.\n\nSubject Criteria Inclusion Criteria for MSC Donor from Umbilical Cord:\n\nUmbilical cord are collected from elective caesarean section from a fullterm pregnancies without any complication and free from HIV, Hepatitis B, C, D virus, Cytomegalovirus, Rubella Virus, and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nRecipient inclusion criteria of osteoarthritis samples are patients aged 30-80 years old, based on genu X-ray examination and Kellgren-Lawrence grading is I, II, and III, or KL grade III with corrective osteotomy, minimal Visual Analog Scale = 2 (0-10), unresponsive with pharmacological therapy, and also sign up the informed consent.\n\nRecipient exclusion criteria are Osteoarthritis KL grade IV, and secondary osteoarthritis due to trauma, infection, rheumatoid arthritis, congenital diseases, and autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity of hyaluronan product, cancer, pregnant women.\n\nDrop Out Criteria patients are ruled out from this study while the research are held or they undergo another treatment that are not related to this study. All drop out subjects could get another treatment.\n\nInformed consent all of subjects must be filled and signed up before ruled in this study.\n\nAs soon as after delivery, umbilical cord is collected and processed in sterile specimen 0,9% NaCl at 4oC during 8 hours. The umbilical cord transported to the laboratory and cultured in GMP lab, at UPTTK Sel Punca Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Cellular viability and proliferation are evaluated after cell characterization test by flowcytometer.\n\nSterility test are done three times to ensure cellular sterility. Subjects are positioned in supine position, site of injection are determined by the operator. Injection from superolateral or superomedial in extension knee position, injection from anterolateral or anteromedial in flexion knee position. Aseptic and antiseptic in site of injection use povidone iodine 3 times, then swab by alcohol. Local anesthetic by lidocaine 1% is injected subcutaneously.\n\nMonitoring at the site of injection encompass allergic reaction, pain, and swelling. Patients are approached to be followed up every three months, in 1st ,3rd ,6th ,12th month, for clinical examination, VAS, IKDC and WOMAC Score. Cartigram MRI are evaluated every six month, in 6th and 12th month."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. They are used by multicellular organism to organize, coordinate, and regulate multiple functions of cells and tissues in the body. They are considered as chemical messenger molecules that send signals from one cell to another within or between various body parts. Hormones are responsible for regulating many physiological processes and behavioral activities such as growth and development of the body, metabolism, homeostasis of intracellular and extracellular fluid, and reproduction. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function. The phase I clinical study named \" Single-group, open-label clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for early sex hormone deficiency in middle-aged people\" showed that AD-MSC therapy for patients with hormone deficiency is safe, can improve the sexual quality of life in both men and women. A significant statistical increase of testosterone levels was observed in male patients at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month. In female patients, the FSFI was 20.70 at baseline and increased to 27.1 at 12 months after AD-MSC infusion (p<0.05). There were no significant changes in AMH, FSH, or E2 infusion compared to baseline in the 16 enrolled patients. Within those under 45 years old, FSH and E2 tended to increase at 3 months after ADSC infusion and decreased at the follow-up after 6 and 12 months. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

MSV-H cells are obtained directly from biopsy culture jawbone of the patient by cultivation techniques \"in vitro\" and differentiate for 21 days once conveyed in the matrix with osteogenic differentiation medium of the following composition: DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% P / E, 0.1 mM dexamethasone, 50 mM ascorbate 2-phosphate, 10 mM phosphate \u00dfGlicerol. All differentiation factors have already been approved for clinical use. After the period of the product differentiation can be implanted to the patient.\n\nThe bioimplant is used to refill the bone defects after osteotomy and maxillary cyst enucleation, with 5-10 million cells per unit of 2 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm thick. The cavity is closed with the mucoperiosteal flap and sutured with reabsorbable material. The end point of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and indications of treatment efficacy according to both clinical criteria and objective imaging confirming the volumetric bone regeneration and maintenance over time.

                              "Frailty is an aging-related syndrome of impaired physiologic reserve and function across multiple organs, leading to increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes. Frailty is associated with an increased risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Given the rapid growth in the aging population, the prevalence of frailty will continue to increase. In fact, Veterans receiving care at Veterans Health Administration are a high risk population for onset of frailty due to being predominantly older associated with a larger proportion of minorities, lower socioeconomic and educational status, higher prevalence of comorbidities, and higher rates of unemployment. Frailty now affects at least 3 of every 10 U.S. Veterans aged 65 years and older and is strongly associated with mortality. It is increasingly being recognized that frailty may be an appropriate target for intervention to reduce disability and dependence in older adults. However, there are no specific medical or biologic treatments that ameliorate or reverse frailty. Conversely, stem cell depletion is a key mechanism for age-related frailty. There is a strong link between frailty, inflammation, and the impaired ability to repair tissue injury due to decreases in endogenous stem cell production. Accordingly, a cell-based, regenerative treatment strategy i.e., allogenic bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy may represent a novel therapy for aging frailty. MSCs migrate into the site of injury and home to the affected tissue, where they act to reduce inflammation and promote cellular repair. The advantages of MSCs as a therapeutic strategy for age-related frailty include availability, ease of isolation and expansion, multilineage differentiation and immunosuppression, free from ethical issues, and limited replicative lifespan. In this 6-month pilot study, the investigators will assess 1) the feasibility of MSC therapy in age-related frailty as it relates to functional improvement and 2) develop/refine MSC therapy as a new intervention in older Veterans with frailty, and thus provide preliminary participant response to inform a future trial."

                              "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide epidemic disease that the global prevalence of it was estimated to be approximately 210 million individuals and accounting for more than three million deaths annually. And currently, it is the fifth chief cause of death in the United State of America. COPD is characterized by chronic, irreversible inflammation of the airways and has two pathologic features, emphysema and bronchiolitis.\n\nThe most relevant feature in the lung emphysema is airflow limitation, resulting from the loss of alveolar wall and enlargement of alveolar space distal to the terminal bronchiole. Cigarette and air pollution are the most major factors for developing COPD. Unfortunately, aside from supplemental domiciliary oxygen for the small number of patients who demonstrate resting arterial hypoxemia and smoking cessation for continued smokers, there are no interventions that have been unequivocally shown to prolong survival in patients with COPD. In the preprocessing phase, patients will underwent a complete evaluation of the pulmonary function test with spirometer to measure the FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, cardiac evaluation (clinical examination, six minute walk test, echocardiography TTE(transthoracic echocardiography ), and electrocardiography),chest X-ray, chest computed tomography scan (helical/high resolution),o2 saturation by oximeter, as well as routine laboratory tests (blood gas, urinalysis, coagulation, complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen, fasting glucose, creatinine, AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALT(alanine aminotransferase), C-reactive protein, serology for hepatitis B and C, antihuman immunodeficiency virus, and treponemal test for syphilis (FTA-ABS)). The Dyspnea Scale Score test, modified according to the British MMRC, was also conducted, according to Mahler and Wells and Curley.And quality of life measures will assess according to SF-36(Medical Outcomes Study 36-Items Short-Form Health Survey) questioner.\n\nPatients will taken to the operating room, placed in a prone position, and administer a spinal anesthesia. Approximately, 120 mL of bone marrow will aspirated from each puncture and after preparation about 60 million autologous MSCs will transplant by bronchoscopy into the endobronchial of these patients."

                              "Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. During the last decade, treatments for heart failure have evolved, but their purpose is to improve symptoms and prevent aggravation of the disease. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide trophic and paracrine support or even replace dying cells with new ones. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. These cells are known for their ability to secrete paracrine factors and their immunosuppressive properties. The MESAMI 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of MSCs injection directly into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people with chronic ischemic heart failure using NOGA-XP system.\n\nThis phase 2 study is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 90 patients will be randomized in 2 arms to receive intramyocardial injection of MSCs or placebo. Patients will be followed up for 13 months. Bone marrow will be collected and immediately transported to the French Blood Establishment for MSC isolation and expansion. Patients will receive intramyocardial injection of MSCs or placebo during a left heart catheterization."

                              "Liver failure (LF) is a severe life-threatening condition, and is a dramatic clinical syndrome with massive necrosis of liver cells, and liver transplantation is the only available therapeutic option for patients suffering with this condition. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems. Since current therapeutic options for LF that is usually with extremely poor prognosis are still limited, recent studies indicate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their function in immune modulation and liver-damage repair, are of great therapeutic potential for this disease. Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) replace hepatocytes in injured liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration.The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and initial efficacy of human umbilical cord MSC (UC-MSCs) treatment for patients with LF. In this study, MSCs were isolated from umbilical cord and generated in appropriate growth medium. 50 LF patients with LF received i.v. transfusion of 0.5-1.0\u00d7106 cells/kg of MSCs as the treated group and other 20 LF patients with LF were transfused with placebo without MSCs as control group. All 70 of them received the routine management for liver failure. During the 2-year follow up, the evaluation of safty and efficacy will be undergone to help to establish innovative cell-based therapies for the treatment of diseases."

However, ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBLs) are still one of the most serious complications after OLT, with a usual reported incidence of 5-15%, and an incidence of up to 26% in some studies. 46% patients with ITBLs require re-transplantation after 2 years of OLT.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),a kind of pluripotent stem cells,can differentiate into vascular endothelial cells, which participate in angiogenesis in ischemic tissue. MSCs can also stimulate the proliferation and migration of mature endothelial cells via paracrine.Furthermore, MSCs secret a variety of cytokines and growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, human basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-1 and interleukin-8, etc., which also induce angiogenesis.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 6 months of standard regular treatment for ITBLs plus huc-MSCs treatment.\nArm B: Participants will receive 6 months of standard regular treatment for ITBLs plus placebo.\n\nhuc-MSCs will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. After huc-MSCs transfusion, patients are followed up once per week(in the first months,<1M),once per 2 week(1-3M)and once per month(3-6M), and the evaluation of liver function and biliary blood supply was performed."

However, even with rehabilitation therapy, 50% to 95% of stroke survivors remain impaired. There is thus a great need for new therapeutic developments for patients with disability after stroke, which is largely unexplored. Regenerative cell-based therapies offer long-term hope for many patients with stroke, as stem cells might be possible for dead or injured neural cells to be replaced after acute stroke. In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation."

CM is frequently complicated by overuse of acute pain medications. Some drugs have regulatory approval for migraine prophylaxis; none are approved specifically for CM prophylaxis although recently, botulinum injection has been FDA approved for CM treatment with marginal treatment effects with many patients failing to have complete remission.

                              "Viral pneumonia is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by respiratory viruses. It is mainly caused by the invasion of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and adenovirus into the lower respiratory tract. Every winter and spring is the epidemic season. Influenza virus and adenovirus have high infectivity and pathogenicity. The rapid progress of some patients may be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction And died of complications. The fatality rate of severe patients is 9.8% - 60%. Most of the dead cases were the elderly and the patients with basic diseases. In addition to the complications, the main cause of death is ARDS caused by virus infection, on the other hand, the basic immune function of the elderly is poor, so it is difficult to form an effective antiviral response in response to virus infection. The direct destruction of the alveolar epithelial barrier and the systemic inflammatory response induced by the infection, namely, the destruction of the alveolar capillary barrier by the inflammatory waterfall, are the important pathogenesis of ARDS. How to effectively regulate the inflammatory response, prevent the inflammatory exudation and edema of the lungs, improve oxygenation, and reduce organ damage; at the same time, how to effectively improve the basic immune function and enhance the anti-virus immune response of such patients, has become the key to the success of the treatment of patients with severe viral pneumonia.\n\nUmbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) can differentiate into the different germ layers and play an important role in immune regulation and damage repair regulation. Clinical trials have shown that MSC is safe and effective in the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, and it can improve the immune function of patients with viral infectious diseases. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against severe viral pneumonia.\n\nThis is a randomized, singlecenter, open lable, intervention controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 40) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The routine treatment group (n = 20) will receive the treatment according to \"Influenza diagnosis and treatment plan (2019 version)\", the HUC-MSCs adjuvant Group (n = 20) will receive intravenous infusion of definitive HUC-MSCs (1\u00d710^6 cells/Kg \u00d7 body weight(kg), which was selected by immunomodulatory assay through coculture with BV2 cell) on the basis of the routine treatment once at day 1 after joining. Follow-up duration is 90 days. The difference of 90 day mortality and average length of stay between the two groups will be observed and recorded. The changes of inflammatory index, viral load, oxygenation index and pulmonary imaging will be monitored at different time points after treatment in the two groups. The serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) will be observed during the period.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore the efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of severe viral pneumonia through improving the antiviral immune response of patients, reduce the lung inflammatory damage caused by the virus and the pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the injury, and finally achieve the goal of reducing the mortality and improving the prognosis of severe patients, and to evaluate the safety."

However, CNI toxicity leads to significant morbidity. Moreover, CNIs cannot prevent long-term allograft injury.\n\nMesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) have potent immunomodulatory properties, which may promote allograft tolerance and ameliorate toxicity of high-dose CNI. The MYSTEP1 trial aims to investigate safety and feasibility of donor-derived MSCs in pLT.\n\nMethods/Design: 7 to 10 children undergoing living-donor pLT will be included in this open-label, prospective pilot trial. A dose of 1 \u00d7 106 MSCs/kg body weight will be given at two time points: first by intraportal infusion intraoperatively and second by intravenous infusion on postoperative day 2. In addition, participants will receive standard immunosuppressive treatment. Our primary objective is to assess the safety of intraportal and intravenous MSC infusion in pLT recipients. Our secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of MSC treatment as measured by the individual need for immunosuppression and the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection. We will perform detailed immune monitoring to investigate immunomodulatory effects.\n\nDiscussion: Our study will provide information on the safety of donor-derived MSCs in pediatric living-donor liver transplantation and their effect on immunomodulation and graft survival."

                              "Diabetic foot ulcers are a significant and rapidly growing complication of diabetes and its effects on wound healing. Over half of diabetic patients who develop a single ulcer will subsequently develop another ulcer of which the majority will become chronic non-healing ulcers. Over the past decade, the outcomes for patients with ulcers have not improved, despite advances in wound care.These data suggest the importance and necessity of alternative and more effective treatment option for diabetic patients with non-healing ulcers. (Blumberg et al 2012). Stem cell therapy has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for various diseases including wound repair and tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) represent an important stem cell population with multipotent capabilities that may have high utility for translational clinical applications. MSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, especially fascia originated cells, and provide soluble factors for regeneration of tissues and organs(\u015eener et al 2015). Adipose tissue is an abundant source of mesenchymal stem cells, which have shown an improved outcome in wound healing studies. Adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs )are pluripotent stem cells with the ability to differentiate into different lineages and to secrete paracrine factors initiating tissue regeneration process. The abundant supply of fat tissue, ease of isolation, extensive proliferative capacities ex vivo, and their ability to secrete pro-angiogenic growth factors make them an ideal cell type to use in therapies for the treatment of nonhealing wounds(Hassan et al 2014), However the hostile microenviroment may interfere with viability and efficiency of MSCs injection specially in ischemic tissue , thus increasing needs for new strategies for further improvement of the stem cell therapy of diabetic wounds. Curcumin loaded chitosan nanoparticles into collagen-alginate is a novel biodegradable and biocompatible material that might help a lot in regenerative efficiency in ischemic wound healing"

Screening will include a physical exam, blood draw, pregnancy test, questions about medical history, current medications, and alcohol or drug use, an electrocardiogram (ECG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart, questionnaires, an echocardiogram and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Eligible participants will then undergo two baseline visits within 6 weeks of their scheduled surgery. Baseline Visit 1 will consist of vital sign measurements, a bone marrow aspiration to obtain MSCs and a blood draw for a biomarker test. Baseline Visit 2 will include treadmill test, 6-minute walk test, pulmonary function (FEV1) study and a 48 Hour Ambulatory ECG. After the second baseline visit, participants will be assigned randomly to receive either MSCs or placebo after surgery.\n\nOn the day of surgery, once all of the bypass grafts have been placed, a high or low dose of MSCs or placebo will be injected into a damaged area of the heart that did not receive a bypass graft. After receiving the injections, participants will remain in the hospital for up to 7 days.

Today there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nExperimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and are found in all structural tissues of the body.\n\nIn the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.\n\nAmong the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017) that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial."

                              "Liver cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by the formation and accumulation of an extracellular matrix, which leads to the progressive distortion of the hepatic architecture. In China, the most important cause of liver cirrhosis is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver cirrhosis usually progresses irreversibly into advanced stage, such as a decompensated stage which is characterized by a series of clinical manifestations, including ascites, variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy with high mortality. Liver transplantation is the only option that can improve the survival of these decompensated liver cirrhosis patients; however, this procedure is associated with several limitations, such as the severe shortage of donor livers, long waiting lists, multiple complications, and high cost. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nAnimal models have shown that bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) can ameliorate liver fibrosis and reverse fulminant hepatic failure. In clinical, autologous BM-MSC have significantly improved liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. A recent research also found that autologous BM-MSC therapy safely improved histological fibrosis and liver function in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Allogeneic MSC therapy, such as umbilical cord-derived MSC (UC-MSC), have shown to be safe and beneficial for the patients with liver cirrhosis caused by autoimmune diseases. Our previous studies showed that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients and increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients. However, the single-center clinical study, the relative small size of the patient cohorts, absence of evaluation on long-term efficacy prevent firm conclusions being made with regard to the safety and efficacy of this treatment in liver diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how UC-MSC can improve the liver function, and the incidence of serious complications in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a multi-center clinical study."

                              "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier between photoreceptor cells and choroidal blood vessels. Photoreceptor cells are vitally and functionally dependent on the RPE. The conversion of blood glucose to ATP, synthesis of proteins in the visual cycle and removal of metabolic waste takes place in the RPE. For these important processes, various peptide growth factors and their receptors are synthesized in the RPE. More than 260 genes in the RPE are responsible for the production of these peptide fragments. Mutations in any of these genes as well as ischemic, physical or chemical RPE damage causes retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration may be inherited, such as in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Stargardt's disease, choroideremia, Best vitelliform dystrophy and Bietti's crystalline dystrophy. Retinal degeneration may also be acquired through genetic mechanisms, such as age-releated macular degeneration. In retinal degeneration, there is a developing loss of RPE and photoreceptors, regardless of the underlying cause.\n\nUmbilical cord Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) have significant paracrine and immunomodulatory properties. WJ-MSCs secrete trophic factors that stimulate RPE or secrete trophic factors that are similar to those produced by RPE. In studies using animal models, WJ-MSCs have been found to be effective in stopping the progression of retinal degeneration and for rescuing photoreceptors in the dormant phase. WJ-MSCs are hypoimmunogenic and have significant immunomodulatory properties. WJ-MSCs have been shown to suppress chronic inflammation and prevent apoptosis in animal models of neurodegenerative and ischemic retinal disorders. WJ-MSCs also stimulate progenitor cells in the retina and elicit self-repair mechanisms.\n\nThe aim of this preliminary clinical study is to investigate the ef\ufb01cacy of deep sub-tenon injected WJ-MSCs as a stem cell treatment modality for the management of retinitis pigmentosa, which creates outer retinal degeneration. These functional and structural effects were investigated using microperimetry, electrophysiology and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective clinical study that utilizes a large number of RP cases, and cases that are in phase-3."

                              "Knee osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Treatments involve high costs in terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded \"in vitro\" and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has demonstrated that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation through its action on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one carried out in an equine by our research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy evidence proposed treatment protocol. Our research group has also experience in preparing clinical-grade MSC from bone marrow for other clinical trials and has all the necessary facilities and permissions to comply with GMPs imposed by recent EU legislation. Finally, our clinical team has a wide experience in regenerative therapies in several previous clinical trials for bone and cartilage.\n\nWe present here an alternative proposal, aiming to anti-inflammation and regeneration by injection of single dose of mesenchymal stem cells expanded from autologous bone marrow by the GMP-complying IBGM-Valladolid procedure (MSV). Treatment involves two non-invasive surgical procedures with low morbidity: obtaining bone marrow under local anesthesia and sedation, and 4 weeks later, articular injection of the cell product (20 millions MSVs). The injection of cells does not even require anesthesia and obtaining bone marrow requires an outpatient admission two hours following safety criteria.\n\nPatients will be evaluated clinically, including pain score (VSA), pain and disability indexes (WOMAC and Lequesne) and life quality (SF-36), and by radiologic and MRI procedures no contrast and allowing quantification of morphological and structural changes of the cartilage region studied (MRI T2-mapping).\n\nThe design of the study is an open-label prospective, multicenter study. It will recruit 12 patients with osteoarthritis of II-IV Kellgren and Lawrence grades, Patients will be evaluated clinically by previous studies imaging (X-rays and MRI). If they are eligible for the study we shall provide them information about the clinical trial with the \"Patient Information Sheet, quoting them for the Inclusion Visit. In the \"Inclusion Visit\" if the patient decides to participate in the test should sign the Informed Consent Document and a schedule for MRI and X-rays will be scheduled. The results of this exploration will be considered the standard to which compare any given change in the controls at 6 and 12 months. On this visit, routine preoperative examinations are performed (EKG, chest X-ray AP, basic analytic coagulation tests and identification of HIV, Lues and hepatitis B and C and the valuation by the Internal Medicine Service).\n\nDuring the visit V0 we shall verify that all inclusion criteria persist and not exclusion criteria have appeared, and we shall program V1 (to obtain bone marrow) and provide a preliminary date for MSV injection 4 week later (V2). After application, the patients will have follow-up schedule at 8 days (V3), 3 (V4), 6 (V5), 12 (V6) and eventually 24 months (V7) as detailed below.\n\nV0: Eligibility. Clinical History. Analysis, Imaging test. Programming of the following visits V1 (day 0): Bone marrow aspiration under local anesthesia and sedation V2 (day 23). MSV Implantation. V3 (+8 days from Implantation): Security evaluation. V4 (+3 months from Implantation): Security evaluation. VAS, WOMAC, Lequesne Index, SF-36 questionnaires.\n\nV5 (+6 months from Implantation): Security evaluation.

                              "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders, affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to respiratory failure. Numerous studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the clinical and pathological features of ALS. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine) effect of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrollment. Patients are recruited for a clinical trial not longer than 1 year from disease diagnosis. Then, patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one application of BM-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications (each administration every two months) of BM-MSCs. Subsequently, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period."

                              "Problem of Interest: Lung transplantation represents a potential therapy for patients with end-stage lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema and cystic fibrosis. The major limitation to long term survival in lung transplant recipients is the development of graft failure over time, termed bronchiolitis obliterans. The conventional therapies used to prevent rejection are not effective in preventing bronchiolitis obliterans. Therefore, new therapies are needed to address this problem. A growing body of research has focused on a unique population of bone marrow cells termed Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to improve a range of medical conditions including heart failure, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. MSCs can prevent animal models of bronchiolitis obliterans. Because of this information, it is plausible that MSCs could help patients as a potential treatment in lung transplantation. MSCs can be obtained from 2 sources: commercially available MSCs which are generated from other normal volunteers and from the patient themselves. When MSCs are obtained from the patient for whom they are used, they are termed \"autologous MSCs\". A major potential drawback to the use of commercially available MSCs is that these cells contain proteins from other individuals which could provoke rejection when used in lung transplant recipients. Therefore, the use of autologous MSCs currently appears the most attractive option. What is not understood at the present time is the extent to which autologous MSCs obtained from chronically ill patients with end-stage lung disease still maintain properties which would be beneficial. This proposal will test the immunologic properties of MSCs generated from such individuals to answer the question of whether generation of whether it would be feasible to use such cells in the future to prevent entities such as bronchiolitis obliterans.\n\nOverview on how this will be studied: The Investigator will approach patients who are being considered for a lung transplant because of end stage lung disease. Enrolled patients will undergo a bone marrow aspiration where a small amount of fluid is removed from their pelvic bone. Cells obtained in this procedure will be expanded in the Emory/Georgia Tech Cell Lab. MSCs will be expanded in this lab using cell culture conditions which are standardly used for MSCs. The Investigator will test the efficiency of expansion of these MSCs to determine if they can be obtained from all patients, or if there some patients demonstrate inefficient MSC expansion based on age or disease or other factors. The Investigator will then test in-vitro the ability of MSCs from different patients to prevent activation of the immune system when faced with proteins from other individuals. The Investigator believes this model system approximates the type of interaction that would occur if these MSCs were given to patients who received a lung transplant.\n\nBenefit of research to knowledge and human health: It is not presently known whether patients with severe medical illness are able to have MSCs expanded. If it is found that MSCs can be readily obtained from such individuals and additionally find that such MSCs have properties which would be predicted to be beneficial in lung transplant, this study would provide the rationale to use MSCs as a therapeutic agent in patients undergoing lung transplantation."

GMSCs have shown to have higher rate of successive culture and proliferation compared to other sources of stem cells, and have demonstrated multi-lineage differentiation in osteoblastic, adipocytic, chondrocytic, endothelial and neural directions, however most of our present understanding and elucidation models stem from in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models, which do not entirely translate to human clinical situations. To bridge our current knowledge gaps of tissue development processes, deeper understanding of biological processes is required, before reliable biologically based regenerative therapies become a clinical reality. Palatal gingival connective tissue, which can be a great source of GMSCs, is harvested primarily for treating gingival recession around teeth or dental implants. There is very little studied on the histological, cellular make up and the soft and hard tissue regenerative potential of this tissue owing to the presence of GMSCs. Also, the clinical decision as to where to harvest the tissue from relies on the amount of available tissue, indication of the treatment, and the clinical preference of the operator rather than based on progenitor potential and regenerative capabilities of the underlying cells.\n\nHence aim of this study is to investigate the progenitor potential of palatal GMSCs as well as characterizing and observing the functionality of isolated MSCs at two different palatal sites within the same patient.\n\nThe study will retrieve human soft tissue (gum tissue) samples from the roof of the mouth (palate) that are collected during soft tissue (gum) grafting surgical procedures routinely performed and are standard of care for treating gum recession in the School of Dentistry's Periodontology Clinic. For research purposes an additional 4mm of soft tissue samples will be obtained from two sites that is 2mm from front site (premolar) and 2mm from back site (molar) from the roof of the mouth (palate). The samples will be placed in sterile vials in the carrier medium and will be immediately transferred to the laboratory for the analysis. The remaining soft tissue (gum) graft will be used to cover the gum recession defects in that patient's mouth. A plastic guard will be placed on the roof of the mouth (palate) after the procedure to reduce post-op discomfort."

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Onset typically occurs in early adulthood. Patients present with intermittent symptoms that are partially reversible; this form is termed relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Over time, most patients develop secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) which manifests as irreversible and gradual neurological impairments that often progress without acute relapses. Beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate represents the first line therapeutic option for RRMS. Clinical trials confirm that show partial efficacy, though they do not prevent the onset of secondary progression. SPMS, is the consequence of axonal loss and neurodegeneration and no current therapy has been effective. Stem cell therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. Clinical indications for adult stem cells, which can be safely harvested and normally behave well without formation of tumours, are rapidly increasing. The majority of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both, which can be easily obtained in clinically sufficient numbers from peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or umbilical cord blood and placenta. MSC can readily be isolated from a small sample of bone marrow and rapidly expanded so as to generate large numbers of cells for autologous therapies. When administered intravenously have an immune suppressive effect that can ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. When intravenously injected, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of brain-resident cells. Several disease models demonstrate axonal neuroprotection following MSC therapy, with some evidence that this is potentially mediated through the production of neurotrophic/growth factors, and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSC. For that reasons, MSC have become the focus of research as a potential cell therapy for inducing neuroprotection in human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.\n\nA growing body of literature confirms the therapeutic MSC biological properties, and provide a plausible mechanism of action to guide clinical trial design with a number of phase I/II trials in MS patients now underway. Experimental clinical trials in MS are being considered or have recently been initiated by several research groups, which are testing the therapeutic potential of different sources of MSC. Learning from previous clinical studies, and taking advantage of the potential that adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair and remyelination, to plan a clinical trial in patients with inflammatory MS seems reasonable. We propose a safety trial of a single intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSC into 8 subjects with RRMS. The trial proposed here will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC therapy during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS can establish a immunomodulatory and regenerative microenvironment and reverse neurological disability in RRMS patients."

The human umbilical cord (HUC) is a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), compared to embryonic stem cells, HUC-MSCs are noncontroversial with a painless collection procedure and faster self-renewal properties. HUC-MSCs can differentiate into the different germ layers and modulate immune responses. One possible mechanism for the onset and development of aging frailty is the depletion of stem cells. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against aging frailty.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 30) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The HUC-MSCs Group (n = 15) will receive intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells twice over a month (30 days interval), the Control Group (n = 15) will receive the same protocolized intervention with normal saline. Follow-up duration is 6 months after first intervention. The reported serious adverse events\uff08SAEs\uff09will be observed within one month post infusion. The short-item from health survey\uff08SF-36), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Fried phenotype scale will be evaluated. Short physical performance battery (SPPB) and plasm biomarkers will be assessed.The assessments will be performed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore domains of efficacy of HUC-MSCs through the reduction of signs and symptoms of aging frailty and to evaluate the safety of HUC-MSCs in subjects with aging frailty."

All subjects will receive the same dosage of stem cells via intrathecal injection. Enrolled subjects will first undergo a minor surgical procedure in which a sample of the patient's adipose tissue will be harvested from a small incision in the patient's abdomen or thigh. The subject's adipose tissue will then be used to derive and culture-expand AD-MSCs for 4-6 weeks. Autologous AD-MSCs will be transplanted through intrathecal injection at the level of L4-5 under fluoroscopic guidance at a single dose of 100 million cells. Patients will be evaluated at set intervals following the injection: day 2, day 3, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 24, weeks 48, week 72 and week 96."

                              "Cerebral palsy refers to a neurological disorder caused by a non-progressive brain injury or malformation that occurs in early childhood. It can result in central motor deficits, developmental retardation, abnormal posture, abnormal muscular strength, abnormal muscle tone and/or dysreflexia. It has a high disability rate. There is currently no effective treatment for cerebral palsy. Conventional treatments for cerebral palsy are often tiresome and expensive and have a slow onset of action. Stem cells have been recently used in the treatment of cerebral palsy. This provides a novel method for the treatment of cerebral palsy. According to the existing clinical studies, neural stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are mainly used as the seed cells for the treatment of cerebral palsy. UC-MSCs are the most promising seed cells for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of the advantages including rich sources, ease of harvesting, short doubling time, low immunogenicity, long-time survival post-transplantation, and no ethical issues. UC-MSCs have been widely used to treat Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, traumatic brain injury, aplastic anemia, and decompensated liver disease. However,only two studies, and performed only in China, are reported on the treatment of cerebral palsy with UC-MSCs. One from the Hospital 463 of PLA reported 51 patients with cerebral palsy whose symptoms had not been obviously improved after 1 year of rehabilitative treatment. These patients received intrathecal injection of UC-MSCs for three times, once a week, followed by one injection of UC-MSCs via the peripheral vein in the fourth week. Four UC-MSCs injections, once per week, were considered as one course of treatment. Activities of daily living scale score was compared between before and after treatment to evaluate efficacy. Another study is a case report from China. In this report, a combined intravenous and intrathecal injection of UC-MSCs was used to treat cerebral palsy in a 5-year-old child. 28-month follow-up results revealed that the child's gross motor function, immune function, muscle strength, and language ability improved and adverse reactions were not obvious."

UC is characterized by persistent mucosal inflammation of the colon and rectum with a chronic remitting and relapsing behavior which leaves patients on chronic immunosuppression and hospitalizations to treat the disease symptoms, but unable to cure the disease. Despite the ever-growing armamentarium of immunosuppressive medication, up to 30% of patients still require a colectomy for medically refractory disease.\n\nParticipants with medically refractory ulcerative colitis will be treated by targeted endoscopic delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected into the submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.\n\nPatients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.\n\nThere will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150 million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24 participants.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory ulcerative colitis."

Nearly 50% (approximately 3,150) of these patients develop acute GVHD (Goker et al). A fraction of these patients (approximately 870) will progress to the severe stages of the disease, Grades III-IV. It is estimated that nearly 82% of those patients with severe acute GVHD will be steroid refractory (Przepiorka et al., 1995) and of these, only 50% of steroid-refractory patients will respond to secondary and tertiary treatments (Greinix et al., 2000). Thus, roughly 350 patients each year face tremendous odds against survival. In addition, most patients who initially responded to secondary and tertiary treatments have a high risk of dying within the first year (Remberger et al., 2001; Anasetti et al., 1994). Development of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with steroid refractory, acute GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need. Participants will receive standard of care in addition to adult mesenchymal stem cells or placebo."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) is the treatment of choice for many malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders. However, this treatment is frequently complicated by acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD), wich can be associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\nSteroids are still the first line treatment for established aGVHD, with a response rate of 30-50%, and there is no established and effective therapy for severe steroid-refractory aGVHD. The outcome for patients is poor and overall survival low, with few patients alive at 2 years.\n\nIn the case of failure after corticosteroid treatment, different therapeutic options have been introduced as second or third-line strategies. In this scenario, infusion of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has emerged as an additional tool for treatment of GVHD.\n\nMSCs are non hematopoietic multipotent cells with self-renewal properties and the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues. Several lines of evidence in the past few years have confirmed the ability of theses cells differentiate into cells derived form embryonic mesoderm, such as osteocytes, adipocytes and chondroblasts. In vitro, culture-expanded MSCs express membrane antigens that can be immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The most widely accepted antigen expression pattern is cluster of differentiation (CD) 29, CD105, CD73, and CD90 positivity in 97 % of cells and minimal expression of CD45, CD34, CD3, CD14, CD19, or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR, which should be positive in less than 3 % of cells.\n\nBecause they are easy to isolate and culture and due to their differentiation potential and production of growth factors and cytokines, MSC have become ideal candidates for regenerative protocols.\n\nThe purpose of this work is conduct a study in patients with refractory and/or resistant GVHD corticosteroids treatment. It will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive the MSCs and the other group will follow the acute GVHD steroid-resistant and/or refractory treatment according to the routines of the Bone Marrow Transplantation service of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. It will be evaluated aspects of immune recovery early after MSCs infusion.\n\nMETHOD: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open label study to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatment of steroid-resistant acute GVHD with MSC. All patients with refractory and/or resistant steroids GVHD will be included after signing of free and informed consent.\n\nAfter randomization, patients will be allocated to receive conventional treatment:\n\nBasiliximab 20mg dose for adults and 10mg for children, 1 time a week or every 3 days if worsens the stage of GVHD until reaching Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or for a maximum of 4 doses, whichever comes first.\nIf after the item (1) will not obtained VGPR: Infliximab 5 to 10 mg/kg dose, 1 time a week, four weeks or even VGPR.\n\nPatients in the study group will receive two infusions of MSC per week during two weeks and 1 more MSC infusion (2 + 2 + 1 scheme).\n\nAfter 28 days, if VGPR is not obtained, crossover between groups will be allowed as well as for the patients with progressive GVHD in spit of treatment arm, before day +28. The latter group of patients, who use both treatments (MSC + Conventional treatment) before day + 28 will be analyzed separately.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived MSCs from normal BMT donors (third part) will be isolated and expanded under conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice. The quality control involves immunophenotyping, differentiation, microbiological control, mycoplasma and endotoxin tests.\n\nPatients response evaluation will be at Day + 28:\n\nComplete response: disappearance of all symptoms\nPartial response: with a decrease at least of one degree of GVHD\nVGPR: decrease to the stage I of GVHD\nStable disease: when there is a stability of the disease\nNumber and type of infection in the first 100 days after transplant\n\nThe transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, overall survival and the development of chronic GVHD or not, will also be evaluated."

Mesenchymal stem cells inhibited the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) through regulatory T cells (CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg cells) and by antagonizing the expression interleukin-1 receptor (IL1-RA). Mesenchymal stem cells significantly down-regulated pro-inflammatory factors by inhibiting the expression of IL-1, TNF and IFN-\u03b3 in lung tissue, and up-regulated anti-inflammatory factor by enhancing the expression of IL -10 and regulatory T cells, respectively, thereby dampening the inflammatory response."

Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

                              "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the leading causes of vision loss and irreversible blindness. It is stated that 1.4 million people are affected in the world and its prevalence is 1:4000. Stem cell applications are methods that are increasingly gaining importance in the field of regenerative medicine and ophthalmology. In addition to many experimental studies in retinal diseases including retinitis pigmentosa, there are also clinical studies reporting successful results on humans. The most widely used stem-cell group in current clinical practice is mesenchymal stem cells. The advantages are that they are relatively easy to obtain and do not induce severe immune responses. Clinical studies in stem cell therapies for the eye suggest that stem cells benefit the surrounding tissue by secreting support such as growth factors, and extracellular vesicles, mostly due to their trophic and paracrine effects. In intraocular applications, there has been a tendency to apply mesenchymal stem cells around/outside the eye, including subtenon and suprachoroidal application due to side effects such as retinal detachment and epiretinal membrane.\n\nOther cellular products that have been studied in animal studies and clinical research in recent years are exosomes. Exosomes are a subgroup of extracellular vesicles released from cells. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles 30-150 nm in size and carry at least one of the exosomal proteins CD63, CD9, CD81, syntenin-1 and TSG101. Exosomes are secreted from different cells in the organism and are also found in body fluids. Exosomes play a role in the transportation of biomolecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins from one cell to another and in this way, they function in genetic information transfer, and reprogramming of the opposite cell and intercellular communication. One of the sources of exosomes is mesenchymal stem cells that secrete high amount of exosomes. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been reported to have therapeutic effects, just like mesenchymal stem cells. It is thought that stem cells also exert their clinical effects through paracrine factors they secrete rather than being implanted in the tissue. However, the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stem cells has not been fully understood, and exosomes are thought to contribute to the effect. The storage and durability of exosomes may provide advantages in therapeutic applications compared to mesenchymal stem cells and may provide more immunological advantages in allogeneic applications compared to cellular treatments since they do not contain cells.\n\nOne of the sources from which mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained is Wharton jelly, which is the mesenchymal tissue of the umbilical cord. Stem cells originating from Wharton gel are a good source of stem cells due to their high differentiation capacity, high regeneration capacity, constant doubling time, high proliferation capacity, low immunogenicity, and no ethical problems due to non-invasive methods, and easy availability.\n\nThis clinical trial will enroll patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. The diagnosis of RP is made by clinical fundus examination, examinations in our clinic, and genetic analysis.\n\nAt the beginning of the study, all volunteers will undergo a full ophthalmologic examination including best-corrected visual acuity, anterior segment and fundus examination with a slit lamp, OCT (optical coherence tomography), VF (visual field), ERG (electroretinogram), mfERG (multifocal ERG), OCTA (optical coherence tomography). Retinal and choroidal thickness and ellipsoid bandwidth in OCT, MD (mean deviation) value showing sensitivity in VF, amplitude and latency times in ERG and mf-ERG, vascular density and vascular flow ratios in OCTA will be recorded.\n\nThe volunteers will be randomized into three. The 1st group will be the placebo group (45 volunteers) and 0.5 cc saline physiological saline will be applied to the subtenon space. 2nd group of patients (45 volunteers) will undergo a subtenon injection of Wharton gel-derived mesenchymal stem cell suspension. A suspension containing mesenchymal stem cell exosomes from Wharton jelly will be applied to the subtenon distance to the 3rd group of patients (45 volunteers). A single eye of each volunteer will be included. Informed consent will be obtained from the volunteers.\n\nAllogeneic human Wharton gel tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells and their exosomes will be obtained from healthy female volunteers, who is over 18 years old, under sterile conditions after HBV, HCV, HIV virus and \"Treponema Pallidum\" (VDRL) tests were performed. Cord tissue obtained from birth will be carried in a sterile transfer solution and will be processed to obtain stem cells in Erciyes University Genome and Stem Cell GMP (good manufacturing practices) certified laboratories. Exosomes will be obtained by the ultracentrifugation method in the same facility.\n\nFor injection into the subtenon distance, the conjunctiva and tenon will be opened with a small incision about 10 mm away from the lower temporal area, then 20 gauge curved subtenon cannula will be advanced parallel to the sclera and injected into the posterior subtenon area. All volunteers will be prescribed antibiotics and steroid drops after the surgical procedure.\n\nFull ophthalmological examination and examinations at the beginning of the study will be performed and recorded again on the 1st day, 1st month, 2nd month, 3rd month and 6th months of the anterior segment and fundus examination, OCT (optical coherence tomography), VF (visual field) ), ERG (electroretinogram), mfERG (multifocal ERG), OCTA (optical coherence tomography) examinations will be performed.\n\nIn addition, a questionnaire evaluating the visual functions subjectively will be administered at the 1st, 3rd and 6th-month visits. (National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire - 25 / National Eye Institute (USA) Visual Function Questionnaire ). Two masked investigators will perform analyses.\n\nPost-procedure 1st Day, 1st Month, 2nd Month, 3rd Month and 6th Month data will be compared among study groups and within groups."

                              "Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or abnormality of factor VIII. It is the most common inherited coagulation protein deficiency with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000 males. More than 75% of hemophilic patients suffer the severe type of the disease.\n\nHemophilia treatments are readily available in developed countries; however, it is estimated that 70% of people with this disease worldwide are undiagnosed or undertreated. Moreover, about 20% of hemophilia A patients develop inhibitors to treatment and consequently are difficult to treat.\n\nExogenous factor 8 replacement for hemophilia patients presents a great financial and medical challenge. The optimum therapeutic option for these patients is to provide endogenous secretion of the factor. This was proposed through liver transplantation. Liver transplantation in human and canine hemophilia A results in an increase in factor VIII levels to normal and thus cures the bleeding diathesis. Given the problems of donor availability, major operative procedure and the need for lifelong immunosuppression, cell-based therapy using isolated hepatocytes has been proposed as a promising option to treat clotting disorders. The therapeutic effectiveness of human hepatocytes transplanted under the kidney capsules of mice has been demonstrated. Transplantation of wild-type rats with deficient bilirubin conjugation after ischemia/reperfusion damage resulted in 30% decrease in serum bilirubin, the appearance of bilirubin conjugates in bile and the expression of normal glucuronyltransferase enzyme denoting that transplantation of a small number of hepatocytes can result in partial correction of functional defects.\n\nAlthough cellular transplantation of hepatocytes solves the operative risk, it has the disadvantage of difficult propagation of hepatocytes in vitro.\n\nAn alternative to hepatocyte transplantation is the use of in-vitro transdifferentiated bone marrow derived stem cells.\n\nIn the past few years, a novel option to regenerate damaged liver from bone marrow-derived cells has been proposed by many investigators. Studies showed that bone marrow cells not only differentiated into hepatic and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells but they also expressed the intact gene of the FVIII A3 domain.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells have many advantages as candidates for cellular therapy. They can be propagated in-vitro, do not evoke immune reaction as they express only human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, and have been proven to adopt hepatocyte phenotype in vitro.\n\nIn hemophilia A patients, the mother is a carrier, the father is completely normal, and the female siblings have a 50% chance of being normal or carrier. Thus, the possibility of finding an HLA-matched donor with normal FVIII activity in the family is present. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have the following advantaged over BM-HSCs:\n\nMSCs can differentiate into both hepatic and endothelial phenotypes\nMSCs do not express HLA antigens except HLA-G which caused immunosuppression, thus matching for MSC transplantation can be easier.\n\nThe hypothesis of the present study is to use allogenic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells induced to adopt hepatocyte phenotype in vitro as a cellular therapy product in hemophilia patients.\n\nDonors will be subjected to:\n\nBone marrow aspiration under local or short general anaesthesia, 40-60ml BM will be collected on heparinized syringes.\nMononuclear cell fraction will be separated using SEPAX machine (Biosafe)\nMSCs will be isolated using plastic adherence and subjected to hepatic induction using sequential fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor addition under GMP conditions.\nVerification of hepatic induction will be done using morphological, molecular and proteomic screening.\nCells will then be harvested using 0.25% trypsin, washed and suspended in sterile saline in a dose of 2 million cells per kg body weight in a final volume of 5ml and injected into the hepatic parenchyma under sonographic monitoring."

In addition significant evidence of their effectiveness and safety is valid only for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The transplantation of allogeneic stem cells is a promising direction in the modern medicine with the proven safety for different diseases. But the effectiveness of this therapy is still under research.

                              "Research Methods Study Design This study is an experimental one arm study post test only. Estimated Study Time Research estimated time would be 24 months, from May 2014 to May 2016. Sample Gaining Procedure This research is a pilot study. Samples are obtained consecutively from all source population that meet the criteria. The number of samples from each mesenchymal stem cell ( adipose, bone marrow and umbilical cord) source are three. Each samples derived from three different donors that met the inclusion criteria. For the implanation, the subjects are five from each intervention. Yet regarding the limited funding source and time, we will recruit one subject for each kind of MSC.\n\nSubject Criteria Inclusion criteria for MSC donor\n\nBone marrow donor :\n\nMale/female aged 19-30 year without any comorbiditites (Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and any other autoimmune disease), HIV test Hepatitis B test and Hepatitis C test are negaitve, no fungal and bacterial contamination in the bone marrow. Subjects are willing to be aspiratied in the iliac crest in order to get the bone marrow.\n\nAdipose donor :\n\nAdipose tissue are gained from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure. Samples of adipose are free from HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nUmbilical cord donor :\n\nUmbilical cord are form elective seccio caecaria from a fullterm mother without any complications and free from HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and no fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nRecipient inclusion criteria Critical bone defect patients aged 6-55 who are willing to undergo surgical intervention.\n\nRecipient exclusion criteria Patients with pathological fracture caused by malignancy, immunocompromised ( HIV AIDS, Diabetes mellitus, active Hepatitis), in a immunosuppresant therapy ( chemotherapy or steroids).\n\nDrop out criteria Patients are ruled out from this study if he/she stated to do so in the time this research are held or she/he undergoes any other threatment that are not related to this study. Patient who does not show any clinical improvement in three consecutive months is categorized as failed to threat. All drop out and failed to threat patient could get other threatment.\n\nInformed Consent All subjects must fill and sign in the informed consent letters.\n\nResearch Protocol Mesenchymal stem cell taking method Bone Marrow taking Patient is lying down in supine position, anesthetized locally. Aseptic and antiseptic are done in the illiac crest location. Aspiration needle is inserted 450 to horizon in illiac crest. Hub is released and a 10 cc syringe that contain heparin is connected to te needle. We aspirated about 50 cc bone marrow from each subject.\n\nUmbilical cord taking Right after the delivering the baby, the umbilical cord are cut and kept in a sterile bowl containing 0.9% NaCl in 40 until the sample is proceed.\n\nAdipose taking Adipose tissue are derived from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure. It is kept in a sterile bowl containing NaCL 0.9% in 40 C. Processing of the sample is done within 8 hours after sample are taken.\n\nCryopreservation and re activation. All the samples are taken to culture laboratory in integrated service of stem cell medical technology Cipto mangunkusumo hospita.this laboratory is GMP (good manufacturing Product) certified. The samples ate cultured in appropriated medium until it reach confluence and harvested. The cells then undergo caracterisation test by flow cyto meter and viability and numbers are counted. Some of the cells then cryopreserved while some are directly implanted into patient. The cells are cryopreserved for three months and then reactivated. Viability and numbers then are measured. The cells then are implanted to non union patient.\n\nSpecimen sterility Sterility tests are done three times to ensure there is no fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nHA-CaSO4 and MSC For every centimeter of defect, 10 millions cells and 50 pellet HA-CaSO4 are needed. The diluted MSC then mix with the HA-CaSO4 and incubated 5 minutes before implanted.\n\nIntervention Surgical intervention is needed to assemble the fixation device in the long bone. During the surgery, pellet HA-CaSO4 are inserted into the defect. After soft tissue are closed the rest of the serum is injected into the defect area.\n\nObservation and follow up Clinical and radiological follow up is done every 4 weeks. Observation is done for 12 months or untill the bone unites. Every subject will be followed up in the third, sixth, twelfth and twenty forth or until the fixation device is taken off.\n\nRecipient criteria for non union fracture"

                              "Bone Marrow Aspiration and Cell Culture Procedure\n\nUtilizing fluoroscopic guidance, a coaxial needle will be advanced to the bone marrow space. The inner portion will be removed and 10-20mL of marrow aspirated.\n\nMSCs will be isolated and cultured in the Case Western Reserve University National Center for Regenerative Medicine/Seidman Cancer Center Cellular Therapy Lab using standard operating procedures established under the ongoing IND - as above.\n\nMSC Delivery/Transplantation Procedure\n\nUtilizing fluoroscopic guidance, a needle will be advanced to the outer annulus of the affected disc(s). Through the coaxial anchor, a needle will be advanced to the middle 1/3 of the disc, and confirmed in two planes (AP and lateral).\n\nOn the day of infusion, MSCs will be transported from the Cellular Therapy Lab to the IR suite in a validated dry shipper. MSCs will be thawed in a 37\u00baC water bath and drawn into 1 ml syringes. Prior to delivery, an aliquot of the infused product will be tested for viability (trypan blue exclusion). Viability must be >70% for cell transplantation. Treatment group one will receive an injection of 1-2 ml of a 2 x 106/ml concentration solution of MSCs and treatment group 2 will 1-2 ml of a 4 x 106/ml concentration solution of MSCs. Both treatment groups will be injected under intermittent fluoroscopic observation. A manometer will be used to monitor disc pressures, especially during MSC injection keeping pressure below 100 psi. Specifically, the volume of injectate will be determined based on three dynamic factors: real time imaging of contained contrast volume during discography, psi as measured during the injection (< 100), and patient's symptoms (if patient's pain exceeds baseline, injection will be stopped) - up to a volume of 2cc of the assigned concentration.\n\nAn aliquot of infused product will be submitted to the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Microbiology Laboratory to test for microbiological contamination. In the event of a positive microbial test following administration of a cellular product: 1) The Principal Investigator and his/her designee will be notified and will notify the participant, 2) The contaminant will identified to a species level and antibiotic sensitivities determined, 3) The Medical Director of the Cellular Therapy Laboratory and/or the Principal Investigator will determine the best course of action based on the clinical situation. This may include blood cultures, administration of prophylactic antibiotics, and repeat cultures on the cell product. 4) An investigation to determine the source of the contamination will be conducted, and appropriate corrective measures will be undertaken. Finally, the adverse event will be reported to the IRB and FDA based on the respective federal and institutional reporting requirement, as well the approved data safety monitoring board charter.\n\nMRI/Quantitative MRI Procedure\n\nRoutine images of the lumbar spine (sagittal and axial T1 and T2 weighted images) will be obtained for the purposes of: Monitoring for potential alternative effects of the cells including osteophyte formation, as well as any unexpected local outcome. In addition, a quantative MRI including fingerprinting. Magnetic resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) allows rapid and simultaneous quantification of T1and T2 relaxation times. The MRF sequence is based on varying multiple MR acquisition parameters [ e.g. flip angle (FA) and time of repetition (TR)] in a pseudorandom manner, such that unique signal evolutions called \"fingerprints\" are generated for each combination of tissue properties. These fingerprints are compared with a dictionary of simulated fingerprints generated for that sequence by a pattern matching process. Once there is a pattern match, the T1 and T2 values used to generate that dictionary entry are assigned to that voxel and used to create T1 and T2 maps that are perfectly anatomically co-registered.\n\nFor spine, the proposed MRF sequence is based on a multislice Fast Imaging with Steady Precession (FISP) acquisition. Scanning will be done both in sagittal and axial planes using a multislice acquisition. The scan parameters are as follows:\n\nFOV: 400 mm, matrix 400 x 400 mm , TR/TE: 13-15 msec, in-plane resolution 1 x 1 mm, section thickness 5 mm, flip angle 5-75 degrees, acquisition time ~ 39 seconds per slice, with ~ 4 minutes scan time for a 5 slice sagittal image. In axial plane, the disc would be covered at each intervertebral level in 4-5 transverse slices and each axial acquisition would take ~ 3 minutes scan time.\n\nThe MRF maps would be directly generated as DICOM images using Gadgetron online reconstruction. Image analysis would be done using a DICOM viewing software to draw Regions of Interest (ROIs) on nucleus pulposus for direct quantification of relaxation times. There is the capacity to generate MRF maps from raw data on Matlab which can also be used to draw ROIs for simultaneous quantification of T1 and T2 relaxation times.\n\nThese values will be calculated on the pre and post treatment MRIs."

This year an estimated 700,000 Americans will suffer an acute myocardial infarction. The standard of care treatment for acute myocardial infarction (MI) usually includes immediate perfusion, optimal pain relief, oxygen, aspirin or other anti-coagulants, Beta-Blockers, nitrates and Ace-inhibitors. Management of cardiac risk factors such as tobacco use, hypertension, lipid levels, diabetes, weight control and exercise all work to reduce further atherosclerotic events. Yet, many patients go on to develop Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Medical management for CHF may improve symptoms and slow the progression to failure but does not restore a functioning myocardium. A therapy that could improve the myocardial remodeling process and reduce the incidence or severity of CHF following acute MI would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.\n\nPatients will receive standard of care in addition to stem cells or placebo."

                              "The addition of molecules or growth factors to the implant surface is an approach to enhance bone to implant contact (BIC).1 Platelet rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is an autologous concentrated platelet-rich thrombin free fibrin matrix, prepared by two step centrifugation of blood. Platelets isolated, remain intact and retain their growth factor compliment. This allows a more effective, sustained release of growth factors to the wound site following PRFM application.2 During the second spin, a cross-linking of fibrin takes place, resulting in the formation of a dense fibrin matrix, within which a concentration of viable platelets can be found. Having an organized fibrin matrix at the start of healing accelerates the speed of vascular ingress into the wound compared to non-accelerated healing, which requires a longer time for fibrin formation and the development of vascularity. The earlier the vascularity is established, faster is the migration of the bone-forming cells at the wound site and initiation of bone formation. Therapeutic applications of platelet-rich products have led to improved bone regeneration and faster titanium implant osseointegration, which improve the stability and maintenance of dental implants by increasing BIC.1 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a multipotent stromal cell with prominent regenerative functions. MSCs were first identified and isolated from bone marrow and then found in various tissues including umbilical cord, adipose tissue and peripheral blood. Among these sources peripheral blood MSCs draw increasing attention as they share similar biological characteristics with MSCs derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells(BMMSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes , fibroblasts, tenocytes, and myoblasts , which are considered as a cell source for various tissue repair and regenerating bone defects.3 The requirements of aspiration of bone marrow from the patient will cause pain and morbidity of the donor sites. It will be very convenient if peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) could be harvested and expanded to enough numbers, with their osteogenic capacity maintained in a clinical permitted period.\n\nThe literature search does not show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new modality i.e. PRFM and peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of PRFM and PBMSCs as regenerative materials for implant stability."

Chronic wound can be caused by a variety of diseases, including arterial disease, diabetes, vasculitis, venous disease and skin malignant tumor, chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a disease leading to chronic wound, Venous ulcer (VLU) of lower limbs is the advanced manifestation of CVI, and the incidence of this disease ranges from 0.4% to 1.3% in China. 60% of VLU patients' ulcer wounds heal in 3-6 months, 33% in 12 months, and 7% May be permanently unhealed. The probability of recurrence is as high as 70% in patients 3-5 months after wound healing, which not only seriously affects the health and quality of life of patients, but also causes a very heavy social medical burden. At present, the conventional treatment for VLU mainly includes drug therapy, stress therapy, wound treatment and surgical treatment, but the therapeutic effect is not ideal."

Although great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation,chronic graft-versus-host disease(cGVHD) remains an important complication that occurs in about 50% patients. The mortality of cGVHD and its complication could reach up to 50%,and cGVHD seriously influence the quality of life. At present, the first line treatment of cGVHD remains in discussion.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating GVHD after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of cGVHD remains undetermined.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded MSCs in treating patients with cGVHD."

Surgeons have begun to harvest and centrifuged bone marrow aspirate to produce bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) in hopes that the mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow aspirate can stimulate cartilage regeneration in areas of articular cartilage deficiency. This study is a first-in-human blinded randomized clinical trial using labeled BMAC cells in adults diagnosed with grade II-III Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis.\n\nThis is a single site study where 20 cases among eligible patients will be identified and randomly assigned to either the control (no calcified cartilage) or experimental (calcified cartilage removed) group. A power analysis will be performed after 20 patients to determine the total number of patients required to reach adequate power.\n\nA patient will receive an infusion of Feraheme 2 days before the procedure and a baseline MR Pelvis and knee. A nurse will be present at all times during the infusion to monitor vitals. On the day of the procedure patient will undergo harvesting of the bone marrow from the pelvis and arthroscopy procedure involving menisectomy, synovectomy and debridement. Patients in the experimental group will also undergo removal of the calcified cartilage cap. The bone marrow aspirate will be centrifuged and about 5-7 cc of BMAC injected into knee. MRIs will be done at the 2 day mark for confirmation of the labeling of the mesenchymal cells, and at the two week and 3 month mark.

Patients were excluded if they had anti-TNF \u03b1 treatment for less than six months, had no prior surgical interventions, or had a history of malignancies or immunodeficiency diseases. Pregnant patients were also excluded.\n\nMSCs in third passage 3 were cultured in T175 flasks with D-MEM F12 culture medium (Gibco) supplemented with Pen/Strep, Strep, and 10 % exosome depleted FBS(Gibco) for 48 hours at 37 \u00b0C with a CO2 concentration of 5% at and humidity of 90 % humidity. Under 5% CO2. The conditioned media of MSCs (CM) were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 400\u00d7g to eliminate suspended cells, 30 min at 2500\u00d7g to remove debris and apoptotic bodies, and then ultracentrifuged for 120 min at 100000\u00d7g (Beckman, USA). The supernatants were collected and further ultracentrifuged for 120 min at 100000\u00d7g. Then the pellets containing exosomes were dissolved in PBS.\n\nTo verify The production of MSC- derived exosomes, vesicle protein content was measured by Bradford colorimetric assay (BCA) from 100 ml of CM. The size distribution of MSC- derived exosomes were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Moreover, to assess the expression of CD9, CD63 and CD81 were confirmed with flow cytometry and western blot., FITC mouse anti-CD63 (BD Pharmingen) and PE mouse anti-CD81 (BD Pharmingen) were used as reagents. Furthermore, the morphology and size of isolated exosomes were assessed using TEM by the previously set protocol in the previous study.\n\nThe procedure was undertaken in the operation room, and the patients were NPO 6 hours before the operation with intravenous sedation and oxygen supplementation with a mask. The patients, placed were placed in a lithotomy position. The external fistula opening was inspected, the tract was palpated, and using an Eisenhammer Retractor, the internal orifice was exposed seen. The lot was irrigated with saline several times using a small catheter to clear the pus and fecal material. After irrigation, a flexible fistula probe was inserted into the tract. Using the probe as a guide, we injected 5 mL of exosome solution into the tissue surrounding the lot. The injection depth was about 2about 2-3 mm of the soft tissue and sphincters of the anus. After the injection, the tract probe was extracted, the patients were under observation in the operation recovery rooming room recovery for 3 hours, and vital signs were monitored. The patients were then transferred to the surgery ward and were observed for 48 hours. The patients were again examined under sedation in the operation room for further evaluation six months after injection."

MODS is one of the chief causes of post-operative death for acute type A aortic dissection(ATAAD) patients, and it was reported that MODS accounted for more than half of the death after surgery for ATAAD. Despite recent advance in surgical technique, mortality rate remains high in such critical care conditions.\n\nIn animal models, studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of MSCs with respect to ischemia-reperfusion injury of heart, lungs, kidney, brains and livers. Several pilot studies have provided evidence that MSC may be effective in treating critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, acute renal failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, in the present pilot study, the investigators hypothesized that timely initiation of mesenchymal stem cells(MSC) will positively influence survival and biochemical indexesof patients with MODS after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft for ATAAD. The trial contain two parts:\n\nPart one(prenvention scheme): to explore the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSC, we will recruit patients who are diagnosed with ATAAD, and 8 patients will be administrated intervenously with MSC immediately after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft while other 8 not. Then we will monitor their MODS related biochemical indexes, sequential organ failure assessment(SOFA) scores, comparing to those don't be treated with MSC.\n\nPhase two(treatment scheme): for patients presenting severe MODS(SOFA score\u226510) after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft, we will randomly use MSC to 8 of patients while other 8 not. Then we will monitor their MODS related biochemical indexes, SOFA scores, comparing to those don't be treated with MSC.\n\nThe dosage of the MSC was determined on the basis of the previous clinical studies, which is 1000000 cells per kilogram of body weight and administrated intervenously ."

                              "Aims & Objectives:\n\nThe present study describes a novel method to preserve the crestal bone at two-stage dental implants using autologous aBMMSCs, free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded into commercially available collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece) that are stabilized over the implant platform upon surgical implant placement.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nThis study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel method based on histotechnology in crestal bone preservation at two-stage dental implants, as compared to conventional surgical implant placement following the manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nSecondary, changes in the peri-implant soft tissues will be also determined between implant placement and exposure and will be compared between the experimental and the conventional surgical treatment approaches.\n\nStudy design:\n\nBiopsies will be derived from alveolar bone marrow of the alveolar bone under local anaesthesia in each patient belonging to the Experimental Group (Group-A). Briefly, after a thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill will be performed in the alveolar bone of an intraoral edentulous site other than the implant site and a 2x8 mm or 3cc approximately of an osseous core will be harvested. The area and the biopsy will be copiously irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to achieve primary closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict clinical grade expansion protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013; Bakopoulou et al. in preparation). Since MSCs will be isolated and expanded in vitro in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant clean rooms (Biohellenika facilities) meeting the quality guidelines set by the European Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for autologous transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy applications. In Biohellenika facilities, 40ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject in Group-A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the isolation and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin glue will be used to load the BM-MSCs onto a commercially available collagen fleece. At the day of the surgical placement of the implants and chairside, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched with fibrin glue) will be delivered in an insulin syringe containing 10x10E6 cells/200\u03bcl fibrin and will be gently loaded onto the collagen fleece and activated with the addition of CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex will be sutured onto the lingual flap using bioresorbable sutures (5-0 Coated VicrylTM (polyglactin 910), reverse cutting 3/8 circle - 16mm, Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and will be thus gently stabilized over the implant platform head partially covering the buccal bone. Handling of the scaffold will be done with care to avoid doing any harm to the viable cells.\n\nIn the Control Group (Group-B), the implants will be placed crestally following the manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting materials. One system of implants will be consistently used throughout the study in both groups (Osseotite, Certain, parallel wall, Biomet 3i, Palm Beach Gardens, USA).\n\nPost-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for 5 days) will be prescribed to both Groups. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine twice daily and avoid brushing and chewing hard in the treated area for two weeks. During this 2-week period, patients will be followed on a weekly basis to record uneventful healing, and after that patients will discontinue rinsing with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral hygiene. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three to four months to have their implants exposed.\n\nSubjects will be assessed at baseline (T0: surgical implant placement) and T1 (implant exposure at 3-4 months). Clinical recordings will be determined by a single calibrated examiner using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) with an endo-stop attached on it and all measurements will be digitalised using an electronic caliper. A customised metallic caliper will measure the thickness of the bone at the buccal/lingual aspects of the implant. At T0 and T1, clinical recordings will assess:\n\nThickness of mucosa at the top of the alveolar ridge and 2- and 4mm apically, on the buccal and the lingual aspects of the ridge.\nWidth of keratinized mucosa buccally and lingually of the implantation site.\nThickness of buccal and lingual bone at 0, 3- and 6mm from the implant shoulder.\nLevel of of the buccal and lingual marginal bone, in relation to the implant shoulder.\n\nStandardised digital radiographs will be collected at T0 and T1 to linearly determine changes (in mm) in the height of the alveolar bone between the implant shoulder and teh alveolar crest using the VixWin\u2122 Platinum|Gendex software.\n\nGroups will be further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical site at T0 [thin mucosa (\u22642.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (>2.5mm) for Groups-AII/-BII] and all the parameters will be determined and compared on the basis of the surgical approach and mucosa thickness at the surgical site.\n\nA linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine changes in the dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two stage-implants placed either conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex."

A run-in phase of 2 weeks will be required prior to randomization/enrollment.\n\nAll subjects will receive appropriate and standard care for chronic wounds, including dressings, bandages, and off-loading, if required. All subjects will receive either saline, fibrin or MSCs in fibrin using an identical double-barreled syringe to keep the blind. Therefore, subjects will then be randomized to one of three groups:\n\nconventional standard therapy and control saline spray\nconventional standard therapy and fibrin spray\nconventional standard therapy and MSCs (autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell)in fibrin spray\n\nScreening Visit:\n\nAll inclusion and exclusion information will be reviewed to make sure that the subject is eligible for entry into the study. The following procedures will be performed during this two week period:\n\nBiopsy - One (3 x 6 mm) biopsy will be taken from the edge of the wound for additional diagnostic tests and for culturing of cells. The second (3-4 mm) biopsy will be taken from the thigh for culturing of cells in the laboratory to assess the healing process. The thigh biopsy will then be excised by taking about 3/4 inch long by 1/4 inch wide margin from around it, and suturing it closed. The reason for this biopsy of the normal skin is so that it can be used to compare the healing process to the chronic wound.\n\nBlood Sampling - Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing to assess the overall well-being, HIV, Hepatitis B & C and if the subject is a woman able to bear children, to test for pregnancy.\n\nWound Measurements - Wound measurements will be taken to determine the size of the wound and to assess for healing.\n\nRandomization Visit:\n\nIf the wound has not reduced significantly in size, and the subject is still eligible for the study; he/she will be assigned to a study treatment. The decision as to which treatment he/she will receive will be determined by a process called randomization. Randomization is a mathematical process used to guarantee that each participant in the study has an equal chance of being assigned to any of the treatment options available.\n\nThe treatment groups that the subject may be assigned to are as follows:\n\nGroup #1 - Conventional Therapy and Control Saline Spray -The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically normal saline to the wound. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days).\n\nGroup #2 -Conventional Therapy and Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography, and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically fibrin alone to the wound. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days).\n\nGroup #3 - Conventional Therapy and Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in fibrin. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if your wound is not healed.\n\nConventional Therapy - The subject will receive standard of care and accepted conventional therapy, regardless of which of the three groups you will be randomized in. This standard of care involves the use of dressings, bandages and protective ways to increase healing of your wound.\n\nBone Marrow Aspirate - Depending on the treatment group that the subject is assigned to, they will have either a bone marrow aspirate and/or sham (imitation) aspirate performed at this visit.\n\nDay 1 Treatment Visit:\n\nAll groups will receive the study treatment that was assigned at the randomization visit. Wound measurements, clinical observations, wound dressings, adverse event reporting and photography will be performed.\n\nWeekly Follow-up Visits (Weeks 1-24):\n\nAll groups will return weekly for conventional therapy, wound measurements, clinical observations, wound dressing changes, adverse event report, and photography. Two additional study treatments will be given at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if the wound is not healed.\n\nPost-Treatment Follow-up Visit (Week 28):\n\nAll groups will return one month after 24 weeks of treatment for evaluation, wound measurements, and photography.\n\nFollow-up wound Biopsies:\n\nParticipants in all three study treatment groups will be asked to have an additional biopsy of the wound edge at Week 6. This biopsy will only be taken if the wound has not healed."

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year."

                              "Background: Fecal incontinence is a distressing condition with recurrent uncontrolled passage of fecal material. Although fecal incontinence is developed by multifactorial causes, treatments were limited in medical or surgical methods. According to the recent studies of stem cell regeneration, it is reported that human adipose-derived stem cells have plentiful capacity in muscle regeneration, which had the efficacy to treat Crohn's fistulas. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the capability of muscle regeneration of allogenic-adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ALLO-ASC) can be used to treat degenerated anal sphincter, which leads to fecal incontinence.\nPurpose:The investigators aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy in the treatment of fecal incontinence by injection of ALLO-ASC into the anal sphincter.\n\nMethod\n\nSafety test of allogenic ASCs injection In the first year, the investigators will investigate the safety of ALLO-ASC injection by a dose escalation study. Patients are sequentially enrolled into three groups, which are composed of three patients each. They are treated with an injection of ALLO-ASC to the anal sphincter for 3x107 cells/ml (group 1), 6x107 cells/ml (group 2), 9x107 cells/ml (group 3), respectively. After receiving the ALLO-ASC injection, patients will receive a physical examination, a serologic and immunologic response test (CD4/CD8) with an assessment of the Wexner score, patient satisfaction survey, WHO toxicity scale, adverse events, anorectal manometry and endorectal ultrasound at 1, 4, 8 weeks, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months in the outpatient clinic. The response of ALLO-ASC injection is assessed at 8 weeks after an injection and the most effective dose is determined among the groups.\nEfficacy test of allogenic ASCs injection In the second year, the investigators will assess the efficacy of the ALLO-ASC injection comparing the ALLO-ASC injection group and the placebo group (0.9% normal saline injection) by a randomized, open-label, single-blind design. Each group is composed of six patients. Both the clinical assessment and follow-up period are identical with the first-year protocol."

Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease. WJ-MSCs from the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy."

In these severe cases, there will be rapid respiratory system failure.\n\nMSCs have been employed extensively in cell therapy, which includes a plethora of preclinical research investigations as well as a significant number of clinical trials. Safety and efficacy have been shown in many clinical trials. Previous studies have shown that MSCs could significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect lung tissue from damage.The mechanisms underlying the improvements after MSC infusion in COVID-19 patients also appeared to be the robust antiinflammatory activity of MSCs. Recent studies also showed that intravenous MSC infusion could reduce the overactivation of the immune system and support repair by modulating the lung microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2 infection. MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells in severe patients With COVID-19.The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, immunological characteristics will be evaluated."

It is estimated that 26.9 million Americans 25 years old or older have clinical degenerative arthritis of some joints, with a higher percentage of affliction in the older population. Its clinical manifestations include joint pain and impairment to movement, and surrounding tissues are often affected with local inflammation. The etiology of degenerative arthritis is not completely understood; however, injury, age, and genetics have been considered among the risk factors.\n\nDegenerative arthritis is a progressively debilitating disease that affects mostly cartilage, with associated changes in bone. Cartilage has limited intrinsic healing and regenerative capacities.\n\nDue to the increasing incidence of degenerative arthritis and the aging population coupled with inefficient therapeutic choices, novel cartilage repair strategies are in need.\n\nThe availability of large quantities of MSCs and their potential for ready chondrogenic differentiation after prolonged in vitro expansion have made MSCs the most hopeful candidate progenitor cell source for cartilage tissue engineering.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue and cultured, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery.\n\nIt will be stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

The ultimate therapeutic goal in such cases is cardiac transplantation which is restricted by donor availability. Alternatively, left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly used as bridge to transplantation or more recently as destination therapy in non-transplant candidates. Widely used second- and third-generation continuous-flow LVAD offer symptomatic relief and prolong life. However, LV unloading rarely improves native heart function in ischemic hearts. We aim to increase myocardial viability and improve native cardiac function in patients with end-stage ICM by injecting allogeneic bone marrow stem cells at the time of LVAD implantation."

                              "Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nAlthough human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use.\n\nThe purpose of this study, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency as well as provide a clinical dose reference for the subsequent trails of aerosol inhalation of MSCs-Exo in the treatment of severe lung diseases (including severe lung infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc.)"

COVID-19 is characterized by sustained cytokines production and hyper-inflammation, can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness with a fatality rate around 2-5%. There are currently no prophylactic vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment agents available recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19.\n\nDuring the last decade, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial is needed to assess efficacy and safety.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs (4.0*10E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 30 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group.\n\nChange in lesion proportion (%) of full lung volume from baseline to day 10, day28 and 90, change in consolidation/ ground-glass lesion proportion (%) of full lung volume from baseline to day 10, 28 and 90, time to clinical improvement in 28 days, mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale, 6-minute walk test, maximum vital capacity (VCmax), Diffusing Capacity (DLCO), oxygen saturation, oxygenation index, duration of oxygen therapy, side effects, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days follow up."

                              "In recent decades, the percentage of Cesarean section (CS) deliveries has dramatically increased around the world. While it allows safe delivery in many situations, the risks of severe maternal complications associated with cesarean delivery are higher than those associated with vaginal delivery. These maternal complications include short term, long-term, the next pregnancy, and the non-pregnant state, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and postmenstrual spotting.\n\nUterine niche, also named cesarean scar defect, deficient cesarean scar, pouch, or diverticulum, is defined as a triangular anechoic structure at the site of the scar or a gap in the myometrium at the site of a previous caesarean section. It is one of the most common complications associated with previous cesarean section. The primary clinical manifestation is postmenstrual spotting, which may seriously affect the daily life of patients. The treatment includes medical treatment, such as oral contraceptives, and surgical methods, such as hysteroscopy resectoscopic correction, endometrial ablation, laparoscopic surgery, and transvaginal repair surgery. Although good outcomes are reported in each study, present treatments could not decrease the incidence among women after undergoing cesarean section.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are long-lived cells with the ability of both self-renewal and differentiation into multi-potential cells, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. Trials with MSCs in patients after myocardial infarction have shown an excellent safety and efficacy. In this trial, the investigators postulate that MSCs can reduce uterine niche and convert scar tissue to viable myometrium. To test the hypothesis, the investigators therefore undertake a Phase II clinical trial of the treatment for uterine niche among primiparous women who undergo cesarean section.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment on the caesarean section uterine scars. A total of one hundred and twenty (120) participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive direct local intramuscular injection of 1*10^7 MSCs (a dose of 1*10^7 cells in 1 ml of 0.9% saline) (MSCs group) or an identical-appearing 1ml of 0.9% saline placebo (placebo-controlled group). Cesarean procedures and care will follow usual practices. All participants will be performed by obstetricians from the investigators' department using a unified double-layer uterine closure technique with a continuous absorbable polyglycolic 1-0 suture. After suturing the uterine incision, direct local intramuscular injection will be performed in the uterine incision as soon as possible on the operating table. One ml solution will be injected as twenty aliquots of 0.05ml into each injection site on the incision. Injection sites will be selected near the incision at evenly 20 different sites. Participants will be followed up at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, the investigators will utilize an \"intention-to-treat\" study population."

                              "Trauma is the leading cause of soft tissue loss of the heel. Children constitute the largest group of victims of such injuries. Spoke wheel injury, road traffic accident are common mode in the children. These injuries can range from simple minor abrasions, lacerations to crushing of heel. Injury to heel pad and flap has serious impact in day to day life, causing disability because it is the major weight bearing area and inherently lacks adequate soft tissue.\n\nManagement of injury of heel pad in children depends on severity and extent of soft tissue injury. Oestern and Tscherne have classified soft tissue injuries into four grades from 0-4. The treatment of Grade 0 and 1 injuries is typical cleansing and application of a moist wound healing dressing. But further grades need surgical management with debridement and reconstruction.\n\nGrade III and IV can be reconstructed by using graft, flaps or various other techniques. Simple skin graft, lateral rotational skin flap, local muscle flaps, ingenious fasciocutaneous island flaps, cross-leg or cross foot flap, free tissue transfer and staged or distant jumped flaps are historically included in reconstructive ladder in repairing these soft tissue injuries. Generally, free flap reconstruction is the ultimate step of degloving wound coverage. Despite availability of various reconstructive techniques, covering of soft tissue loss of heel in traumatic events, remains a difficult and demanding procedure, especially when it is associated with fractures and complex wounds. Skin grafting offers poor functional and cosmetic results, although it is commonly performed with good take rates.\n\nStem cells are potential alternative to promote cutaneous wound healing because of its unique features like self-renewal and differentiation capacity. Mesenchymal stem cells are type of adult stem cells that reside in various tissues of the body. Besides, these cells are preferred for cell based therapies because they have immunomodulatory properties. These cells can be isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue and human umbilical cord blood and tissue. Recently,umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells have shown a tremendous potential for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Previous studies indicate that these mesenchymal stem cells can accelerate wound healing by enhanced proliferation and migration of human fibroblast, enhancing secretion of elastin, synthesizing collagen, angiogenesis and further maturing blood vessels present in wound site. Stem cell-based therapies will definitely be the major part of clinical medicine in next decade.\n\nIn the current study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord with informed consent from the mothers. This study will open a new avenue for the treatment of heel pad injury. Considering the role of stem cells in wound healing, study has been designed to accelerate the wound healing process in children with heel pad injury. Since the use of stem cell (especially in Pakistan) is completely a new technique in the management of heel pad injury, it will provide insight for better management by accelerating the wound healing process, reducing the hospital stay and cost of treatment. Rationale of our study aims to compare outcome of heel pad injury managed with skin graft with infiltration of mesenchymal stem cell Versus management with skin graft only."

                              "Aims & Objectives The present study describes a novel method to regenerate periodontal tissues in periodontal infrabony defects using autologous BM-MSCs, free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded into commercially available collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece).\n\nPrimary objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel regenerative treatment of periodontal infrabony defects using a biocomplex of BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/collagen fleece, as compared to a cell-free grafting substitute of fibrin glue/collagen fleece and to a control treatment approach of open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo document the stability of the enhanced treatment outcome and to continue to assess the safety and effectiveness of BM-MSCs transplantation as compared to the control treatment of open flap debridement over the study period.\nDetermine the immunological and microbiological profiles of the participants throughout the study period in an attempt to understand local and systemic effects of the transplantation of BM-MSCs in chronically diseased sites, such as the infrabony periodontal defect. In addition, the healing response to treatment will be determined throughout the observation period (baseline to 12-months).\n\nStudy Design\n\nInvestigational products aBM-MSCs cultures will be established from osseous biopsies derived from bone marrow of the alveolar bone in each patient belonging to Group A. Briefly, after a thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill will be performed in the alveolar bone and a 2x8 mm osseous core will be harvested. The area will be irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to achieve primary closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes containing HBSS and antibiotics/antimycotics and will be transported to a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant authorized facility meeting the quality guidelines set by the European Union for the preparation of clinical-grade stem cell cultures for delivery to the patient. aBM-MSC isolation will be performed using the enzymatic dissociation method, as previously described (Bakopoulou 2013). For culture expansion, autologous serum obtained from 60ml of venous blood collected from each subject will be used to supplement aMEM cell culture medium, in order to avoid the use of any animal derived reagents, such as bovine serum. The osseous biopsy will be immediately processed to ensure high viability of the established cultures. After expansion for two passages (approximate time needed 16-24 days depending on cell donor) cells will be harvested for delivery to the patient. For cell dissociation and passaging, highly purified, GMP compatible recombinant enzymes (Tryple, Thermo Fisher Scientific) will be used to avoid use of porcine trypsin. At this stage, a sample of 20ml venous blood will be required for the preparation of the autologous fibrin glue in Group B, as in Group A initial bloodletting (60ml) will cover the needs of the cell cultures and fibrin glue preparation. Subsequently, fibrin glue will be loaded with- (Group A) or without- (Group B) stem cells into a commercially available collagen fleece scaffold directly before clinical application.\n\nQuality control of the established BM-MSC cultures before clinical application\n\nBefore delivery to the patient, all BM-MSCs cultures will be evaluated for:\n\nViability using Trypan Blue exclusion\nSterility: cultures will be tested for potential contamination from bacteria, mycoplasma and endotoxins (LAL test)\n\"Stemness\" properties based on the minimal criteria established by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) regarding MSCs (Dominici et al 2006).\n\nNote: Methodology on stem cell characterization methods is analytically described in previous publications by our research group (Bakopoulou et al. 2013).\n\nAfter application of the BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/CaCl2 mixture into the collagen scaffolds, a small sample of the biocomplex of randomly selected cases will be separated using surgical scissors and will be transferred to the lab for further (in parallel to the clinical application) ex vivo characterization of stem cell behavior in a biomimetic microenvironment. This will allow correlation between stem cell behavior and the clinical outcome, since retrieval and analysis of the regenerated tissues directly from the host is not feasible for ethical reasons.\n\nPreparation of autologous fibrin glue Twenty ml of venous blood will be collected from the ante-cubital fossa of patients in Groups A and B and blood samples will be immediately transferred to a falcon tube, which contains anticoagulant. After determination of the platelet counts the blood sample will be centrifuged (2000rpm, 10min) and plasma will be separated and stored in another falcon. Platelets counts will be then determined and the sample will be centrifuged again. PRP (platelet rich plasma containing 1,000,000 plts/ul) will be then separated from the supernatant PPP (platelet poor plasma) and both preparations will be further processed following a standard protocol for fibrin glue preparation (Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece).\n\nDesign of the clinical arm of the study\n\nPre-selection of Subjects Subjects will be recruited from new referrals at the Department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Implant Biology; no external advertising or recruitment will be undertaken. Subjects will be in good general health.\n\nAdmission into the Study Before admission into the study, each subject will be informed by the principal investigator of the nature and risks of the study both orally and in writing (Subject Information Form) and written informed consent (Subject Informed Consent Signature Form) will be obtained. Each subject will be given a copy of their duly signed consent form to maintain for their own records. The subjects' personal demographics and medical history and study suitability in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria set in the protocol will be recorded. Subjects may continue any medications not included in the exclusion criteria; however, these medications should be documented together with any concurrent medical condition not pre-excluded.\n\nProcedures for Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation Any subject, who wishes to withdraw from the study for personal or any other reason, is entitled to do so. However, the reason for the withdrawal of any subject from the study in addition to whether the reason is related to the test product will be recorded by the principal investigator. Any participant failing to attend more than twice is removed from the study. Subjects that experience an adverse event will be excluded from further participation in the study.\n\nIf a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal. Subjects will be asked to consider giving further information as to the reason(s) for the withdrawal. Any information reported will be recorded.\n\nExpected Duration of each subject participation Each subject is expected to attend nine visits in total over a period of 12 months; one screening visit, one treatment visit to receive surgical treatment of the designated area, four follow-up reviews and three additional visits for clinical and radiographic reassessment and sample collection (whole saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), subgingival plaque).\n\nInvestigators' calibration and randomisation Patients will be screened for eligibility by one examiner and will be enrolled one at a time on a continuous basis after obtaining a code number. A trial contributor not involved in data collection will perform the randomisation and announce the treatment modality to the therapist using telephone communication. Clinical assessments will be carried out by a single examiner who will have no access to previous recordings and is not otherwise involved in other clinical procedures. An investigator calibration exercise will be performed to obtain acceptable intra-examiner reproducibility for PPD, CAL, and evaluation of defect anatomy. Intra-examiner reproducibility will be evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (Bland and Altman, 1999).\n\nStatistical analysis of experimental data The analysis will be performed using the IBM Statistics SPSS 20.0, software. Data will be expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD). Unbalances between the test and control groups that are generated by the randomisation procedures will be assessed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and the Fisher's Exact test or the Chi-Square test for categorical variables. The significance of the treatment effects on the dependent variables CAL changes, PPD changes and radiographic changes will be estimated by constructing linear mixed models using the SPSS MIXED procedure. For all analyses the statistical significance will be set at p<0.05.\n\nEthical considerations / Authorisations for stem cell cultures Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece provides state of the art facilities and labs that are operating under the strictest regulations for stem cells processing and storage.

Also the labs are certified according to ISO 9001:2008, for processing, quality control and cryopreservation of autologous cell lineages and ISO 13485:2003 for the cryopreservation system which is also an international patent of Biohellenika.\n\nClean rooms operate according to the guidelines of BSR Ingenieur-Buro with ISO 14644-5. The security levels meet all the standards ISO 27001 and the company is licensed and regulated by the Data Protection Authority.\n\nThe labs are surveyed 24 hours for air quality and equipped with Cryo-View data base System, ISBT 128 barcoding system, Temperature -Liquid N2 level, Security Alarms and two power generators.\n\nStudy Schedule Clinical design and interventions for autologous transplantation of BM-MSCs Subjects with severe chronic periodontitis will be scheduled to receive non-surgical periodontal treatment under local anaesthesia using hand and power driven instruments, in addition to motivation in periodontal care and thorough oral hygiene instructions. Subjects will be clinically reassessed six weeks after the completion of non-surgical treatment and those subjects with remaining periodontal pockets (PPD & CAL \u2265 6mm; infrabony component \u2265 3mm) and no overt signs of gingival inflammation will be screened for suitability to participate in the current study. The screening visit will include an initial full-mouth periodontal examination, intra-oral radiographic examination and fulfilment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. In case of suitability, the nature of the study will be explained in detail to all subjects and a signed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee of the Dental School, AUTh. will be obtained from each participant. Then, patients will be randomly allocated into one of the three treatment Groups (-A, -B and -C). A single defect will be treated in each patient.\n\nSubsequently, an osseous biopsy and blood samples will be collected from the participants of Group A under strict sterile conditions. Each sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013, Bakopoulou et al. in preparation). Since MSCs will be isolated and expanded in vitro in GLP-class clean rooms meeting the quality guidelines set by the European Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for autologous transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy applications. In Biohellenika facilities 60ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject in Group A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the isolation and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin glue will be used to load the BM-MSCs onto the collagen fleece. In addition, a blood sample of 20ml will be collected from subjects in Group B, in order to provide fibrin glue which will enrich the collagen fleece before surgical placement into the osseous defect. Finally, subjects in Group C will not be called for bloodletting as the infrabony defects in these individuals will be surgically managed by open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nAs part of the GLP quality control, the MSCs will be analysed for sterility and endotoxins and will be also tested for potential contamination from bacteria (BD BACTEC\u2122), mycoplasma and endotoxins (LAL test).\n\nLocal anaesthesia (1.8ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine; Lignospan special, Septodont) will be infiltrated in the buccal and lingual aspects of the involved teeth avoiding the papillae. Then, strictly intra-sulcular incisions will be performed to preserve the gingival tissues and in particular the interdental papilla associated with the bone-dental defect (Cortellini, 2012; Cortellini and Tonetti 2007). The defect will be debrided and the root will be carefully planed with the combined use of Gracey curettes and power-driven instruments (EMS Piezon\u00ae, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). Care will be taken to retain the soft-tissue wall of the defects and the osseous defect will be irrigated with saline to control bleeding.\n\nIn Group A, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched with fibrin glue) will be delivered in two insulin syringes each containing 5x10E6 cells/100\u03bcl fibrin and will be gently loaded onto the collagen fleece and polymerized with the addition of CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex will be gently packed into the defect until complete fill. Handling of the scaffold is done with care to avoid any destruction of viable cells.\n\nIn Group B, the collagen fleece enriched with fibrin glue devoid of viable cells will fill the vertical bone defect with caution. In Groups -A and -B the delivery of fibrin glue with/without viable cells will be identical, so that the therapist is blinded to the procedures.\n\nGroup C, patients will receive open flap debridement and root planing of the root surface in a similar manner as subjects in Groups -A and -B, but there will be no adjunctive use of grafting materials.\n\nThe operator will be blinded to the treatment modality (Groups -A and -B), while in Group C since no grafting materials will be used, the treatment modality will become obvious to the operator but this will take place towards the conclusion of the surgery, after the collection of clinical data. Papilla preservation techniques and minimally invasive surgical techniques will be sought in all groups, avoiding scoring the periosteum. Flaps will be repositioned and sutured using a single modified internal mattress suture (5-0 Monosyn, Braun) at the defect-associated interdental area and similar sutures will be employed to close the flaps in any other interdental areas. Two weeks post-surgery clinical observation for uneventful healing or presence of adverse tissue reaction will be performed followed by suture removal.\n\nCase series for tissue engineering In a series of cases (five) having similar inclusion/criteria as above but without going through randomisation tissue engineering is applied following the same methodology as in Group A. In theses cases, the tissue engineered construct (biocomplex) is applied to treat isolated interdental periodontal defects using a newly designed surgical technique the so-called \"closed surgical technique\". In brief, this technique entails retraction of gingival flaps in a closed manner without dissecting the soft-tissues or the interdental papilla. This technique minimises tissue trauma, postoperative discomfort and enhances soft-tissue aesthetics.\n\nPost-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for five days) will be prescribed to all participants. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine twice daily and avoid brushing, flossing and chewing hard in the treated area for four weeks. During this 4-week period, stringent post-operative supportive program care will be instituted at bi-weekly intervals, and after that patients will discontinue rinsing with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral hygiene. Interdental cleaning will commence six weeks post-surgery for all Groups. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three, six and 12 months for periodontal supportive care.\n\nClinical recordings Full-mouth and site-specific periodontal recordings including BOP; Plaque Index (presence/absence of plaque); PPD and CAL will be determined using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW) to the nearest millimetre at six sites per tooth and parallel to the long axis at four time-points; baseline, 6-, 9-, 12-months. Clinical measurements at the designated sites (infrabony defects) will be determined prior to surgery and before anaesthesia (baseline). Intra-surgical assessments will be carried out once during surgery.\n\nIntra-surgical clinical assessments The defect morphology (one-, two-, three-walls or combination) will be determined intra-surgically by the number of bone walls associated with the lesion; The distance between the cemento-enamel junction and the bottom of the defect (CEJ-BD) will be determined in mm; The distance from the CEJ to the most coronal interproximal level of the bone crest (CEJ-BC) will be determined in mm; The total defect depth: the distance between the bone crest and the bottom of the defect (BC-BD) will be determined in mm; The width of the defect width (horizontal distance between the bone crest and the root surface) will be determined in mm.\n\nIf the CEJ is not detectable due to a cervical restoration the restoration margin (RM) will serve as reference point for clinical and radiographic measurements.\n\nRadiographic evaluation Intraoral digital radiography will be utilised to determine the bone regeneration of the infrabony defects at six time points; baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months. Standardised periapical digital radiographs (RadioVisioGraphy; Trophy Radiology S.A., Paris, France) will be obtained using the long-cone paralleling technique. To standardise the exposure geometry, a customised bite-block of an elastic impression material will be adjusted on the sensor holder, stored in sealed plastic containers at room temperature and will be reused during every recall radiographic appointment.\n\nIn a similar manner as the intra-surgical assessment, the following anatomical landmarks will be defined on the x-rays: the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), the most coronal level of the alveolar bone (BC) and the apical extent of bone loss (BD). In more detail, the location of the CEJ will be identified; the most coronal area where the periodontal ligament retains an even width will be identified on the radiograph to indicate the most apical extension of bone loss. The infrabony defect will be calculated by measuring the width of the defect at the most coronal aspect and at the base; the distance between CEJ-BD and BC-BD; the distance between CEJ-BC; the angle between the vertical axis of the root and the interdental bone wall (Tonetti et al. 1993). Radiographic evaluation of bone regeneration will be defined on a high definition monitor by the same calibrated examiner who is blinded to the treatment modality and does not have access to previous recordings. Assessments will be carried out using the measurement tool for numerical measurements (VixWin\u2122 Platinum|Gendex software) with reference to a metal bar of standard length (5mm) that will be attached onto the sensor.\n\nCollection of specimens Samples will be collected in the following order at six time points; baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months.\n\n(i) Saliva Saliva will be collected prior to clinical periodontal measurements or any periodontal intervention and generally in the morning following an overnight fast during which subjects are requested not to drink (except water) or chew gum. Whole saliva samples will be obtained by expectorating into 30ml polypropylene tubes for 5 minutes.\n\n(ii) GCF Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be obtained from the buccal interdental aspects of the defects. Before GCF collection, the surfaces will be gently air dried and isolated from saliva by placing cotton rolls and using a saliva ejector. Then, supragingival plaque will be carefully removed with sterile curettes and paper strips (Periopaper, OraFlow Inc., Smithtown, NY, USA) will be placed in the periodontal pocket until mild resistance is felt for 30s. Care will be taken to avoid mechanical trauma when placing the strips and those strips contaminated with blood will be discarded. Each strip per patient will be stored in a separate 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube, and stored at -70\u00b0C. Prior to use, the proteins on the strips will be eluted into 500\u00b5l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with BSA (1% v/v).\n\n(iii) Plaque Following GCF collection, subgingival plaque will be collected from the designated site. The sampling area will be isolated from saliva, gently dried with air, and after ensuring that no supragingival plaque deposits are present two paper points will be placed for 30s into the periodontal pocket and a pooled sample will be collected. All samples will be stored in Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at -80\u00b0C before processing. Paper points will be used for the collection of microbial plaque in order to avoid mechanical disturbance of the periodontal tissues.\n\nData management The investigators must ensure that the subject's anonymity is maintained. On any study-related documentation, subjects should only be identifiable by their initials, gender, and/or subject number. Personal information (i.e. medical cards) will be kept in a separate, secure location, away from other study specific data with restricted access to the principal investigator only.\n\nInformed consent process It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to obtain in writing consent from the subject. The informed consent form will consist of two separate documents; a Subject Information Form and a Subject Informed Consent Signature Form; both documents will be approved by the Ethical committee of the Dental School, AUTh prior to the study. The subject information form will provide an adequate explanation, in native non-technical language that is understandable to the subject, of the aims, objectives, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. The principal investigator must then provide ample time for the subject to read and understand the informed consent form and to consider participation in the clinical investigation. The principal investigator and the subject must both sign and date the form before the subject can participate in the clinical investigation. Each subject will then be issued with a copy of their duly signed and dated informed consent form and any other written information."

                              "Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of liver transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm, which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.\n\nIn recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees. However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, muliticenter, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240 decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group."

                              "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (acute-on-chronic liver failure, ACLF) is a special type of rapid deterioration of liver function that occurs on the basis of cirrhosis or non-cirrhosis, which is characterized by sequential multiple organ failure and high short-term (28 days) mortality (15%). ACLF was first proposed by Jalan R and Williams R. in 2002. It is a newly discovered type of critically ill liver disease characterized by high short-term mortality after hospitalization [1]. At present, the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF is not clear, and its definition in Europe and Asia-Pacific is still controversial. However, severe systemic inflammatory response is often closely related to the cause, accompanied by single or multiple organ failure are three important characteristics of ACLF. In the past ten years, the prevalence of ACLF has increased. Due to the rapid progress of the disease and the close relationship between mortality and organ failure, there is no effective method to improve the survival rate of ACLF patients except liver transplantation. The latest literature review shows that the 28-day and 90-day mortality rates are as high as 27.8-37.6% and 40-, respectively. 51.2%[2].\n\nIn 2013, European Association for the Study of Chronic Acute Liver Failure\uff08EASL-CLIF\uff09 conducted a prospective multi-center EASL-CLIF Chronic Acute Liver Failure (CANONIC) study in 29 liver disease treatment centers in eight European countries, and proposed chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment\uff08CLIF-SOFA\uff09score is used as the clinical diagnostic criteria for alcoholic and hepatitis B virus\uff08HBV\uff09related ACLF. According to the CLIF-SOFA score, the 90-day mortality rate of ACLF patients is as high as 51%, while that of non-ACLF patients is 10% [3]. The European CANONIC study also shows that systemic inflammation is the main driving force of multiple organ failure, which is a typical pathogenesis of ACLF patients with western liver cirrhosis [4]. For another, the current Asian ACLF diagnostic criteria is the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) criteria, which reached a consensus in 2009, and the guidelines were improved in 2014, but there is still a lack of multi-center, prospective evidence-based medical evidence to support . In 2016, led by the person in charge of this project, an oriental ACLF prospective multi-center observation cohort was established in China, which included 3970 ACLF high-risk patients, filling the gap in the natural course and mortality of oriental ACLF patients, and established a 90-day oriental ACLF diagnostic criteria for mortality [5]. The person in charge of this project also explored the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF patients in areas with high prevalence of oriental HBV. The study showed that submassive hepatic necrosis is an important histological feature in ACLF patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. The systemic inflammatory response of multiple organ failure caused by parenchymal liver cells has a similar mechanism to that of western alcoholic ACLF [6]. Although the causes of ACLF type are not the same in the East and the West, the cohorts from the East and the West have confirmed the short-term high mortality rate of ACLF. Systemic inflammation, sub-large necrosis, and aseptic inflammation may all important reasons that lead to multiple organ failure and eventual death of ACLF patients.\n\nDue to the high short-term mortality of ACLF and the limited liver source for liver transplantation, exploring new methods for the treatment of ACLF is a major issue facing clinical research. Mesenchymal stem cells have great application prospects in regenerative medicine because of their strong self-renewal, low immunogenicity, non-tumorigenicity and strong immune regulation ability[7]. Many previous documents have confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells in animal models can promote liver cell regeneration, resist inflammation, regulate local microenvironment and anti-fibrosis [8-10]. Among them, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) have attracted attention of researchers because they are easily obtained from the medical waste-the umbilical cord, are not invasive, and have high expansion capabilities in vitro [11]. The possible mechanism of UC-MSC in the treatment of end-stage liver disease is that it can repair the liver. At present, there are the following opinions: \u2460 Cell rehabilitation. In the case of liver failure, MSC can differentiate into hepatocytes and play an alternative therapeutic effect. A large number of studies have shown that MSC can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in different inducing factors and culture systems in vitro, capable of storing glycogen and urea synthesis. Function; \u2461Immune regulation. Studies have shown that MSC can regulate immune cells by secreting a variety of cytokines in the body, and play an immunomodulatory effect; \u2462Anti-fibrosis. MSC can induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis or inhibit its activation, and can secrete anti-fibrotic substances such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor and matrix metallopeptidase 9\uff08MMP-9\uff09to reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix and inhibit the formation of liver fibrosis.\n\nAccording to the results of a single-center clinical trial published by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in the previous period, there were no serious adverse reactions at 6 hours and 72 weeks after intravenous infusion of MSCs. The dose was (1-6)*10^7 cells/time for 4 times, confirming the safety and effectiveness of both low-dose and high-dose treatments. Another open clinical trial of Beijing 302 Hospital used mesenchymal stem cells at a dose of 5*10^5 cells/kg (based on the patient's weight of 60kg, the dose was 3*10^7 cells/time), excluded severe ACLF patients accompanied by severe infections and other sever complications. In addition, previous pharmacokinetic tests showed that the half-life of mesenchymal stem cells in animals is 3 days.\n\nTherefore, this research plans to carry out a single-center open clinical trial to confirm the safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ACLF, and provide stronger clinical evidence for the safety of UC-MSCs in the treatment of ACLF."

                              "Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of liver transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm, which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.\n\nIn recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees. However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240 decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs (6.0\u00d710E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group."

                              "Ischemic limb disease remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world despite the development of several new therapeutic modalities. Based on experimental data demonstrating that infusion or injection of stem/progenitor cells enhances blood flow in models of cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials were initiated in 2001 to treat patients with critical limb ischemia or cardiac ischemia with circulating blood or bone marrow-derived cells. Despite all promises, pending uncertainties and practical limitations attenuate the therapeutic use of stem/progenitor cells for ischemic limb disease. The main theme and method in the current program project, based on expertise, track record, and preliminary results of PI's laboratory, is to focus on clinical studies of using allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), expanded under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), in treating ischemic limbs. This project is an integrated and coordinated effort aimed to overcome the regulation of cell product, and the barriers of preclinical and clinical studies. For the purposes, we have specially set up the core laboratory for stem/progenitor cells production and quality control in Cell Therapy Clean Room on the 9th floor of Medical Science Technology Building in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We have also completed the preclinical studies in using allogenic hypoxic mouse MSCs in treating limb ischemia. In the current project, bone marrow MSCs will be isolated from allogenic donors, expanded under hypoxic conditions using medium containing no serum or animal-derived reagents, and applies for Phase \u2160/\u2161 study in treating 18 recipients with ischemic limb diseases in three years."

                              "As biologic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial data have demonstrated, inflammation is a key driver of coronary artery atherosclerosis, which is associated with pathologic injury and dysregulation of the endothelial cells lining the luminal wall of arteries, accumulation of lipids, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, \"foam cells\", and aggregated platelets at the arterial luminal wall, resulting in plaque formation. Circulating biomarkers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of cholesterol and other traditional risk factors. Recently, a gigantic proof-ofconcept trial CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) showed that an antibody that neutralizes IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2 can reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in secondary prevention, which provides intriguing support for the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover, another agent widely used to treat inflammatory conditions, colchicine,the LoDoCo study (Low-Dose Colchicine) trial has also showed a highly significant reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events over a 3-year follow-up, which also showed promise anti-inflammation in coronary artery disease. Therefore, these studies has demonstrated beyond doubt that inflammation plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis and, more importantly, that it can be effectively modulated.\n\nHowever, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. Colchicine causes gastrointestinal distress sufficient to warrant discontinuation of the medication in over 10% of individuals, the both of which severely limits the wide range of clinical applications. Moreover, more recent clinical evidence from the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) has come to challenge the above presented clinical data. low-dose MTX, when compared with placebo, failed to reduce the adverse CV events comprising the original primary end point regarding the cardioprotective effects of MTX. Evidence suggested that the inconsistent cardioprotective effects of different anti-inflammatory agents may be a reflection of the distinct pathways targeted. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and immune disease involving multiple cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and mast cells (MCs). Thus, therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit inflammation injury.\n\nThe latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. In low-density lipoproteinreceptor knockout mice atherothrombosis models, MSC-treated mice displayed a signifcant 33% reduction in circulating LY-6C hei monocytes, a 77% reduction of serum CCL2 levels, and signifcantly affected lesion development, which was reduced by 33% in the aortic root. These lesions contained 56% less macrophages and showed a 61% reduction in T cell numbers. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-\u03b2,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) .We found WJMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI in mouse AMI models. At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC possess a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in atherosclerosis. In particular safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and other studies.\n\nGiven the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs can drive beneficial in therapy of atherosclerosis. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly assigning 300 patients with coronary artery disease to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs or placebo , to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with coronary artery disease."

                              "Primary nephrotic syndrome(PNS) is a group of clinical symptoms caused by a variety of factors, including immune,environmental, genetic, et al. Oral corticosteroids have been to be the preferred drug for the treatment of PNS, but the long-term use of glucocorticoid therapy in clinic often induces some problems such as hormone dependent and hormone resistance, as well as severe side effects which act as a threat to the patients' health. On the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in the latest evidence-based practice guidelines, Japan and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes(KDIGO) still have no high-level-evidence recommendation for the steroid resistant PNS and those patients with renal function significantly impaired. In addition, a large number of patients with proteinuria long-term not control often behave faster progression into chronic renal failure, leading to poor prognosis. What's more, patients holding the progression into 3-4 stage of chronic kidney disease with nephrotic syndrome ofen can not tolerate the conventional immunosuppressive therapy, thus cause faster progression into end-stage renal disease. There is no better treatment method for this phenomenon nowadays. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore new treatment options for the clinical disease described above.\n\nIn renal diseases, Rituximab ( RTX) is often used in the treatment of refractory nephropathy, such as hormone dependent nephrotic syndrome, hormone resistance nephrotic syndrome, frequency recurrence nephrotic syndrome, which shows exciting effects in delaying the development of the disease. An observational\u3001 multicenter\u3001 retrospective study about the therapeutic effect of RTX on adult minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) was conducted. This study confirmed that RTX is safe and effective in the treatment of adult patients with MCNS, which can be used as an alternative treatment options for MCNS patients with long-term recurrence. Whereas, whether the rituximab in the treatment of PNS (MCNS or other types of NS) combined with CKD plays the same role on delaying the progression of renal disease, there is no relevant clinical trials reported.\n\nAt present, mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) has been used as a research hotspot to repair the tissue damage of chronic kidney disease, and it also behaves certain effects. Clinical Studies about the treatment of PNS by the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or the treatment of CKD by the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells suggest that the mesenchymal stem cells can improve the patients's condition with PNS or CKD. However, cell therapy in the clinical trials in patients with CKD is rarely to be seen, and there is no definitive conclusion. Accordingly, more clinical studies are needed to assess the effectiveness, feasibility and safety of cell therapy, as well as formulating standard treatment plans.\n\nWe have accumulated 3 cases of patients with chronic kidney disease(in the 3-4 stage), accompanied with a large number of proteinuria and renal function declining rapidly, providing RTX infusion combined with mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nOf which, 3 patients had significantly reduced proteinuria, 2 cases showed different levels improvement of renal function, 1 cases kept stable renal function. There was no obvious adverse reaction and safety risk, but more clinical trials was still required. In addition, our team has carried out a project about autologous non-clearing bone marrow stem cell transplantation in the treatment of severe lupus associated with renal function impaired. This study revealed good treatment effect, which can provide some certain clinical work foundation and experience for our following research.\n\nIn summary, we intend to conduct a prospective\u3001 single-center\u3001 randomized \u3001controlled clinical study, uniting the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University together to explore the effectiveness and safety of rituximab combined with mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of PNS(CKD3-4). The purpose of this study is to seek a more targeted treatment, more precise curative effect and more feasibility treatment for PNS(CKD3-4),so as to delay or reverse the disease and improve the quality of life of patients with CKD."

Type 2 diabetes was known to be in proinflammatory state due to NF-\u043aB-dependent cytokine secretion (for example, TNF-\u03b1, IL1 and IL6), which in turn contribute to NF-\u043aB upregulation. Because RAGE expression is partly regulated by NF-\u043aB signal, the NF-\u043aB upregulation in proinflammatory state observed in type 2 diabetes may entail RAGE overactivation in this population. Therefore, the proinflammatory state and its correlation to cellular NF-\u043aB-dependent RAGE activation is noteworthy to be determined in the MSC of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the effect of proinflammation on differentiation potential and apoptosis of the MSC in type 2 diabetes remains to be elucidated."

                              "Liver transplantation is the only lifesaving intervention for patients with end-stage liver diseases. The current immunosuppressive agents reduce the incidence of acute cellular rejection; however, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term side effects of these regimens now has become a major challenge for liver transplant recipients and is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need, for example, increases in the incidence of bacterial, viral infections, nephrotoxicity with chronic renal impairment, de novo diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurotoxicity, hematological toxicity.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Current clinical trails demonstrated that the use of autologous bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) for renal transplanted patients resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function. Compared with BM-MSC, umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) may be the better choice for clinical application. One main reason is that the collection of BM-MSC from liver transplanted patients would be harmful for the patients. Moreover, the proliferative abilities of BM-MSC from patients with liver disease are deficient, whereas, UC-MSC can be obtained from discarded umbilical cords and can be produced on a larger scale. Our and other studies reported that the infusion of human UC-MSC are feasible and can improve liver function of liver fibrosis and liver failure.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the conditions in liver transplanted patients. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in liver transplanted patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus UC-MSC treatment. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus placebo. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After UC-MSC transfusion, patients are followed up at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and the evaluation of liver function recovery was performed."

And the clinical use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells has been approved by FDA. However, the results are inconsistent from both human study and animal research, it often difficult to visualize the reconstruction of the motor circuits. A separate application of DTI could not precisely reveal white matter integrity. Combining BOLD-fMRI with diffusion tensor-based tractography (DTT), to detect neural activities in the brain involved in the motor function restore and then using the two seeds method to reconstruct the nerve fibers between these connecting regions. The main aim of this study: i. To characterize and evaluate functional and anatomical changes of nerve fiber injuries after umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation with BOLD drived-DTI. ii. To determine the therapeutic efficiency of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and also the utility of the integration of BOLD-fMRI and DTI. iii. To correlate the imaging results with the electrophysiology outcomes."

                              "The devastating effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS COV-2) infection is caused by a robust cytokine storm that leads to lung tissue damage. Several studies reported a correlation between disease severity and the release of excessive proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, IL-1, IFN-\u03a5, IFN-\u03a5-induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This finding was confirmed by the high level of plasma cytokines found in most severe COVID-19 patients associated with extensive lung damage. Therefore, finding an effective therapeutic option to control the devastating cytokine storm of COVID-19 and regenerate the damaged lung is crucial.\n\nPrevious studies reported that the hypoxic condition of MSCs could enhance the release of their active soluble molecules known as Secretome-MSCs (S-MSCs), such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 that useful in alleviating inflammation. Moreover, they could also increase the expression of growth factors such as VEGF and PDGF that accelerate lung injury improvement. These active molecules could potentially serve as a biological therapeutic agent for treating the severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to recent studies, we successfully isolated the S-MSCs from their culture medium using tangential flow filtration (TFF) strategy with several molecular weight cut-off category. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities treated with S-MSCs in Indonesia."

                              "INTRODUCTION In organ transplantation the immunosuppressive drugs have dramatically improved the life of transplant recipients over the past 30 years, but two notable problems remain:drug-associated toxicities, and failure of these drugs to prevent chronic graft dysfunction and extend long-term graft survival. Given these circumstances, the scientific discussion is dominated by designing effective ways to induce transplantation tolerance. 'Transplantation tolerance' describes a state in which a donor is 'accepted' without chronic immunosuppressive therapy, while the remainder of the immune system is left intact. Thus, lack of a pathogenic response to the alloantigen is specific, and the recipient is capable of responding to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and malignancies. There is abundant evidence for active immunoregulatory mechanisms, which may operate to maintain transplant tolerance.\n\nThe problems of immunosuppressive drug toxicity could be alleviated by induction of immune tolerance.Over the last 25 years, several strategies have been used successfully to induce transplantation tolerance. Each of these has been validated in at least one rodent model, with varying degrees of success upon extension to large animals, including nonhuman primates. Very small minorities of patients, who discontinue their immunosuppression, provide rare examples of clinical transplantation tolerance. To this purpose, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusion could represent a novel tolerogenic cell therapy in kidney transplantation.\n\nHuman bone marrow stem cells, more recently referred to as MSCs, are multipotential cells that reside within the bone marrow and can differentiate into various components of the marrow microenvironment, in addition to supporting growth of hematopoietic progenitors.There is also evidence that MSCs escape the immune system, and therefore could be infused into an allogeneic host without being rejected and without requirement of conditioning regimens. Moreover, they exert an immunoregulatory activity, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. On this line, evidence is available that MSC inhibit na\u00efve T cells and lock dendritic cells (DC) into a semi-mature state, thereby favoring peripheral tolerance. It should be also pointed out that experimental in vitro evidence has shown that mouse MSCs inhibit the response of memory antigen-specific T cells to their cognate peptide. We expect that, in kidney transplant recipients, MSC infusion would allow inhibition of alloantigen-specific memory T cell response contributing to long-term graft survival. Moreover in vitro studies have documented that the CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell population increased significantly in MLR when human MSCs were present compared to controls without MSCs. These findings suggest that MSC may modulate T cell response even through a regulatory mechanism. Furthermore an immunosuppressive effect of MSCs in vivo has been shown in a baboon model, in which infusion of ex-vivo expanded matched donor or third-party MSCs delayed the time to rejection of histoincompatible skin graft. The immunomodulatory function of MSCs has been also documented in preliminary in vivo studies in humans, where cell infusion did exert preventive effects on the development of acute and chronic GVHD. Thus, although no data so far are available in human kidney transplantation, we expect that peri-transplant intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs under peripheral T-cell depletion/blockade with basiliximab and low dose RATG (as induction therapy) and the cover of low dose maintenance immunosuppressive drugs would allow to safety achieving graft tolerance in living-related kidney transplant recipients. This could be through inhibition of both na\u00efve and memory T cells, and promotion of development and activation of regulatory T cells, eventually leading to indefinite graft survival.\n\nUp to now there is no clinical study that MSC infusion has an immunomodulatory effect in patients undergoing kidney transplant. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the effectiveness and safety of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions.\n\nThe general aim of the present study is to test a cell therapy with syngeneic ex vivo expanded MSC as a strategy to induce tolerance in living-related kidney transplant recipients. MSC will be prepared accordingly to established protocols, starting from bone marrow explants of living-related recipients obtained 3-4 months before kidney transplant. From these samples, MSC will be expanded in vitro and used for the present study in patients undergoing kidney transplantation.\n\nAIMS AND STUDY DESIGN This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and biological/mechanistic effect of the systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs in living-related kidney transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test the feasibility of safely achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study. Indeed, to complement the research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a pilot efficacy study of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of biological/mechanistic tests will document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance.\n\nSpecific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).\n\nIn particular, at different time up to 12 months post transplant, the plan is the following:\n\nImmunophenotyping\n\nTo assess the effect of the treatment on absolute and percent count of circulating CD4+, CD8+ T cells (and the CD4/CD8 ratio), B cells and NK cells.\nTo examine whether changes in circulating na\u00efve and memory T cell count may occur (CD45RA/CD45RO).\nTo characterize the emergence in the circulation of T cell subpopulations with immunoregulatory phenotype (CD4+CD25highFOXP3+; CD8+CD28-, CD3-CD56bright).\n\nLymphocyte functional assays\n\nTo detect whether donor-specific hyporesponsiveness develops post-operatively by monitoring T cell activation in response to alloantigen stimulation by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), by ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma and by cell-mediated lympholysis (CML).\nTo determine whether T cell deletion/anergy develops by repeating T cell stimulation in MLR and in IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the presence of high doses of IL-2.\nTo monitor the regulatory properties of T cells circulating in the peripheral blood by in vitro proliferative assay, in particular of CD4+CD25high, CD8+CD28- T cells, and CD56bright NK cells.\n\nUrinary FOXP3 messenger RNA\n\na)To evaluate whether measurement in urinary cells of mRNA level for FoxP3, a functional factor for regulatory T lymphocytes, may provide insight into the immunologic events within the renal allograft.\n\nIn addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated.\n\nShould this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow. The criteria to document the development of a pro-tolerogenic microenvironment (at 12 months post-kidney transplant) are the followings:\n\nPercentage of inhibition of memory T cell response (by IFN-gamma ELISPOT) and/or na\u00efve T cell response (by MLR) versus donor antigens higher than 15-20% in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the immunosuppressive therapy alone, in the context of normal immune responses versus third party antigens, mitogens (PHA) and recall antigens (mumps, pertussis).\n\nand\n\nInduction of donor-reactive T cell anergy in a percentage higher than 15-20% in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to those given the immunosuppressive therapy alone (evaluated by addition of high dose IL-2 in ELISPOT assay) or\nAppearance in the peripheral blood of regulatory T cells in a percentage higher than 80% in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the immunosuppressive therapy alone and reversal of the inhibition of donor-specific immune response (evaluated by depletion of specific regulatory cells in ELISPOT and/or MLR assays) in a percentage higher than 50% in MSC-treated as compared with non MSC-treated patients.\n\nWe have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the study. This will be when the patients fulfill all the criteria to enter the waiting list for kidney transplant from living donor.\n\nThe first patient will receive a single i.v infusion of syngeneic MSC (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight). If the procedure is safe and no major adverse events related to the i.v cell infusion will occur within the first month (early peri-infusion side effects, severe infections possibly due to over-immunosuppression), the second patients will be enrolled. Should the procedure be safe also in this case, the third kidney transplant patient will be enrolled and undergo syngeneic MSC infusion.\n\nTo complement this research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a pilot efficacy study of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of biological/mechanistic tests (at 12 months post-transplant) will document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, as higher inhibition of donor specific memory T cells and/or higher generation of alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells than the drug immunosuppressive treatment alone.\n\nIn this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design."

                              "Musculoskeletal diseases are growing in the Norwegian population and are currently the largest group of the chronic diseases (31%). Musculoskeletal diseases are the largest cause of disability on the working part of our population (49%). The most frequent problems are rheumatism, osteoarthritis and unspecific back pain. The most common known etiology is traumatic events towards the joint. Often, the degenerative development starts with a small injury to the cartilage on weightbearing surface of the joint. This leads to changes in the surrounding cartilage, indicative of degenerative joint disease or arthrosis. When the injured area becomes larger than 2 cm2, the patients seem to experience pain. Our group has shown that 11% of patients, who underwent an arthroscopy for knee pain, had a cartilage injury on weightbearing surface with depth down to bone (grade IV) (Aroen et al.).Unfortunately, articular cartilage shows a very limited capacity of healing. Several surgical techniques have been developed to fill the cartilage defects, but so far none of them have been able to produce normal cartilage Chondrocyte implantation techniques are at date the most popular treatment, but have not demonstrated their superiority to other cartilage repair techniques. Some clinical randomised studies exist though a more thorough review of the cartilage repair methods in a study by Jakobsen and coauthors verified that no conclusion could be made considering treatment options for articular cartilage injury (Jakobsen, Engebretsen, and Slauterbeck). Although the natural history of these lesions is not finally outlined it is clear that for some patients the disruption of the cartilage surface imposes disability especially for the young athlete. The clinical studies report a significant improvement from the preoperative status although full knee function is not obtained with either of the techniques available today (Bentley et al.;Brittberg et al.;Horas et al.;Knutsen et al.). The expected Lysholm score of 80 and the standard deviation tends to be large or is not reported which illustrating the considerable variation and that full knee function is not obtained (Peterson et al.).The impact of disrupting the cartilage surface to obtain chondrocytes for culturing has not gained much attention in the clinical studies using this repair method. However it is reported that adverse effects exist as a result of this harvesting of chondrocytes for culturing (Whittaker et al.). Whittaker and coauthors observed that the harvesting of chondrocytes for cell culturing and subsequent implantation in talus resulted in a mean 15 points reduction in Lysholm score in 7 out of 10 patients. Furthermore, additional even in the best hands a mean Lysholm score of 79 are obtained for a single lesion at the femoral condyle (Peterson et al.). Even though the new scaffolds seem to reduce the rate of reoperation as a result of graft hypertrophy from 21 % to 9 %, the harvesting procedure of cartilage may still contribute to the suboptimal by this approach (Bartlett et al.;Gooding et al.). Consequently, there is a need for a better causing less morbidity when harvesting. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent an alternative cell source with the potential of generating hyaline cartilage without the same adverse effects. In addition with MSC more cells will be available for culturing with the potential of treatment of larger lesions possible. Furthermore, the repair potential of mesenchymal stem cells is not expected to decrease with age indicating that also the aging athlete may benefit from a procedure based on cartilage repair with this cell source (Dressler, Butler, and Boivin). The use of mesenchymal stem cell aspirate from the iliaca crest under a periosteum flap support the view that this might be an option to treat knee cartilage defects with success, although this study also has periosteum hypertrophy as a side effect in one of the patients (Slynarski, Deszczynski, and Karpinski). The beneficial effects of this therapy has also been reported in other studies both clinical and experimental ones (Takagi et al.;Wakitani et al.;Wakitani et al.;Wakitani et al.). Thus, the current project will investigate if the similar results can be obtained with mesenchymal stem cells as with chondrocytes both delivered in a commercial available scaffold in clinical trial with patients eligible for the current treatment options."

                              "The chronic kidney disease is caused by renal structural and functional impairment for more than 3 months due to various causes, including normal and abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), abnormal blood, urine, and imaging findings, or an unexplained decline in GFR (<60 ml/min). Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. The incidence of CKD and the primary causative factors vary from country to country and region, and the idemiological survey led by Peking University Hospital shows that the prevalence of CKD in China is 10.8% , the primary causative factor is glomerulonephritis, but as the incidence of hypertension and diabetes rises year by year, and the world will have more than 10 million people a year have acute kidney injury, the proportion of chronic kidney disease in the long-term course of the above population will be much higher than the normal population, chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.\n\nSummarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.\n\nCurrent treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. The presence of the above complications will reduce the service life of the patient's dialysis pathway while also causing blows to other organ systems. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier, and the average survival of transplanted kidneys is currently 12 years calculated by the American National Kidney Foundation, during this period, patients need to take anti-rejection drugs uninterruptedly, and these drugs (such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.) can also greatly damage the kidney organs and function. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease.\n\nProgression in chronic kidney disease includes tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis:\n\n1) Tubular interstitial fibrosis is mainly characterized by tubular hypermetabolism, tubular epithelial-interstitial transition, and hypoxic damage to the renal interstitium, which eventually leads to infiltration of inflammatory cells, abnormal increase in extracellular matrix components in renal tissue, and disappearance of parenchymal cells. 2)Glomerulosclerosis is the outcome of excessive response of glomerular constituent related cells to injury, including structural changes, cells' gradual atrophy, shedding, apoptosis of cells, loss of anticoagulant properties, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pro-fibrosis factors; Proliferation of mesangial cells, mesangial differentiation into myofibroblasts, causing collagen III to be deposited in the renal units, leading to irreversible hardening of the glomeruli; The number of pinus process cells decreases, the skeleton retracts or flattens, and inflammatory cell aggregation of chemokines is released, while synthetic cytokines and growth factors further aggravate globules capillary sclerosis.\n\nBoth pathophysiological abnormalities are characterized by parenchymal cell loss and activation of the inflammatory immune response. However, due to the weak regenerative capacity of renal tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells, foot process cells even lack regenerative ability, these renal parenchymal cells are difficult to repair themselves once damaged, and the kidney lacks stem/progenitor cells, which cannot achieve stem/progenitor cell differentiation and regeneration. Therefore, after severe kidney damage, the existing treatment methods cannot promote the complete repair of the kidneys, often resulting in the delay of kidney disease, which is also the main reason why chronic kidney disease has become the highest incidence of chronic disease in humans.\n\nMSCs are only briefly present in the renal vascular system, and Togel F, Hu Z et al. found that their presence was not detected within the renal parenchyma after 3 days of MSC infusion, and in general, stem cells were only briefly present in the blood vessels of the kidneys and could not colonize for long periods of time7. Studies such as Camila Eleuterio Rodrigues found that gene expression in the kidneys of MSC-treated rats showed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in several growth factors with pro-mitosis, pro-survival, and anti-apoptosis effects8. There is a large body of research evidence that MSCs modulate the immune response primarily through paracrine/endocrine nutritional growth factors and ultimately promote renal repair.1)Stem cells secrete immunomodulatory correlates;2) Stem cell secretion promotes renal vascular formation and tubular cell regeneration related factors;3)MSC may also reduce renal fibrosis and structural remodeling through immunomodulation;4)Stem cell secretion improves matrix metabolism-related factors.\n\nmesenchymal stem cell therapy has a good safety record, there is no obvious toxic side effects for patients, a small number of patients have injection of local discomfort, transient low-grade fever, etc., generally do not need special treatment, patients will recover naturally, long-term observation has not found that patients have increased microbial infections and the carcinogenicity of Mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nCharacteristics and advantages of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs isolated from umbilical cord tissue, not only maintain the biological characteristics of MSCs, but also have the following advantages compared to other tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells: 1) Convenient materials, which is waste utilization. 2) The process is less invasive to the donor than the extraction of bone marrow MSCs. 3) The isolated cell content and proliferation ability are better than bone marrow MSCs, and the immunogenicity is lower than that of bone marrow MSCs, which is not easy to trigger the immune response or cause graft-versus-host disease. 4) The differentiation potential is stronger, and differentiation can be carried out in multiple directions. 5) Stronger ability to secrete cytokines and may have a stronger paracrine (exosome) repair effect. 6) Compared with bone marrow MSCs, the results of gene lineage comparison show that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells can express more genes and proteins related to matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, which is more suitable in the field of nephropathy treatment.\n\nTherefore, in the field of nephropathy treatment, umbilical cord MSC has greater potential for application.\n\nThis study was a prospective, single center, randomized controlled and double-blind study, total duration 36 months, of which each patient study cycle is 13 months, and long-term safety follow-up is 12 months after the end of the study. It is grouped by the random number table method, divided into the experimental group and the control group according to the ratio of 1:1, 22 people were required in the experimental group and 22 people in the control group, for a total of 44 people. Experimental group will receive UC-MSC, while the control group will receive saline solution. The expected effect is UC-MSC can delay the progression of renal function in patients with brady nephropathy,reduced or alleviated chronic kidney disease-related complications (e.g., anemia, hypertension)."

                              "Symptoms of Peyronie's disease include penile pain and curvature of the penis that prevents penetration and/or causes erectile dysfunction (ED). It is characterized by plaques that form along the top or bottom side of the penis inside the tunica albuginea; the plaque begins as a localized inflammation then develops into a hardened scar. Cases can range from mild to severe. In several cases, the hardened plaque reduces flexibility, causing the penis to curve during erection. The sexual problems as a result can lower a man's self-esteem and interfere with a couple's physical and emotional relationship.\n\nThe cause is unknown; however, possibilities include trauma, inherited conditions, Vitamin E deficiency, diabetes, and vascular disease.\n\nConservative treatments used in the acute phase (initial onset of symptoms) include oral therapies. Vitamin E and antioxidants can decrease the build-up of harmful chemicals that can cause injury to tissue. It is often used as the traditional treatment; it is inexpensive and with proper dosing, there are minimal side effects. Other oral agents include Potaba (aminobenzoates potassium); however, it is expensive ($1000 per year) and has associated gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nOther therapies involve injections directly in the plaques (intralesional) with chemicals such as collagenase or calcium-channel blockers.\n\nSurgical therapies are offered once the disease is stable (symptoms present for one year). Invasive surgical options consist of correction of the penile curvature or the placement of a penile prosthesis to straighten the penis to allow for erections.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for a variety of medical treatments to repair and regenerate acute and chronically damaged tissues. These cells have the potential to repair human tissue by forming cells of mesenchymal origin, such as cartilage, bone, fat, muscle, and blood vessels. Most research has focused on bone marrow derived stem cells (BMC) however the process for harvesting the cells is invasive, painful, and yields a low cell count. The human placenta offers an alternative source form MSCs. Placental Matrix-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (PMD-MSCs) are compromised of a novel cellular repair matrix derived from placental mesenchyme. Mesenchyme is the meshwork of embryonic connective tissue in the mesoderm, from which are formed the muscular and connective tissues of the body and also the blood vessels. PMD-MSCs provide the extracellular matrix viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that coordinate the tissue repair process, regenerative growth factors, and anti-inflammatory cytokines required to regenerate the damaged vasculature of the penile corpora.\n\nThe research proposed here will establish the safety and feasibility of utilizing intracavernosal, intralesional injections of PMD-MSCs to treat Peyronie's disease with the intent of avoiding surgery."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many hematologic diseases. However, poor graft function (PGF) is an important complication after allo-HSCT that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or second transplantation, but these methods are associated with dismal effect or even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs might be effective in the treatment of PGF.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF is unsatisfactory in our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF after allo-HSCT."

                              "There are about 1.7 billion people with different types of chronic liver diseases in the world, of which about 240 million are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and about 15%-40% of chronic hepatitis B can develop into liver cirrhosis and die of liver hardness every year There are hundreds of thousands of patients. There are about 90 million hepatitis B carriers in China, including about 20 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Every year, about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated liver cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. From the progression of liver fibrosis to the decompensation of liver cirrhosis, liver failure often occurs. Statistics show that slow increase The 28-day mortality rate of patients with acute liver failure of grade 1, 2 and 3 is as high as 22%, 32% and 77%. The 90-day mortality rate was 41%, 73%, 95%. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the most effective means to treat decompensated liver failure due to liver cirrhosis, However, the shortage of donor liver, immune rejection and high cost have become treatment obstacles. Application of artificial liver support system for blood flow Plasma replacement can remove toxic substances from blood, but it can't supplement albumin and coagulation factors, and it is important to whether reducing the mortality rate is still controversial. Therefore, it reverses or delays the process of liver cirrhosis and reduces the compensatory stage of liver cirrhosis It is an important link in the treatment of liver diseases that the patients develop into decompensated stage The curative effect of medical treatment on hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory period) is very limited; Liver transplantation is difficult to popularize in clinical application due to the lack of donors and high cost. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are derived from mesoderm in early development, is a high degree of self-renewal ability, Pluripotent stem cells with high proliferation ability and multidirectional differentiation potential widely exist in bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, and other tissues. They can be cultured and expanded in vitro, and can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, cartilage tissues, nerve cells, hepatocytes and so on under the control of specific conditions, which has great application value in cell therapy and tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory stage). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group, with 10 cases in each group, a total of 20 cases. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, namely, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with stem cells based on conventional medical treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of patients were observed in detail within 24 weeks after treatment, and the long-term effect of stem cell therapy was observed after 96 weeks of treatment."

As of 24:00 on January 26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients . MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model .\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficiency of MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This multi-center trial will recruit 20 patients. 10 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (3 times) of 3.0*10E7 cells of MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 10 patients received conventional treatment were used as control. The clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 180 days follow up."

                              "Supraspinatus tendon tear is the most common factor causing shoulder pain, mainly resulting in discomfort and functional deficit in individuals over the age of 35. Supraspinatus tendon repair surgery represents one of the most widely performed types of orthopedic operation. Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding tendon-to-bone healing during the postoperative period. Despite advancements in surgical technique, re-tear of a previously repaired supraspinatus tendon is a fairly common complication, especially in a larger size tear. Such repair technique employing suture anchor devices alone has not yet produced functional results demonstrating both anatomical and biomechanical properties. Therefore, tendon tissue engineering using a combination of scaffolds, cells, and growth factors stimulation offers a potential solution as a biological augmentation in tendon repair.\n\nHuman amniotic membrane (HAM) has been widely used as a natural scaffold in tissue engineering due to many of its unique properties such as providing growth factors, cytokines and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, adequate mechanical strength, and biocompatibility. Whereas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) constitute one of the adult stem cells that promote replacement and repair of damaged tissue along with normal tissue turnover. These MSCs are seeded to the HAM scaffolds to biologically augment tendon repair, with MSCs acting as cytokines/growth factors to stimulate tissue repair. This approach serves as the foundation to conduct the present study. The investigators aim to investigate the efficacy of using allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs and human amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM) composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation."

                              "Contour deformities of the face requiring soft tissue augmentation often result from conditions such as congenital disorders, acquired diseases, and traumatic and developmental deformities. Significant contour deformity of face causes both functional as well as aesthetic problems for the patient. Conventionally, these problems are treated by allogenic fillers, major flap surgery and fat grafting.1 However; different problems are associated with above mentioned treatment options. For example, allogenic fillers are foreign material that poses not only allergic reactions but also rapid absorption at the site of application. Similarly, flap surgery, in the form of pedicled and free flaps, produces considerable donor site morbidity. In addition, fine- tuning is impossible with flap, and tissue transferred in the form of flap may act as blob.\n\nAutologous fat grafting has gained pervasive acceptance for the management of contour deformities of the face. Fat being an autologous tissue source is considered as an ideal soft-tissue filler because it is abundant, readily available, inexpensive, host compatible, and can be harvested easily and repeatedly.2 Although the practice of fat grafting is not new and it is a safe and natural method of soft-tissue augmentation, the viability and reliability of transplanted fat grafts remains poorly studied. One major concern is the lack of consistency of final clinical outcome, which often requires multiple fat grafting procedures making it expensive. Rate of fat absorption may reach up to 40% to 80%.However, previously published data have failed to produce a cohesive algorithm of the required components for successful, consistent and durable fat transplantation.3 In order to overcome problems associated with fat grafting, other innovative techniques are required.\n\nThe role of fat auto-transplantation in plastic surgery has evolved from a controversial technique designed for simple volume augmentation to the foundation for the innovative and burgeoning field of regenerative medicine. This is based on the fact that adipose tissue contains adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) consisting of multiple cell types such as circulating blood cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Adipocytes account for 20 percent or fewer of the total number of cells in adipose tissue4whereasthere are only 3% MSCs in SVF of adipose tissue.5 Although this percentage is relatively low, this cell type is the main contributor in overall healing process. MSCs derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) have high proliferative potential and ability to differentiate into mesenchymal (adipose, bone, cartilage) and non-mesenchymal (neuron like cells) lineages.6,7,8 AT-MSCs have been shown to enhance angiogenesis, decrease apoptosis and modify the local inflammatory response owing to their immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory properties.9 Therefore, the current study is designed to evaluate the effect of fat grafting and AT-MSCs together on contour deformities of face. By combining traditional fat graft with AT-MSCs, tissue viability and therefore the consistency of graft survival may be improved. In the current model investigators propose that transferred fat may act as a natural scaffold and temporary filler to restore the volume immediately while AT-MSCs will start participating in multiple parameters of tissue regeneration. This model supports the \"host replacement theory\" that has been put forward to describe how fat grafts survive after they are transplanted.10 Due to problems associated with fat grafting alone, it is desirable to solve such issues by using innovating techniques. In the current study investigators propose the novel idea of enrichment of conventional fat graft with ex-vivo expanded AT-MSCs to enhance the viability of the grafted fat and the reliability of the final outcome of surgery. Recent animal studies have suggested that AT-MSCs that have been expanded before administration could help preserve grafted fat and improve outcomes.11 Thus rationale of current study is to compare the outcome of conventional fat grafting with stem cell enriched fat grafting for contour deformities of face. If enrichment of fat graft with AT-MSCs can decrease its absorption rate, this innovative strategy can make fat transfer a reliable option for soft tissue augmentation. This can definitely improve final clinical outcome at lesser cost and reduced donor site morbidity"

                              "This study is a prospective cohort clinical study, of tissue grafts containing nucleated adult derived autologous or allograft mesenchymal stem cells delivered via intra-discal or intra-facet injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to either lumbar degenerative disk disease or degenerative facet disease at one to five lumbar levels from L1 to S1 in patients who have been unresponsive to conservative therapy. A second cohort evaluating the development of adjacent segment disease in the lumbar disk and facet joints after nucleated adult mesenchymal stem cells are delivered via intra-discal or intra-facet injections during surgical treatment of adjacent levels for degenerative pathology in the spine. Traditionally, treatment of degenerative spinal conditions has focused on the reconstruction of damaged tissues within the motion segments of the spine. However, biologic treatment of degenerated spinal components should address the etiology of the disease process as opposed to reacting to symptomatology. Strategies to induce a reparative response within the disk and facet joint focus on rebuilding the chondrocyte population and inducing their production of healthy biomechanical extracellular matrix.. Current models to induce a reparative response include; injection of proteins to stimulate proteoglycan production or inhibit the inflammatory response; transfer of genetic material to cells within the dammed structures; engineering of newly formed tissues ex-vivo for implantation; and finally repopulation of the damaged tissues with cells that can repair the injured structures. Subjects who meet strict inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study for injection of allograft or autologous tissue grafting that includes mesenchymal stem cells into their degenerative lumbar spine and followed for a minimum of 2 years for efficacy and adverse events. This is a prospective clinical study cohort comparing allograft to autograft cellular tissue graft injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to either lumbar degenerative disk disease or degenerative facet disease at one to five lumbar levels from L1 to S1 in patients who have been unresponsive to conservative therapy for at least 3 months.Pre-treatment imaging criteria including Pfirmann Lumbar disk Scores and/or Fujiwara Facet Joint Scores will be noted during the screening visits. After the screening and treatment visits, each subject will be evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and again at 3, 6, 12, 24 months after injection.\n\nMRI scanning will be performed at the 6 month post-procedure visit and Pfirmann or Fujiwara Scores will be calculated along with notation of adjacent level disease, epidural pathology (i.e. new disk herniations), or new imaging findings. Patients will be given informed consent to participate the individual treatment they are to receive. This informed consent will follow US FDA guidelines detailed in ICH E6 Section 4.8 of the US Department of Health and Human Services Center for Drug/Biologics Evaluation and Research. At completion of enrollment patients will have surgical sterile preparation and draping. All JCAHO Surgical Care Improvement Project protocols including pre-operative antibiotics will be adhered to. The disk or facet joint of interest will be verified by fluoroscopy and will be sterilely cannulated with an 21 to 11G needle based on anatomic requirements. At this point injection of FDA approved allograft or autograft mesenchymal stem cells within a demineralized bone matrix or hyalouronic acid carrier respectively will be injected in to the facet joint or disk space. Needle will be removed and sterile dressing will be placed. Patients will be placed in a post operative brace for stabilization of the index level to aid in healing. Patients will be discharged home once standard outpatient discharge criteria are met per JCAHO guidelines. Follow up periods will be adhered to as noted above. Patient safety will be strictly monitored in the pre-procedure, peri-procedure, and post-procedure periods for a minimum of 2 years. All patients will be assigned to a follow up surgeon at specific follow up periods and no patients will be denied any care during that period. Physical examination will be documented at each visit. Additionally, scheduled imaging studies will be performed throughout the study period to follow safety. Patients will be followed by their surgical investigator, who will be responsible for diagnosis and management of any complications or adverse events. Development of additional non-spinal disease processes will also be documented to follow any trends that occur including any new related or un-related diseases. Safety of patient confidentiality is an additional study related risk, which will be optimized to the fullest by adhering to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as defined by the US FDA will be reported immediately to the IRB for evaluation. A SAE is classified as an adverse event that results in hospital admission or hospital stay, or alteration of the body in a permanent way. Surgeon investigators will provide pre-operative, peri-operative, and post-operative care for all subjects.\n\nPre-operative, peri-operative, and post operative data will be collected. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 2 years within the US or Canada with a study investigator for data collection at 2 weeks (\u00b11 wk), 6 weeks (\u00b12 wks), and 3 months (\u00b12 wks), 6 months (\u00b11 mo), 9 months (\u00b1 1.5 months), 12 months (\u00b12 mos), and 24 months (\u00b12 mos). Data may be entered as at additional time points as needed. Re-admission, re-injection, and additional hospital/outpatient events will be collected including possible additional surgical procedures. Data will be managed by the investigator or their designee in a computerized database accessible only by research staff with original information kept with the patient medical record in the hospital or follow up sub-investigator office. Comparative statistical analysis will be performed prior to any publication to validate data and conclusions. Study staff and the Principle Investigator (PI) agree to conduct the study(ies) in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s) and will only make changes in a protocol after notifying the sponsor, except when necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects. The PI agrees to personally conduct or supervise the described investigation(s). The PI agrees to inform any patients, or any persons used as controls, when drugs or devices are being used for investigational purposes and the PI will ensure that the requirements relating to obtaining informed consent in US 21 CFR Part 50 and institutional review board (IRB) review and approval in US 21 CFR Part 56 are met. The PI agrees to report to the sponsor adverse experiences that occur in the course of the investigation(s) in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.64. The PI understands the potential risks and side effects of all treatments, investigational and standard of care. The PI agrees to ensure that all associates, colleagues, and employees assisting in the conduct of the study(ies) are informed about their obligations in meeting the above commitments. The PI agrees to maintain adequate and accurate records in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.62 and to make those records available for inspection in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.68 if the study is applied and accepted for US FDA review. The PI will ensure that the IRB complies with the requirements of US 21 CFR Part 56 will be responsible for the initial and continuing review and approval of the clinical investigation. The PI also agrees to promptly report to the IRB all changes in the research activity and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others. Additionally, the PI will not make any changes in the research without IRB approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects. The PI agrees to comply with all other requirements regarding the obligations of clinical investigators and all other pertinent requirements in US 21 CFR Part 312. Medical Ethics are of primary importance during a study of that exposes humans to a new treatment. The scientific merit of the study protocol, potential social value of the research, skill and experience of the investigators, and potential financial exploitation of the study subjects are all of paramount concern. Thus, in addition to abiding by the US FDA Quality Assurance Policy (Form 1572), the World Health Organization's \"Declaration of Helsinki\" involving the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects will be abided by throughout the trial. Finally, as this study involves subjects that reside within the United States, the investigators in this trial will also abide by Title 45 Part 46 of the Code of [US] Federal Regulations, Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46)."

                              "Ischemic heart failure (IHF) secondary to myocardial infarction is a common, lethal, disabling, and expensive condition. Despite advances over the last 30 years, the prognosis of patients with IHF remains poor. At present, there has been increasing interest in attempting to repair the failing heart with the use of stem cells, since this approach has the potential to regenerate dead myocardium and thus alleviate the underlying cause of IHF.\n\nA very primitive population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been isolated from a continuum from the sub-amnion to perivascular region of umbilical cord, referred to as Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). WJMSCs retain a combination of most of their embryonic stem cell (ESC) and MSC markers in primary culture and early passages, thus retaining their multipotent stem cell characteristics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that WJMSCs can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and to integrate into the vasculature and ischemic cardiac tissue, as well as to improve heart function significantly. Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with ischemic heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary or intravenous infusion of WJMSCs or placebo, to investigate the therapeutic safety and efficacy of WJMSCs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy."

                              "Orthobiologics have recently become a mainstay in treating bony defects whether related to trauma, tumor, or other various reconstructive entities.1 Historically, benign bone growths that were excised, would be filled with either cement, autograft bone, or allograft substances. More recently, other substances have been utilized. These substances carry any or all osteoinductive, osteoconductive, or osteogenic properties. Various materials have been used to fill bony voids specifically related to benign bone growths. Trinity\u2122 by Blackstone Medical inc. is an allograft substance that has recently began utilization. The difference in Trinity compared to various other allografts is that it utilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) along with an allograft carrier to incorporate and induce bone formation. Previously, in order for stem cells to be included in grafting, it would require bone marrow aspiration and the morbidity that is associated with iliac crest bone grafting.\n\nTrinity MSC's are pre-immunodepleted and therefore, do not stimulate local T-cell proliferation but instead are activated to act as osteoblasts and stimulate bone formation. This local response, could accelerate healing, earlier weight-bearing, healing, and filing of bone voids in patients that have had excision of bony masses. In previous animal models, the use of MSC's have been shown to increase bone healing in critical sized defects.\n\nTrinity is currently approved for FDA use in bone defects specifically within the spine or trauma. It has not been shown to have any significant adverse events over standard bone substitute products. We hypothesize benign bone lesions that undergo curettage and filling with Trinity will heal faster than bone lesions filled with basic bone grafting."

                              "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary insufficiency eventually resulting in death. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and non-productive cough, often accompanied by digital clubbing. Due to the insidious onset of symptoms, however, most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after significant fibrosis has occurred. Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia, \"dry\" inspiratory crackles on auscultation, and occasional digital clubbing (6). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) usually reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and six-minute walk distances. Diagnosis is established by the pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia (with sub epithelial fibroblastic foci) by open lung biopsy (7), and/or by high resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrating the characteristic findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular changes with fibrosis, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis (8, 9).\n\nThe prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is uniformly poor. The natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline interspersed with \"exacerbations\" or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal (5). There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and thus no standard of care. In cases of patients under the age of 60 with limited comorbid disease, lung transplant may be offered. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) receive empiric treatment, supportive care alone, and more recently, are offered enrollment in clinical trials.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by epithelial cell injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and eventual loss of function. Because mesenchymal stem cells are known to home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a known immune modulator with significant immunosuppressive effects. MSCs have emerged as a promising frontier in human clinical trials. MSCs have been shown to be non-immunogenic making them capable of transplantation across allogeneic barrier. These qualities make MSCs an ideal candidate to study if they are involved in reducing the rejection of the graft, in this case, liver transplant. If so, the information would be highly significant as it would lead to significant reduction in use of immunosuppressants with the replacement of MSCs. This will serve dual purposes: reduced clinical problems associated with pharmacological immunosuppression (discussed in the next paragraph); additional help in the protection of the transplanted liver by the MSCs.\n\nThe use of immunosuppressants in particular is vital in organ transplantation including liver transplant patients. However, their use is accompanied by numerous drawbacks such as reactivation of viral hepatitis, opportunistic infections and other complications. If MSCs can be used to decrease the use of immunosuppressive agents in liver transplant patients it can lead to a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality as a consequence of liver transplantation.\n\nHepatic macrophages, ie Kupffer cells, have a known function of recruiting monocytes into the liver. They have been shown to have a proinflammatory effect by attracting monocytes into the liver. They also interact with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which have pro-fibrogenic functions. However, they have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects as well, implicating a role in fibrosis regression. Hepatic macrophages are an interesting new target for therapeutic intervention and the effect of steroids on kupffer cells as well as their interaction with MSCs have not been fully explored.\n\nPatient will be attached to standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors including pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring temperature and capnometry. Patients will be placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation. As is customary for all liver surgeries, an arterial line will be inserted for blood pressure monitoring and for repeat blood samples. If indicated, a pulmonary artery catheter will be inserted.\n\nAnesthesia will be maintained using a volatile agent. Paralysis will be provided using a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent of the anesthesiologist's choice.\n\nAs is standard practice hourly blood samples will be taken from the arterial line to analyze Protime(PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR)/Complete Blood Count/electrolytes. Red Blood Cells, Fresh Frozen Plasma and platelets will be transfused as necessary.\n\nAs is customary liver transplant recipients will be given the customary dose of methylprednisolone for immune suppression in the anhepatic phase.\n\nIntraoperatively, patients undergoing transplant will have three blood samples collected from the arterial line for study purposes. Each sample will contain 3cc of blood.\n\nThe time points for blood samples are as follows:\n\nImmediately after arterial line placement as a baseline\nIn the anhepatic stage prior to steroid injection\nTwo hours after administration of steroids Post-operatively, two additional 3 mL blood samples will be taken by a member of the study team. The first will be on postoperative day 1 prior to the administration of immunosuppressive drugs and the second sample on postoperative day five. Thus for liver transplant patients a total of 15 milliliters (mL) of blood over a period of 5 days will be collected for the study.\n\nThe administration of immunosuppression drugs and or dosage will not be altered as a component of the research study.\n\nA tissue sample of the liver donor organ will also be taken to culture MCSs (exempt informed consent).\n\nControl group patients will undergo liver resection. They will not receive the dose of methylprednisolone. Intra-operatively blood samples will be collected at these time points:\n\nimmediately after arterial line placement\ntwo hours after liver resection. Postoperatively two additional 3-mL blood samples will be taken. The first will be taken on postoperative day one and the second on postoperative day five or on the day of discharge whichever comes sooner. These samples will be collected by a study team member. A total of 12mL of blood over a period of 5 days will be collected from the liver resection patients for study purposes.\n\nAll blood samples will be immediately delivered to Dr. Rameswhar's lab, located in MSB, E579. The relative frequency of MSCs present in the blood of the two groups will be assessed by flow cytometry. The data will be presented as the percentage of MSCs/106 mononuclear cells. Statistical analyses will be performed to determine if there are differences between the two groups of subjects.\n\nIn addition to the above studies with the donor liver, we will also treat liver cells with glucocorticoids and then examine the liver for changes in aquaporin. The reason for this modification is to determine if aquaporin increases the ability to accumulate water. This additional study will not change the samples since only a small (<1mg) of tissue will be sufficient."

                              "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in the COVID 19 infection pandemic. It is a devastating clinical condition, caused by an acute and diffuse lung injury that requires management in the intensive care unit. It is caused by uncontrolled inflammation that leads to severe pulmonary alveolar damage and capillary membrane leakage, and progressive respiratory failure. There is no effective treatment for ARDS and the only supportive care strategies are the mainstay of therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have high regenerative and immunomodulatory capacities. In preclinical research, ARDS, MSCs modulate the inflammatory response, augment tissue repair, enhance pathogen clearance, and reduce the severity of the injury, pulmonary dysfunction, and apoptosis. Moreover, many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus (e.g., Influenza)-induced lung injury and mortality in animals. Since 2014 clinical trials are using MSC from variable sources [bone marrow (BM), fat, and umbilical cord (UC)] in the treatment of ARDS. Some of the clinical trials are ongoing and the final reports are not reported. In all final reports, the safety of the application of MSC has been documented and most of them implied improvement in mortality and decrease of morbidity. Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated that MSCs or their extracellular vesicles (MSCs-EVs) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. Also, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and the outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-EVs have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nCritically ill coronavirus documented cases suspicious to ARDS (mild or moderate) will be enrolled in the study. Our previous experiment (IRCT20200217046526N1) showed the safety of 3 injections of MSCs in patients with COVID-19. This multi-center trial will recruit 60 patients.

                              "Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event, especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over 10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute respiratory impairment.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nAlthough human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use.\n\nThe purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."

In the United States there are 5 million people living with CHF, and each year 60.000 people reach terminal phases of the disease, with mortality rates of 70-80% at two years. Although the first cause of CHF in developed countries is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents almost half of the cases of newly diagnosed CHF. Treatment of CHF includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, including implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy and heart transplantation. Despite all these advances, CHF prognosis remains poor. Cardiac stem cell therapy emerged more than ten years ago as a new hope for CHF patients.\n\nAlthough the most extensive evidence of the benefits of stem cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases refers to ischemic heart disease (CAD), initial experiences with stem cells for other conditions such as DCM are encouraging.\n\nThis randomized clinical trial will include 70 patients with DCM, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 20% and 45%, and who are symptomatic in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III/IV. In a first-in-man pilot phase, 10 patients will be treated with transendocardial injections of bone marrow-derived MSCs after cardiac catheterization and NOGA XPTM mapping of the left ventricle. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will analyse the safety and feasibility of this first phase of the trial, and then 60 patients more will be randomized to receive MSCs or placebo (ratio 3:1).\n\nPrimary objectives include safety and feasibility variables, and secondary objectives include efficacy variables. All patients will be studied with a complete cardiac imaging protocol that includes: electrocardiography, echocardiography, treadmill tests with oxygen consumption, holter, laboratory analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), electromechanical mapping (NOGA XPTM) and quality of life questionnaires."

                              "Since its introduction into clinical trials, cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloro-platinum) has had a major impact in cancer medicine, changing the course of therapeutic management of several tumors, such as those of ovary, testes, and the head and neck. Unfortunately, in addition to causing bone marrow suppression, ototoxicity, and anaphylaxis, dose-dependent and cumulative nephrotoxicity is the major toxicity of this compound, sometimes requiring a reduction in dose or discontinuation of treatment. Approximately 25-35% of patients develop evidence of nephrotoxicity following an initial dose (50-100 mg/m2) of cisplatin, due to its preferential accumulation within the proximal tubular cells in the outer medulla of the kidney. Tubular cell events activated by cisplatin toxicity translate into the fact that cisplatin predictably lowers glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a clear dose-dependent manner even after a single drug exposure. Early proteinuria is mild, as it is glycosuria. Overall these findings indicate that there is a pressing need for way to protect the kidney while administering effective chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin.\n\nPresent strategies for the treatment of acute renal failure have focused on targeting individual mechanisms thought to contribute to ischemic or toxic insults to the kidney.An alternative possibility is to adopt a novel strategy that would allow regeneration of the injured renal tissue. Renal recovery following acute tubular injury, like that induced by cisplatin treatment, is often a slow process requiring many days to weeks to occur. Attempts to accelerate recovery have focused on the administration of growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1. While growth factor therapy has been successful in experimental models, no beneficial effects have been observed in limited clinical trials. The ability of extrarenal cells to participate in the regenerative response following post-transplant acute renal failure may hold true for acute renal failure that develops in native kidneys after cisplatin therapy. The rationale for this approach rests on the recent demonstration in mice and in athymic nude rats that stem cells from bone marrow can be used to grow new muscle or blood vessels in heart tissue that has been damaged after myocardial infarction. Similarly, consistent evidence of the beneficial effect of bone-marrow derived cell therapy has been recently reported in humans with ischemic heart disease. This approach has been also successfully extended to repair ischemically and cisplatin injured renal tubules in mice. The observation raises the possibility that adult-derived bone marrow cells could be administered to enhance the recovery from renal injury. Although no human data so far are available, we expect that ex-vivo expanded donor bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) infusion would allow to accelerate tubular regeneration and thus renal function recovery in patients with cisplatin-induced acute renal failure, a disease that, like ischemically-induced acute renal injury, so far has no cure.\n\nUp to now there is no clinical study of repair tissue injury in patients with acute renal failure due to ischemic or toxic insults. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the effectiveness of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions like as inborn errors of metabolism,osteogenesis imperfecta,allogeneic HSC transplantation, treatment of acute GVHD, acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe aim of this pilot, explorative, study is to test the feasibility and safety of systemic infusion of donor ex-vivo expanded MSC to repair the kidney and improve function in patients with solid organ cancers who develop acute renal failure after chemotherapy with cisplatin."

                              "MES-HT is a phase 1-2 multicenter pilot prospective study conducted on 14 heart transplant patients who developed severe coronary vasculopathy, in the aim to assess the effect on myocardial perfusion of the intramyocardial administration by percutaneous way of autologous mesenchymal stem cells derived from the bone marrow.\n\nThe main objective is to show improvement in myocardial perfusion in a non-randomized and uncontrolled pilot study, before considering a randomized controlled study. The administration of intra myocardial cells using the NOGA system was carried out to date with more than 1,000 patients and is considered feasible and safe. However, the investigators will assess very carefully the feasibility and safety of this invasive approach.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the improvement of myocardial perfusion measured by MRI after endomyocardial injection of mesenchymal cells by percutaneous way, guided by the NOGA system.\n\nThe secondary endpoints are the feasibility and safety of this administration, changes in ejection fraction measured by contrast echocardiography, changes in other MRI cardiac parameters (left ventricular volumes , intramyocardial fibrosis), the oxygen consumption during exercise, myocardial perfusion measured by SPECT. Other secondary endpoints are the evolution of the immune status, and histological criteria of myocardial biopsy.\n\nOnce the mapping performed, preparation is injected through another catheter (MYOSTAR injection catheter) which will also be guided by the Noga\u00ae system. This catheter may be positioned on the regions of interest (viable ischemic areas) and allow the injection of the quantity of CSM (40 million / ml) in 10 to 12 different injection points and injection volumes 0.3 ml for a total dose of 120 to 144 million cells.\n\nAfter each injection procedure, patients are monitored for 48 hours minimum clinically and under continuous ECG monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. A troponin dosage is done after 6 H, and after 24 and 48 hours. An echocardiogram is performed immediately after the procedure and before the release to 48 H.\n\nA clinical evaluation will be made after the patient is discharged at 1 month (clinical examination + Holter + echocardiography), 3 months (examination), 6 months (clinical examination, Holter, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, test of effort with measurement of VO2, effort myocardial tomoscintigraphy and for patients from Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, Rubidium 82 by positron emission tomography) and 12 months (examination). Myocardial biopsy and a control coronary angiography will be only performed within 12 months in accordance with the practice of the teams.\n\nPatients will benefit from a biological monitoring which provides for the monitoring of immune response. This immuno-monitoring is to assess the possible influence of the injection of mesenchymal cells on immunological tolerance mechanisms. It will be implemented in the balance sheets of cardiac tissue at the waning annual biopsies and peripheral blood samples on inclusion, 48 hours after injection and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe limiting toxicity is defined as the occurrence at one month of a serious adverse effect related to the protocol , requiring an hospitalization or being able to be life-threatening , or like abundant pericardial effusion requiring pericardial drainage, bleeding complications requiring blood cell transfusion or surgery, stroke constituted, sepsis or septic shock, cardiogenic shock, severe ventricular rhythm refractory death.\n\nAll patients are followed for one year."

Induction therapy with antibody plus the maintenance immunosuppressive agents have greatly improved graft survival in renal transplantation. Since mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s), we evaluate autologous MSCs as an alternative for antibody induction therapy. Moreover, we examine if MSCs could improve the recovery of early function in transplanted kidney."

Surgery of corneal transplantation\uff0camniotic membrane transplantation are some of effective,however,these therapy are expensive and the transplantation resources are limited. To arrest the inflammatory phase, several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been investigated. Corticosteroids also is important, however, long time usage of corticosteroids often cause severe side-effects. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the biological characteristics of self -renewal, immune regulation, multidirectional differentiation and tissue repair. Our preliminary research showed that in corneal alkali injury rats, the MSC can accelerated the cornea repair, inhibited angiogenesis. Many animal research also revealed that MSC have effect on the ocular alkali burned. And subconjunctivity injection is efficient, the clinical study of MSC on treating other disease have been developed rapidly recently, in further ,the outcome are encouraging, and no side-effect related MSC was reported, MSC can come from bone marrow, Umbilical cord blood\uff0cAdipose tissue and so on, but bone marrow MSC is mostly common used. The investigators propose to assess the efficacy and safety of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in the treatment of corneal burn in human."

At present, the standard first-line treatment of cGVHD is still hormone or combined with immunosuppressant of cyclosporine. The dry eyes related to cGVHD are treated with artificial tears, lacrimal punctum embolization, local immunosuppressant or even blepharoplasty to reduce dry eye symptoms. Although a variety of new immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies have been used in clinic, the overall efficacy is still unsatisfactory with apparent side effects, and the period of treatment is long with high-costs. Therefore, it is an urgent task for clinicians to explore new methods of cGVHD related dry eye therapy and improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients.\n\nExosomes are a kind of membrane vesicles secreted by parental cells, which can mediate the transfer of RNA, protein, DNA and other functional molecules between cells and regulate the function of target cells. The therapeutic potential of UMSC exosomes has been widely studied in diseases of liver, kidney, skin and so on. Previously, we found that UMSC exosomes can significantly alleviate the symptoms of dry eye in the dry eye animal model. At present, we plan to clarify its efficacy in clinical research.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to assess the alleviation of dry eye symptoms in patients with cGVHD after UMSC-exo treatment by measuring Ocular Surface Index Score (OSDI), and the second objective include the measurement of tear secretion amount, tear break time, the areas stained by fluorescent, ocular redness, tear meniscus and best corrected visual acuity.\n\nApproximately 27 study subjects will be recruited. The treatment group will receive artificial tears for 2 weeks to normalize the baseline, followed by intervention of UMSC-exo 10ug/drop, four times a day for 14 days. The follow-up visit will be 12-week, progression of dry eye will be measured."

Patients with severe aplastic anemia produce too few blood cells, causing fatigue, easy bruising and bleeding, and susceptibility to infections. In many cases, the very low blood counts result from an autoimmune process. The patient's own immune system damages their stem cells in bone marrow.\n\nAlthough immune-suppressing drugs, such as corticosteroids, CsA and ATG, have been used in the treatment of SAA, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response rate to these drugs is less than 60%. Addition, the severe side effects of these immune-suppressing drugs have also been observed. The management of SAA patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed.

                              "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Ukraine. This will be a Phase I study with the main emphasis on the safety and efficiency profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."

In the initial phase of the trial (n=5), patients were sequentially recruited, with a safety period of 15 days, receiving unblinded cell therapy. In the second phase of the trial, subjects are block randomised (1:1) to receive either MSCs (n=5), or placebo (n=5), as the control treatment. Immune response variables, adverse events, opportunistic infection signs are evaluated as determinants of safety and efficacy of MSCs. Study endpoints are measured along a follow-up period of 24 months, that includes 17 visits according to a decreasing frequency rate.

Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nAs current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine in the treatment of psoriasis.\n\nThis study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nTherefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to participate in this study will be interviewed."

MDS is characterized by variable degrees of cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia ) and risk of transformation to leukemia.\n\nTo date treatment of MDS is unsatisfactory: chemotherapy has a limited role in the management of leukemic progression; autologous stem cell transplantation does not prolong relapse-free survival and stem cell transplantation is poorly tolerated in older individuals. Some MDS patients have been shown to respond to a wide variety of immunosuppressive agents ranging from corticosteroids to CsA and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). However, the overall response rate is less than 30%. In fact, few treatments appear to change the natural history of MDS.\n\nThe management of MDS patients therefore remains to be improved. Human MSCs isolated from Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord/placenta have been shown to have immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC transplant in the MDS patients.\n\nThis study will last about 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MSC transplant (Group 1) or CsA therapy alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study (defined as Day 0). After 3 months, patients will receive the second MSC transplantation when one responds well to the treatment. After 3, 6 and 12 months from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated."

                              "Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are common debilitating complications after surgical repaired for ATAAD. MODS is one of the chief causes of post-operative death for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients, and it was reported that MODS accounted for more than half of the death after surgery for ATAAD. Despite recent advance in surgical technique, mortality rate remains high in such critical care conditions. In animal models, studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of MSCs with respect to ischemia-reperfusion injury of heart, lungs, kidney, brains and livers. Several pilot studies have provided evidence that MSC may be effective in treating critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, acute renal failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is increasing evidence that MSCs function in a paracrine manner. Exosomes have been reported to activate signaling pathways by binding to receptors. Compared with mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes are more stable and storable and no risk of aneuploidy. The possibility of immune rejection after allogeneic administration of exosomes is lower and can provide alternative treatment for a variety of diseases.\n\nThe trial contains two parts:\n\nPart one (prevention scheme):to explore the safety and efficacy of exosome of MSC, the investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with ATAAD, and 15 participants will be administrated intravenously with exosome of MSC immediately after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple branched stent graft while other 15 not. Then the investigators will monitor participants' MODS related biochemical indexes, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, comparing to those don't be treated with exosome of MSC.\n\nPhase two (treatment scheme): for patients presenting severe MODS (SOFA score\u226510) after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft, the investigators will randomly use exosome of MSC to 15 of participants while other 15 not. Then the investigators will monitor participants' MODS related biochemical indexes, SOFA scores, comparing to those don't be treated with MSC. The dosage of the exosome of MSC was determined on the basis of the previous clinical studies, which is 180mg once a time and administrated intravenously."

Each ATCell\u2122 cell line will be created from cells grown from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of a participant's own adipose tissue collected by liposuction, and each treated participant will only receive their own cells.\n\nWithin the treated group, 3 dosing levels will be explored: 50 million cells, 150 million cells, or 300 million cells, and a Placebo group which will receive 5% dextrose lactated Ringer's solution free of cells. Participant follow-ups will take place 1 day following the tissue harvest procedure and, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following ATCell\u2122 treatment. Comprehensive participant's evaluations involving data collection will take place 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment.\n\nIt has been proposed that in general, mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) events need to be taken far more seriously, and that even mild TBI events can result in lasting negative consequences as evidenced by lower performances on neuropsychological assessments when compared with age-matched controls2. In fact, this condition may eventually lead to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which, together may be termed the AD-like dementias3, further underscoring the need for effective clinical intervention. Currently, no effective treatments are available for this condition aside from treatment of the symptoms, although some more comprehensive treatments have been proposed."

Several studies have shown that the immune system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and umbilical-cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via its immunomodulatory properties have the potential to improve insulin resistance condition and pancreatic beta-cells dysfunction thus improve the glycemic control and insulin requirement in T2D patients. In this pilot study, we plan to recruit 15 T2D patients with total daily dose of insulin >= 0.5 unit/kgBW/day to receive BM-MNCs (5 subjects) or UC-MSCs injections (10 subjects).

                              "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a type of inflammation of the skin. It results in itchy, swollen, red, and cracked skin. The symptoms typically start in childhood with changing severity over the years. The pathogenesis of AD is characterized by excessive type 2 helper T cell mediated inflammatory responses, resulting in B lymphocyte mediated increase in serum level of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Subsequent degranulation of mast cells by IgE releases various inflammatory mediators, which recruit the lymphocytes and eosinophils into the lesion.\n\nCurrent clinical management of AD includes topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants. However, these drugs have been reported to carry the risk of side-effects and severe.\n\nSeveral recent studies including ours have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could suppress allergic responses in AD. MSCs have been known to interact with cell types of both innate and adaptive immune systems, which results in the suppressive effect on proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune cells including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Indeed, a number of studies have reported that the immunomodulatory ability of MSCs can be usefully applied for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammation-related diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis. Therefore, MSCs has possibility as a new drug for AD."

                              "Aims and Hypothesis\n\nBased in previously reported studies and following a translational approach, a hypothesis that the paracrine effect linked to cultured autogenous growth factors and cytokines at physiologic concentrations acting locally in grafted sites might promote a faster and/or more efficient cell response and consequently induce a more significant/faster bone formation was considered. The presence of these molecules added to synthetic bone substitutes might act positively in terms of local cell recruitment (chemotaxis), proliferation, differentiation and bone protein synthesis. Also, recurrent biological hazards involved in conventional tissue-engineered cellular graft compounds, usually linked to the ex vivo manipulation of cells in terms of tumorigenicity, immunogenicity and the previously reported cell dedifferentiation phenomenon would be mitigated by the exclusion of the cell element of this process, as they are considered by some reports to present unpredictable mitotic behavior once artificially cultured. The present study aims to further extend this translational investigation following preclinical studies by the principal investigator, proposing a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial on the possible benefits associated with the application of a tissue-engineered bone graft compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-cultured medium (CM) and an hydroxylapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate-based synthetic bone substitute (HP/\u03b2-TCP ceramic). Specific aims include analyses on the density of the newly formed calcified tissue by computed tomography (CBCTs), expression of specific immunohistochemical bone formation markers (RT-PCR) and histomorphometric bone quantity evaluation. In a split-mouth study model, the resultant bone formation after HP/\u03b2-TCP grafting with and without CM will be analyzed, compared and quantified at different time points.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n2.1- Study design\n\nA prospective split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was chosen as study design for the present investigation. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics Committee and registration at the clinical trials.gov platform, following CONSORT guidelines, 20 consecutive patients who seek maxillary oral rehabilitation at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry of the School of Health and Life Sciences - PUCRS, Brazil, will be invited to participate in the present investigation.\n\n2.2 - Lipoplasty and human adipose stem cells (hASCs) harvesting/culture.\n\nFor hASCs harvesting, an abdominal lipoplasty procedure will be proposed and performed following a signed informed consent. Under intravenous sedation and supplementary oxygen release with an oral catheter, along with local anesthesia, a standard surgical lipoplasty technique will be performed. As previously described, from this liposuction material, 25 to 30 ml of fat will be transferred into a 50 ml Falcon tube. The fat will be then washed by centrifugation (430\u00c5~g 10 min), being the upper fat layer transferred into a new Falcon tube, where an equal volume of collagenase solution will be added to the mixture and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a water bath. After centrifugation, the upper fat layer will be discarded and the supernatant removed. The remaining cell pellet containing the hASCs will be resuspended with 15 ml of culture medium. After adding 15 ml of warm culture medium, the cell suspension will be transferred into a T175 culture flask. The hASCs will be incubated in a humidified environment at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the cell pellet will be resuspended in warm culture medium and seeded into new cell culture flasks.\n\n2.3 - Concentrated culture medium (CM) preparation and analysis\n\nStem cell culture and CM preparation will be performed at a GMP certified facility for regenerative medicine products. At first, the surface antigen profiles of isolated hASCs at third passage will be characterized by flow cytometry. The presence of CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD44 markers and the absence of CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19 and HLA-DR will be assessed to confirm the desired cell phenotype as recommended by protocols of the International Society of Cellular Therapy.[ Then, a sample of these cells will be also characterized by staining (Alizarin Red S) in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell expansion and CM will be generated following standard stem cell culture protocols. Before clinical use, CM will be examined not only for contamination with bacteria, fungi, or mycoplasmas but also for infection with viruses including hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency and human T-cell leukemia viruses. Then, CM will be properly cool-stored and sent to clinical application (up to 6 hours), to avoid long-term denaturation/inactivation of present signalling molecules, as previously suggested.\n\n2.4 - Maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure\n\nUnder IV sedation and supplementary oxygen release with an oral catheter, along with local anesthesia, the maxillary bone will be grafted internally by drilling an access in the lateral maxillary sinus wall. Sinus membrane dissection with careful release and elevation will be also performed. Preoperative randomizing by computer-generated random numbers will be used to determine test and control sinuses for each patient. The bony floor of the maxillary sinus on the test site will be augmented with 4 to 5g of a synthetic bone substitute (BoneCeramic\u2122 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM. The control site will receive similar amount of bone substitute embedded in 10 to 15 ml of saline solution. Patients will be released from hospital facility 2h after surgery. They will be instructed in postoperative hygiene and eating behavior. All patients will receive postoperative antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapies.\n\n2.5 - Implant placement and bone biopsies harvesting\n\nAfter 6 months of healing, implant placement will follow routine surgical protocols as recommended by the implant manufacturer. Under local anesthesia, a mid-crestal linear incision and full-thickness flap will be performed with releasing incisions whenever necessary. Then, with a 16:1 contra-angle attached to a surgical unit and a trephine bur (\u00d8 3mm), the grafted area correspondent to the 2nd premolar, 1st and 2nd molar regions will be biopsied at both right and left sides of the maxilla (n=06 sites per patient), guided by a previously made acrylic resin surgical stent. Bone biopsies will be then divided in two segments, where one will be stored in 4% formaldehyde solution for histologic analysis and the other in Eppendorf vials with RNALater for RT-PCR analysis. Then, the sequence of implant surgical burs as recommended by the manufacturer will be followed for the placement of 6 to 8 implants per patient. Registration of primary stability at insertion will be done by both manual torque wrench and classified into three groups. A healing abutment will be then placed, and wound closure will be conducted with non-resorbable suture material A 6-month one-stage healing protocol will be adopted for all implants.\n\n2.6 - CBCT image analysis\n\nHigh-resolution CBCT images will be obtained at three different time-points as part of the treatment protocol, meaning at pre-operative bone graft [baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2] days (implant placement pre-operative), aiming both pre-op surgical planning and post-op evaluation of the bone formation. The morphometric bone parameters will be calculated in 3D analysis according to the recommendations of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) as previously proposed, and statistical analysis will be used to identify the best parameter combinations aiming to differentiate trabecular bone into three bone categories: (i) sparse-related to a loose bone structure, (ii) intermediate-related to a well-structured trabecular bone, and (iii) dense bone types-related to a massive bone area with little space between the trabeculae.\n\n2.7 - Histologic and histomorphometric analyses\n\nFollowing removal of graft biopsies at implant placement, bone blocks containing the control and test bone sites will be shaped and decalcified with 5% HNO3. The blocks will dehydrate in a graded alcohol series, clarify with xylene and be embedded in resin. Then, the resin will be polymerised in a UV light chamber for 10h. Using a diamond micro saw, a total of three 3-\u03bcm-thick slices from each block will be ground transversely to each specimen long axis at 50, 100, and 150\u03bcm from their external portion. After this, routine staining with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Azur II and Pararosaniline will be done aiming to differentiate between HP/\u03b2-TCP particles and newly formed bone. Microscopic analysis will be performed at 24X magnification using an optical stereo microscope connected to a digital camera. Image analysis will be performed using the ImageJ\u00ae software.\n\n2.8 - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\n\nFollowing the preparation of the collected graft biopsies for RNA extraction, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis will be applied to quantify alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth factor, Osteonectin, Osteopontin and type 1 collagen."

A block size of 4 will be considered. Two groups of equal proportion will be formed, where only one will receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs besides the conventional therapy provided to both groups. Those who assess the study outcomes will remain unaware of the allocation (single-blind).\n\nThis study will use cGMP-certified clinical-grade human WJ-MSCs (Cell Tech Pharmed Co. Ltd., Tehran, Iran).In the intervention group, all 120 patients will receive a single intracoronary infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs alongside the conventional treatment that will be provided to the same number of patients in the control group. Patients in the intervention group will be taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where the infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs will be done through the intracoronary route.\n\nBefore statistical analysis, adjudication of all measurements will be done by an experienced cardiology department member excluded from the research group. The adjudicator will assess the quality of each measurement and will exclude those with inadequate quality from the analysis, where they will be regarded as missing. An independent, blinded safety committee will evaluate potential major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Once the adjudication process is complete, the finalized database will be unblinded.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group. Treatment efficacy will be assessed according to the decrement in HF with the help of Cox regression analysis. The investigators will consider the EF to have improved significantly if a minimum increment of 3% is achieved after six months. The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat approach. The baseline characteristics of the two study groups will also be compared. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation, while frequencies and percentages will be given for categorical data. The EF, as the primary outcome, will be compared between the study groups using the independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The therapeutic effect will be estimated with a 95% CI. Two-sided P-values will be used. Safety will be compared between the two groups according to the occurrence of MACEs (death, recurrent AMI, ICD insertion, non-target vessel revascularization, etc.) and serious adverse events (SAEs). These events will be followed over time with Kaplan-Meier curves, which will allow us to understand their patterns. With the help of the Cox proportional hazards model, The investigators will assess the statistical significance and 95% CI.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group.

The DSMB will have the authority to stop the trial early if patient safety is compromised or if the primary research objective is met. All safety issues (unanticipated SAEs, mortality, intracoronary infusion complications, and severe arrhythmias, etc.) will be monitored by the DSMB, and the DSMB statistician will report the occurrence of safety issues in each study group quarterly. All deaths will be reported.\n\nThe investigators have discussed all ethical issues with the Institutional Review Board of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, which ultimately approved the study protocol (IR.SUMS.REC.1400.409). Informed consent will be obtained once patients are clinically stable and sedatives or strong analgesics do not alter their consciousness. Importantly, the use of low balloon inflation pressure and divided (three-part) infusions will prevent complications related to intracoronary cell infusion. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki will be upheld throughout this study."

Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection.

                              "Treatment of nonunion, delayed union and malunion fractures of long bones remains problematic. The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third and sixth month after the fracture. Nonunion is a serious complication of a fracture, occurring in 2-10% of patients, as it is associated with high economic and health burden. Many cases are subsequently approached by multiple surgical and nonsurgical modalities. Various devices, under the name of \"bone growth stimulators\" have been used to enhance healing of the fracture. Recent studies, demonstrated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in regeneration of bone and cartilage tissue. In this study percutaneous injection of mesenchymal stem cells to the site of fracture is performed as an outpatient procedure or during an operative exposure to evaluate its efficacy in enhancing bone regeneration. In the case of small size of bone gap, mesenchymal stem cells are injected into the callus of fracture site through an outpatient procedure under the guide of fluoroscopy. If there is a large bone gap, through a surgical management, mesenchymal stem cells seeded on bone matrix are placed at the site of fracture. Patients are followed by X-Ray examination 1,2,6, and 12 months after treatment."

                              "Since December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\nHuman and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the \"New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)\", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases. Early research in this laboratory used UC-MSCs to intervene in endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice, and confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect mouse lung tissue from endotoxin-induced damage.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This trial will recruit 48 patients. 24 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (4 times) of 5.0*10E6 cells/kg of UC-MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 24 patients received conventional treatment were used as control group. The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days to 96 weeks follow up."

                              "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders, affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to the respiratory failure. Numerous studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the clinical and pathological features of ALS patients. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine) effect of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to enrollment. Patients are recruited for a clinical trial no more than 1 year from the disease diagnosis. Then, patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one application of WJ-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications (each administration every two months) of WJ-MSCs. Subsequently, allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period."

The widely used treatments include topical agents, systemic medications and biologic agents, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Besides, non-standardized treatment or the disease itself may lead transformation to other diseases, which add more importance to finding improved management strategies.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and fat cells. They have several functions, such as migration to skin lesions, immunomodulation, limitation of autoimmunity and local paracrine effects. It reported MSCs have already been used in some kinds of autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis et al.\n\nIn this study, consenting umbilical cords are donated by healthy donors. After several processing steps, UC-MSCs are separated and froze for future infusions. When volunteers are recruited, their condition will be assessed by Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Then MSCs will be infused according to a standard scheme. After all 6 infusions, the patient will be re-assessed by the PASI and DLQI and will be followed up for one year."

                              "Historically, treatment of MMC was limited to post-natal surgery to close the dura and skin over the spinal cord to prevent meningitis, which had no effect on motor function. The potential benefit of earlier intervention was realized when prenatal ultrasound of patients with MMC early in gestation revealed near-normal leg movements despite displaying paralysis at birth. This finding gave credence to the two-hit hypothesis that paralysis was progressive during prenatal life and suggested that fetal intervention could prevent the secondary damage to the spinal cord. Fetal repair of MMC did confer improvement in motor function of children treated in the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) randomized controlled trial. The promising results of the MOMS trial demonstrated the potential for improvement of paralysis for these patients, but distal motor function still remained severely impaired in the majority of patients with MMC with standard in utero repair alone. While this demonstrated that the ideal time to intervene to prevent paralysis is in utero with the goal of preventing the accrual of ongoing damage to the spinal cord, there is still room for improvement. The remarkable regenerative capacity of the fetal environment combined with regenerative capacity of placental mesenchymal stem cells offers potential for augmentation of the fetal repair of MMC with a novel therapy to further reduce and repair the sustained spinal cord damage."

Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. Decompensated liver cirrhosis is mainly manifested by liver function damage and portal hypertension, with multiple system involvement. Complications such as upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, secondary infection, hypersplenism, ascites, and carcinogenesis often occur in the late stage. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and Tregs transplantation had been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

                              "INTRODUCTION:\n\nContour deformities of the face requiring soft tissue augmentation are usually associated with hyper pigmentation of overlying skin. These deformities often result from a variety of conditions like trauma, infection and certain acquired diseases1. Contour deformities of face cause both functional as well as aesthetic problems for the patient. Hyper pigmentation of overlying skin makes these deformities more pronounced and iniquitous. Conventionally, contour problems are treated by using allogenic fillers, major flap surgery and fat grafting2. Flap surgery causes donor site morbidities and does not address pigmentary changes. Allogenic fillers, on the other hand,are expensive and also do not improve hyper pigmentation of overlying skin. Lasers and de-pigmentary creams have been described for addressing pigmentary issue but no satisfactory measure is available so far. Moreover, these modalities do not treat contour deformity.\n\nAutologous fat grafting has gained acceptance to improve skin texture and post inflammatory hyper pigmentation associated with contour deformities of face2,3. Fat, being an autologous tissue, is an ideal choice to rejuvenate hyper pigmented skin owing to its abundant availability in areas like abdomen, buttocks, thighs and arms without any significant donor site morbidity. Repeat sessions of fat injection can be done if needed. Fat grafting is not new and it may be a safe and natural method to improve skin hyper pigmentation. One major problem related to fat grafting is resorption of grafted fat at recipient site ranging from 40% to 80% 4. It requires multiple sessions of fat injection. In literature, many treatment options have been utilized to solve this issue of resorption, one of these is enrichment of fat graft with mesenchymal stem cells 5. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from fatty tissue possess potential to proliferate as well as differentiate into multiple cell lines6,7. These mesenchymal cells not only increase consistency of grafted fat but also lead to rejuvenation of the skin overlying the fat grafted area and improve pigmentary changes of this overlying skin. However, previously published data has failed to establish a clear association of mesenchymal stem cells with improvement in hyper pigmentation of skin overlying fat grafted contour deformities of face. In order to find a reliable mean to decrease hyper pigmentation of skin overlying contour deformities of face, more work is needed to be done.\n\nIn the current study we propose the novel idea of lipo-filling the contour defects of face associated with overlying skin hyper pigmentation using enriched conventional fat graft with ex-vivo expanded fat derived mesenchymal stem cells to potentiate the improvement in overlying skin hyper pigmentation and to enhance reliability of the final outcome of surgery8,9,10,11.\n\nThe rationale of the study is to compare the improvement in skin hyper pigmentation after conventional fat grafting and stem cell enriched fat grafting for contour deformities of face associated with hyper pigmentation of overlying skin. If enrichment of fat graft with fat derived mesenchymal stem cells can increase its effect on improvement in the hyper pigmentation of overlying skin, this innovative strategy can render fat transfer a reliable option for soft tissue augmentation in contour deformities of face with overlying skin hyper pigmentation2. This can definitely improve final clinical outcome by decreasing donor site morbidity.\n\n6.4 OBJECTIVES: To compare the long term effect on skin hyper pigmentation after conventional fat grafting and adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells enriched fat grafting for the treatment of deformities of the face associated with overlying skin hyper pigmentation."

                              "Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized as hypergonadotropic ovarian failure mostly prevalent before age 40. It is astonishingly frequent and affects around 1% of women below the age of 40. The clinical findings include amenorrhea and abnormally high levels of luteinizing (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The etiology of POF is unidentified in the majority of cases. It can occur due to a combination of genetics, immunological diseases, and environmental factors. POF is characterized by lack of secondary follicles, arrested folliculogenesis, decreased estrogen levels, and female infertility.\n\nCurrently, no available therapeutic intervention has been verified effective in retrieving fertility in patients with POF. Several trials at ovarian stimulation are typically ineffective. Consequently, the diagnosis of POF can cause great physical and emotional distress among patients. Hence, there is serious need to develop innovative treatment plans for POF.\n\nThe latest research shows that reduced ovarian reserve is caused by aging of the niche rather than a defect in germ cell lines. Current scientific evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could repair injured tissues and holds great promise in treating many diseases including male and female infertility.\n\nThe uniqueness of this study is demonstrated in the transplantation of purified specific populations of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into patients with POF without in vitro expansion or culture, with minimal manipulation. Stem cells are withdrawn and transplanted back into the patient on the same day of the procedure, thus presenting the highest safety and efficacy parameters."

                              "This is a pilot study evaluating the addition of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) infusions to corticosteroids for the early treatment of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is a major complication following allogeneic stem cell transplant. GVHD occurs when T-lymphocytes in the donor graft respond to signals from recipient cells and cause tissue damage. This process can lead to organ injury, increased risk of infection, and graft failure. Corticosteroids have been used as the primary therapy for acute GVHD for decades, and guidelines currently recommend their use as front line treatment. Recent prospective data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network shows that GVHD will be cured in about half of patients with steroids alone. Patients who do not respond to steroids are considered steroid-resistant, and this is associated with much worse survival. It is possible to predict which patients will go on to have steroid-resistant GVHD by measuring the plasma concentration of the molecule called suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2). BMSC infusions have been used to treat steroid-resistant acute GVHD successfully, but despite a track record of safety, little is known about the use of BMSC in the early treatment setting. The main objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of administering BMSC within 5 days of diagnosis of acute GVHD. Our study will for the first time use the ST2 biomarker to more accurately assign acute GVHD to steroid refractory or sensitive, and explore changes in ST2 and other biological markers of BMSC function and their correlation with clinical response. In the process of this study, we will assess the safety and feasibility of early treatment according to our regimen, obtain estimates of efficacy at important GVHD therapy time points, and determine if treatment with BMSC can prevent the progression of GVHD in patients with high risk of GVHD progression as measured by biomarkers.\n\nThe Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center NIH has developed a BMSC repository at NIH. The NIH BMSC are a third party, early passage product based on the EU manufacturing approach. The NIH BMSC cellular product was administered safely to transplant recipients with steroid-resistant acute GVHD in a phase I study (protocol 12-H-0010, IND #14596) conducted from March 2012 to October 2012 at NIH. This pilot study is a continuation of the previous study and open to allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients at NIH (age greater than or equal to 4 yrs) with de novo acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy either directly after allogeneic transplantation or following treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion. Subjects will receive BMSC infusions (target dose of 2 times 10(6) BMSC/kg for up to 12 doses) in addition to standard upfront therapy with corticosteroids. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients without a treatment-related severe adverse event (TRSAE) at day +56. Responses will be assessed at day +28 and +56 from the initial diagnosis. Responses will be correlated to changes in GVHD biomarkers including ST2, Reg3a, TNFR1, and IL-6. Subjects will be enrolled at first diagnosis of acute GVHD, and the first BMSC infusion will be given within 120 hours of the first dose of corticosteroids. BMSC infusions will be given twice weekly for the first 4 weeks. Subjects with a complete response at the end of week 4 will not receive further infusions. All other subjects will receive BMSC infusions weekly for four additional weeks. Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Research samples will be drawn at regular intervals to explore biological correlates of response and to investigate the mechanism of action of BMSC."

Acute GVHD is defined using the NIH consensus definition inclusive of classic acute (less than or equal to 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features) AND persistent/recurrent/late onset acute (> 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features). Subjects with stage I and II skin only (overall Grade I) or isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement are eligible if the treating physician deems that systemic corticosteroid treatment is indicated. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is desirable, but not required for study entry because enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results. Patients must be diagnosed with a first episode of acute GVHD requiring systemic corticosteroids and associated with preceding administration of a cellular therapy including stem cells and donor lymphocyte infusion. Patients who were treated for GVHD associated with another cellular therapy product (e.g. prior allogeneic transplant or DLI) will be allowed into the study.\n\nPrevious immunosuppressive therapy\n\nThe patient must have received no systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of new acute GVHD (e.g. pentostatin, etanercept, denileukin difitox, etc.), except for a maximum 120 hours prior corticosteroid therapy. This does not include immune suppressive therapy for GVHD prophylaxis (e.g. calcineurin inhibitor, sirolimus, MMF, etc.). It is expected that most patients will be receiving GVHD prophylaxis as part of their transplant regimen, thus patients developing acute GVHD while on GVHD prophylaxis will still be considered eligible. Concurrent or addition of locally-acting steroid therapy (skin creams, oral budesonide, or any other locally-acting steroid preparation) is allowed.\nThere is one exception to the above stipulations: Use of the oral medication MMF (in addition to systemic corticosteroids) for the treatment of acute GVHD will be allowed. MMF is commonly given early in the treatment of acute GVHD, but it has not been shown to improve outcomes compared to steroids alone in a randomized, prospective study; therefore, treatment with MMF will not exclude patients from BMSC treatment.\nAge: Age greater than or equal to 4 years old will be allowed.\nBirth control: Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are being treated on this study.\nInformed consent: Signed informed consent and/or assent is required. Assent and educational materials will be provided to, and reviewed with, patients under the age of 18. The informed consent process will begin at recognition of patient eligibility.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nBreast feeding or pregnant females (due to unknown risk to fetus or newborn).\nKnown allergy to gentamicin."

Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis, However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation, donor shortage, long waiting list, high cost, risk of rejection, operative complications and complications related to immunosuppressive drugs.\n\n\"stem cells\" are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types and can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. In recent years, advances in stem cell biology, have made the prospect of tissue regeneration a potential clinical reality, and several studies have shown the great promise that stem cells hold for therapy. mesenchymal stem cell based therapy has shown as promising tool in cirrhotic conditions as this type of cells have the ability to differentiate to different cell types including hepatocytes A series of studies have been performed to assess the application of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to promote liver regeneration and to alleviate cirrhosis. Some animal-based studies showed that stem cell transplantation could ameliorate liver fibrosis and improve liver functions followed by several clinical trials on human, in patients with advanced liver diseases, these studies demonstrated that stem cell transplantation could significantly reverse hepatic failure with only limited side effects.

Therapy results on humanized mice will be correlated with existing or newly acquired efficacy results from those same immune-based or other therapies in patients. A secondary objective is to identify pharmacodynamic markers associated with each drug and biomarkers for evidence of efficacy or lack of thereof.

In this study, we explored the hypothesis that osteoarthritic cartilage matrix can promote chondrogenesis of MSCs. Cartilage matrix was harvested from the health-like parts of osteoarthritic cartilage tissue. Cartilage fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Histological analysis showed a round and elongated cell appearance with positive Alcian blue staining of cartilage matrix formation in the constructs. However, the cells in fibrin glue only were condensed like MSCs in pellet culture. Immunohistochemical staining was abundantly positive for type II collagen in neo-cartilage regions of cartilage fragment-fibrin glue-MSC constructs, while the constructs without cartilage fragments were negative in staining for type II collagen. The gene expressions of type II collagen in the constructs with 60 mg fragments were significantly elevated after 4 weeks of implantation. Conversely, constructs without cartilage fragments failed to express type II collagen, which indicated that MSCs could not differentiate into a chondrogenic lineage. In conclusion, we demonstrated the effects of osteoarthritic cartilage matrix in promoting chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. This was a favorable method without exogenous growth factors induction."

Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, aGVHDremains a common and life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Corticosteroids are still acted as the first-line treatments of aGVHD, with a response rate of 50-80. However, those who failed to initial therapy only have 10-30% long-term survival.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from many tissues, such as bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Such cells possess the capacity to suppress immunological responses, support hematopoiesis and repair tissues. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly for preventing and treating GVHD. Although the results are still controversy, most prospective and retrospective data suggest that MSCs are effective to aGVHD.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors combined with CD25 monoclonal antibody and calcineurin inhibitors in treating patients with aGVHD."

                              "Musculoskeletal conditions are common sources of pain. Specifically, osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations).\n\nThis research study involves the participant being randomly placed into one of two groups; one group will have cells taken from one hip, and the other will have cells taken from both hips. Both of these approaches are performed in clinics currently, and both are considered to be standard of care. All bone marrow collected for the purposes of this study will be obtained by the principal investigator while performing the standard procedure. In obtaining these sample the physicians will abide by the standard of care set forth for the Bone Marrow Aspiration Concentrate procedure."

In this study, a 20 million total hMSC dose and a 100 million total hMSC dose will be randomly allocated administered via the Biocardia Helical infusion system in a blinded manner.\n\nThe technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium, which is often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts9, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent a highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

It will also aid in the better understanding of the role of stem cell therapy in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson disease. The safety outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body. While the efficacy results if encouraging, would mean an improvement in the disability associated with PD and reduction in the life-time care and treatment provided to this category of patients in Jordan and the Arab region."

                              "Umbilical cord blood is a source of blood-forming cells that can be used for transplantation. The major problem with this type of transplant is the small number of blood-forming cells available in each cord unit, which may delay the \"take\" of the graft in the recipient. A strategy to overcome this problem is to give 2 cord blood units, increasing the number of cord blood cells in one of them in the laboratory before they are transplanted. This is done in order to increase their number. The expansion of 1, but not both, of the cord blood units will allow the research team to decide more effectively whether the laboratory expansion is responsible for the speed and content of the \"take.\" At this time, no proof exists that this expansion technique will improve the performance of the cord blood specimens.\n\nIn order to collect a larger expansion of the numbers of cord blood cells, recent research suggests that growing the cord blood cells on a layer of bone marrow stromal cells increases the number of expanded cells which can be collected. In the body, these stromal cells form a matrix or \"spider web\" in the bone marrow. Blood-forming bone marrow cells (looking like dewdrops) grow on this stromal cell matrix (spider web) and are nurtured by the stromal cells. In this research study, researchers will either collect marrow stromal cells from a family member through a bone marrow aspiration, or they will use \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells that have been collected from a healthy donor. These \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells were grown and frozen by Mesoblast Systems. These stromal cells from either your family member or \"off-the-shelf\" will hopefully improve the performance of the cord blood cells after they are given to you.\n\nPlacement of central venous catheter for collection of \"back-up\" peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC):\n\nBefore you have back-up PBPC collected or you receive chemotherapy, you will require placement of a hollow plastic tube (catheter) into a large vein inside your body. This catheter will be used to draw blood and to give medications and fluids. The catheter is inserted through the skin in the upper chest and extends to a point above the right side of your heart. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.\n\nCollection of back-up stem cells:\n\nBecause collecting additional cells from the donor of the cord blood is not possible if the transplant with cord blood fails, a back-up PBPC or bone marrow sample to ensure recovery of your marrow function will be collected from you and frozen before the high dose chemotherapy begins. This specimen will only be used if doctors think it is necessary.\n\nPeripheral blood progenitor cell collection (Leukapheresis):\n\nBefore collection of the PBPC, you will be treated with a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which will cause the important stem cells in the marrow to move the peripheral blood where they will be collected. This medication is given as a shot under the skin once a day for 3-7 days, at which time your PBPC will be collected from your central catheter during a 3-4 hour outpatient procedure. This procedure is standard, and is called leukapheresis. You will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.\n\nBone Marrow Collection:\n\nIf the leukapheresis cannot be performed successfully, you will receive general anesthesia in the operating room and will have multiple needle sticks of the hip bones in order to collect bone marrow. Less than 5 percent of your bone marrow will be taken. This procedure, if done, will also require you to sign a separate consent form.\n\nSelection of alternate back-up donor:\n\nIf your own back-up bone marrow or back-up PBPC cannot be collected, a family member will be asked to serve as a back-up donor or an identified third cord blood unit may be used should both the cord blood units fail to function. A back-up donor or product will be required for you to participate in this research\n\nSelection of a stromal cell donor for cord cultures:\n\nIn this study, researchers will identify a donor for the stromal cells. This will either be a family member or from an unrelated healthy donor whose marrow stromal cells were collected, grown, and frozen by Mesoblast Systems (off-the-shelf). If your family member is used, they will collect about 7 tablespoons of bone marrow from them.This family member's tissue type (HLA antigens) does not exactly match yours. That bone marrow will be taken to the laboratory where over 3-4 weeks, marrow stromal cells will be grown. These marrow stromal cells produce vitamin-like growth factors that may help your cord blood cells expand to greater numbers. If a family member is not appropriately HLA matched, does not meet eligibility, is not a candidate due to health reasons, or if the participant's disease is getting worse so that there is not enough time to grow the family member's marrow cells into marrow stromal cells, then \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells that have been collected from a healthy donor will be used for the procedure. These \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells were grown and frozen by Mesoblast Systems. These cells have been safely given to patients with peripheral vascular disease, but their use in this study is considered investigational.\n\nYour bone marrow transplant doctors will assign you to one of 3 chemotherapy treatments, which are discussed below.\n\nHigh-dose chemotherapy treatment (Myeloablative):\n\nIf you are between 1 and 55 years of age and can receive high-dose chemotherapy, or you are between 55 and 65 years old and your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine, clofarabine, busulfan, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and total body irradiation.\n\nYou will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over 60 minutes as an outpatient usually during the week before admission. If the test dose cannot be given as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -9 for IV fluids and the busulfan test dose. This low-level \"test\" dose of busulfan is to check how the level of busulfan in your blood levels changes over time. This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the target blood level that matches your body size.\n\nAbout 11 samples of blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of busulfan. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These blood samples will be drawn at various timepoints starting before the Busulfan infusion and continuing over approximately the next 11 hours. The blood samples will be repeated again with the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment. Each sample will be about 1 teaspoon of blood. A temporary heparin lock will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.\n\nIf you received the test dose as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8 and will receive fluids by vein. On Days -7 through -4, you will receive by vein fludarabine over 1 hour, clofarabine by vein over 1 hour, and busulfan by vein over 3 hours. You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. On Day -3, you will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation. You will \"rest\" (not receive chemotherapy drugs) on Days -2 and -1. Day 0 is the day of transplantation, so the negative day numbers are used to label the treatment days before transplant.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nLower-dose chemotherapy treatment (Non-myeloablative):\n\nIf you are older than 55 and 80 years of age or less, or are of any age with a pre-existing medical condition that prevents you from receiving high dose chemotherapy, you will receive fludarabine- cyclophosphamide-ATG-total body irradiation. You will receive cyclophosphamide as a single dose on Day -6. Fludarabine will be given once a day for 4 days in a row (Days -6 through -3). You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. You will also receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation on Day -1. Day 0 is the day of transplantation. Rituximab may be given on Day -9 if appropriate for your disease.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nReduced Intensity chemotherapy treatment:\n\nIf you are between the ages of 1 and 80 years old (and the study doctors think this would keep you from receiving the full myeloablative therapy), if you cannot receive low-dose total body irradiation, and if your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine-melphalan-ATG. Starting on Day -5 you will receive fludarabine given once a day for 4 days in a row (Days -5 through -2). You will receive Melphalan as a single dose on Day -2. You will receive ATG on Days -3 and -2. Day 0 is the day of transplantation.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nExpansion of cord blood:\n\nOn Day -14, one of your two cord blood units will be thawed in the MD Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory and expanded over a layer of marrow stromal cells from your family member or from \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells. The expansion will continue for about 2 weeks and when complete, the cells will be given to you on Day 0 as described below. A small amount of cord blood cells (less than 3%) will be used for laboratory procedures that measure the quality of the product.\n\nThe CliniMACS System is a medical device that is used to separate types of blood cells from blood that is removed from the body during leukapheresis. These separated cells are processed for use in treatments such as stem cell transplants.\n\nTransplantation of cord blood:\n\nTwo (2) days after completion of high or lower-dose therapy (Day 0), both units of cord blood (the expanded and the unexpanded cord) will be infused into you (one at a time) through your catheter. The unexpanded cord will be thawed and infused first, followed by the infusion of the cells that were expanded in the lab. Each unit will take about 30 minutes to infuse. You will then be hospitalized until your marrow function is restored enough. This usually takes between 3-6 weeks. During this time, you will receive a variety of medications, transfusions, and other standard procedures aimed at decreasing the risks of this procedure, such as graft vs. host disease (GVHD).\n\nGraft versus host disease (GVHD) preventive therapy:\n\nGVHD results from a reaction of the transplanted cord blood cells against certain tissues in your body. In an attempt to prevent or decrease the severity of GVHD, you will receive 2 drugs. Mycophenolate will be given through your catheter 2 times per day (morning and evening) on Days -3 through Day 100. Tacrolimus will be given as a 24-hour continuous infusion over 3-6 weeks. Around Day 30 or 40 (after engraftment), the tacrolimus will be changed to pills given once a day for 180 days (6 months). If GVHD is present, tacrolimus may then be continued longer. The number of tacrolimus pills may vary according to the blood levels of the drug, but usually are between 1-5 pills. Your dose of tacrolimus can be gradually lowered around Day 180 if no GVHD is present. This medicine is used for 6-9 months (longer if chronic GVHD occurs).\n\nYou will remain on study as long as your disease does not return. If your disease returns, you will be taken off study and you may be offered participation in another study or other standard treatments.\n\nFollow-up after transplant:\n\nAfter you leave the hospital, you will be seen regularly in the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation at MD Anderson. The frequency of the visits may vary, but may be as often as daily. Routine blood (1-2 tablespoons) and urine tests will be performed. The frequency of blood tests may also vary, but may be performed daily. You will have bone marrow samples collected before transplant and then as needed during the first 100 days after transplant, every 3 months during the first year after transplant, and then once a year while you are on study. After that, bone marrow samples will be collected once a year, indefinitely. These samples are being collected to look for tumor (as a staging test) and to looFk for chimerism (the percent of tumor cells detectable that can predict graft failure and/or relapse). To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.\n\nParticipants with lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease will need a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed before transplant, then as needed during the first 100 days after transplant, and then every 3 months for the first year after transplant. After that, these scans will be done yearly. You will be on study for 1 year but then will be followed yearly as is standard of care.\n\nThis is an investigational study. All treatment drugs given to you are FDA approved and commercially available. The CliniMACS device is not FDA approved. At this time, it is being used in research only. Up to 125 patients may take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

Current literature has demonstrated that adult stem cells (ASCs) are mobilized into peripheral circulation as a heterogeneous population of cells following tissue injury. The significance of this heterogeneity has not yet been defined. Other studies have shown ASCs augment tissue repair under appropriate conditions. This proposal will begin to elucidate the mechanism of ASC activation, mobilization and localization to sites of injury. This study will use flow cytometry to identify subsets of ASCs mobilized in response to tissue injury and compare this response to the patient's demographics, comorbidities, in hospital morbidities, and mortality. Patients with thermal burns will be used as a model of tissue injury given the quantity of tissue injured and the robust signal generated from this injury. ASCs are currently being investigated as adjuncts to tissue repair involving a host of tissues, including cardiac, neural, and renal. The identification of a specific subset of ASCs selectively mobilized in response to tissue injury would alter all studies involving ASCs in tissue repair and necessitate the identification and targeting of subsets selectively mobilized in response to injury to each particular tissue."

                              "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and peripheral CD34 positive cells. Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Singapore. This will be a Phase I/II study with the main emphasis on the safety profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."

                              "Tendon disorders compromise pain free activity and often progress to chronic pain with a major impact on quality of life. More than 85,000 patients each year see their general practitioner (GP) with Achilles Tendinopathy (AT) which affects the lower leg in young and middle aged adults. The main treatment is physiotherapy, although surgery is eventually considered in 25-45%of patients, an intervention that requires several months of immobilisation and has unpredictable outcomes.\n\nOther treatments include, shockwave therapy, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (a blood injection of platelet rich plasma) and steroid injections, but other than physiotherapy non have been shown to be better than placebo. There is a need for improved nonsurgical treatments. There is an established treatment in horses that involves injection of the horses own stem cells into the tendon, which has been shown to be effective but has never been used in man. We wish to translate the technology to humans and propose a pilot phase II trial to establish the safety of stem cells implanted in diseased human tendon. We aim to study 10 patients with chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy to assess safety as our primary outcome measure. In addition we capture clinical outcomes scores and ultrasound appearances. Other than the stem cell injection, all assessments will be non invasive. Participants will be otherwise healthy adults, aged 18-70 and recruited from routine outpatient clinics at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, presenting with a painful heel, diagnosed by a specialist as Achilles tendinopathy, and having already undergone a minimum of 6 months of physiotherapy. Each participant will have 6 months follow up. This study will help inform a larger clinical trial in the future for which a further ethics application will be made."

                              "Chondral knee lesions are frequent and produce important functional limitations and arthrosis development. Arthrosis is one of the most important causes of disability and its treatment with prosthetic surgery is associated with a high cost, and is not free of other complications. Several studies of cell therapy with autologous chondrocytes have shown efficacy in the treatment of this type of lesions, and currently is a common technique for the treatment of focal lesions of articular cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte transplant is associated with morbidity of the cartilage sample removal, which needs intra-articular surgery, and the limited tissue sample for culture. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) have demonstrated chondrocytic differentiation and have been used in animal models for articular cartilage repair. Adipose tissue yields more ASC than chondrocytes are obtained from cartilage, and liposuction is simple and with less adverse events than arthroscopy. It is worth mentioned that culture conditions are less stringent for ASC than for chondrocytes, in terms of number of passages to obtain the amount of cells needed for implantation.\n\nWe propose a randomized clinical trial, in which we compare the surgical implantation of either autologous chondrocytes or autologous ASC to treat chondral knee lesions."

                              "Diabetes mellitus refers to disorders in which the body has trouble controlling its blood glucose levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is being studied in this trial, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own immune system attacks and destroys the cells that make insulin. These cells are called beta cells. As beta cells are destroyed, less insulin can be made. This causes blood sugar levels to increase above normal and can cause life-threatening hypo- and hyper-glycemic reactions. For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to help control their blood sugar levels. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can lead to a variety of serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, blindness, amputations, kidney disease, and nerve damage. Insulin is the primary method of controlling diabetes by regulating blood glucose levels, but it may not reverse or prevent disease progression. The active ingredient in PROCHYMAL\u00ae is adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have been shown to interact with the immune cells in the body, reducing inflammation and assisting in tissue repair. This study will help determine whether MSCs can protect normal pancreatic tissue from autoimmune attack and repair damaged pancreatic tissue, leading to an increase in insulin production and decrease in circulating blood glucose. The characteristics and biologic activity of PROCHYMAL\u00ae, along with a good safety profile in human trials to date, suggest that PROCHYMAL\u00ae may be a good candidate for addressing Type 1 Diabetes."

Stem cell therapies are rapidly progressing fields and have shown immense promise in the treatment of lots of disease, including aging and premature ovarian failure. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intra vein injection of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells(hAMSCs) in women suffered from infertility caused by DOR. The hAMSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro and qualified by National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China. The serum of each patient was kept and sent for laboratory test before the transplantation. The biomarkers of hAMSCs were detected again before transplantation. The hAMSCs were transplanted via venous in the dorsum of hand. The outcomes of patients were examined during and after the injection. The patients are monitored for hormones, follicles stimulated with minimal stimulation, number of oocyte retrieval and embryos In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)."

Donors\u00b4sorology wil have to be negative for syphilis, Chagas disease, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C, HIV 1 and 2, and Cytomegalovirus.\n\nThe adipose tissue-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) that wil be extract on healthy volunteers will be isolate, culture and samples will be process at Core Cell Technology of Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1. Briefly, the procedures are:\n\n100 ml of adipose tissue will be wash in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco Invitrogen). A one-step digestion by 1 mg/ml collagenase type I (Invitrogen) will be performe for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C during permanent shaking, follow by filtration step through a 100 \u00b5m mesh filter (BD FALCON, BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA, USA). The cell suspension will be centrifuge at 800 g for 10 minutes, and erythrocytes were removed by lysis buffer, pH 7.3.\nThe remaining cells will be wash at 400 g for 10 minutes and then culture at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/cm2 in T75 culture flasks and DMEM-F12 (Gibco Invitrogen) supplemente with 10% of fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml). The culture medium will be replace three days after seeding, and then twice a week.\nASCs will be subculture after reaching 80% confluence, with 0.5% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) solution. Cells will be replate at a density of 4x103 cells/cm2 for expansion11A.\nQuality control of cell suspension sterility will be evaluate by tests to detect bacteria and fungi (Bact / Alert 3D, Biomerieux), endotoxins (Endosafe \u2122 PTS, Charles River) and Mycoplasma (KIT MycoAlert \u2122 PLUS Mycoplasma Detection, Lonza). Cell viability will be performe by flow cytometry using the vital dye 7-AAD (7-Aminoactinomycin D - BD#559925) to determine the percentage of viable cells and Annexin V protein (BD#51-65875X) to determine the percentage of cells in apoptosis. Cytogenetic analysis wil be performe by GTG-banding method.\nCells will be phenotypically characterize by flow cytometry before the clinical application, using the following monoclonal antibodies: FITC-labeled CD14 (BD#555397), CD45 (BD#555482), CD19 (BD#555412), CD44 (BD#555478); PE-labeled CD73 (BD#550257), CD90 (BD#555596), CD166 (BD#559263), PerCP-labeled HLA-DR (BD#551375); APC-labeled CD34 (BD#555824), CD105 (BD#562408), CD29 (BD#559883) all purchased from BD (Pharmingen). At least 100.000 events wil bel acquire on a BD FACSCalibur\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data wil be analyzed using FlowJo 10 (TreeStar) software11A.\n\nAfter the ASCs extraction, isolate, culture and process, the infusion in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes wil be according as describe bellow:\n\nAt the day of infusion, ASCs monolayer wil be dissociate as described above and 1x106 cells/kg of the recipient patient wil be ressuspend in 5 ml of saline solution with 50% albumin and 5% anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution. Cell suspension wil send to the hospital in a cooler with recycled ice.\nPatients that wil receive ASCs wil be admitte to the hospital in the day of the infusion and wil discharge 24 hours after infusion. A single dose of ASCs wil be infuse in a peripheral upper arm vein during 15-20 minutes. Patients wil start takking oral cholecalciferol 2000 UI one day after the ASCs infusion.\n\nSafety Tests: adverse events wil be record during the hospitalization (T0) and at each follow-up outpatient visit (3 [T3], 6 [T6], 12 [T12], 18 [T18], and 24 [T24] months after the ASCs infusion), with clinical and laboratory exams (blood count, lipids, renal and hepatic function, thyroid stimulating hormone, free tyroxine, antithyroglobulin antibody, calcium, phosphorus and 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D, performed with automated biochemical equipment CMD 800 IX1).\n\nClinical and Pancreatic Function Evaluation: Participants wil be followed for 24 months. On the first visit, all patients wil be interviewed and had a physical exam. Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart frequency, frequency of hypoglycemia and insulin dose/kg of body weight wil be evaluate in the first visit (T0) and after 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 6 (T6) 12 (T12) ,18 (18), and 24 (24) months.\n\nInsulin dose adjustments wil be performe at each visit as necessary. All patients wil receive nutritional guidance according to American Diabetes Association recommendations.\n\nBlood samples wil be drawn prio to ASCs infusion and at T1, T3, T6, T12, T18 and T24 for the measurement the Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c. Method: High Performance Liquid Chromatography by boronate affinity). \u03b2-cell function wil be evaluated through C-Peptide measurement (Microparticle Chemiluminescent Immunoassay method, Architect Abbott) after a liquid mixed meal (Glucerna\u00ae), considering the time 0 (basal), 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The area under the curve wil be calculate.\n\nComparison with previous case-control study using only vitamin D supplementation as intervention:\n\nThe investigators wil compare our results with patients previously included in a case-control study that investigated the effects of daily 2000 UI vitamin D without the infusion of cells in individuals with recent onset type 1 diabetes and similar age (> 15 years old), from a different population (S\u00e3o Paulo) in the same country region (Brazilian Southeast). Therefore, the investigators wil establish three different groups for comparison: 1) patients that wil receive ASCs + Vitamin D supplementation; 2) patients that wil receive only vitamin D supplementation; 3) patients that wil receive the conventional treatment for diabetes but any additional experimental treament (ASCs or Vitamin D).\n\nInsulin dose adjustments or withdrawal wil be performed according to glycemic control. Changes in HbA1c, C-Peptide and insulin dose/kg of body weight wil be compare between groups. C-Peptide wil be analyze by immunofluorometric assay (AutoDelfia) at T0 and T6 and T12 and T18 and T24, considering basal and peak stimulated C-Peptide after mixed meal test (Glucerna)."

                              "Frailty syndrome is the most problematic expression of population ageing and profound implications for the planning and delivery of health and social care when population ageing is accelerating rapidly worldwide, from 461 million people older than 65 years in 2004 to an estimated 2 billion people by 2050 . Frailty syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in health and clinical symptoms of exhaustion, weight loss, a feeling of slowing down, and a decrease in functional capacity. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that carries an increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Health study as meeting three out of five phenotypic criteria: low grip strength, self-reported exhaustion, slowed walking speed, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss. Frailty is a disorder of several inter-related physiological systems, including genetic and environmental factors in combination with epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate the differential expression of genes in cells and could be especially important in ageing. Current interventions focus on interdisciplinary approaches which include nutritional supplementation, physical exercise, and cognitive intervention. Clinical studies of these preventative approaches have shown inconsistent and modest benefits, further highlighting the unmet clinical need. Therefore, development of new therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of frailty syndrome in adult patients is of urgent need. A variety of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are currently being tested to treat aging. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are represents an attractive option that addresses the pathophysiology of the syndrome."

Earlier results with use of fetal mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe side effects.\n\nCurrent interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the striatum of the patient."

                              "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, predicted to be the third leading cause of death in adults by 2020. Patients with COPD are characterized with airflow limitation and chronic inflammation, which is caused by cigarette smoking, noxious particles or gases. These inhaled irritants will induce inflammation, emphysema and fibrosis though chronic exposure. The current pharmacological treatment of COPD is symptomatic and is mainly based on bronchodilators, such as selective \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (short-and long-acting), anticholinergics, theophylline, or a combination of these drugs. In patients with continuing exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) may be added in the form of a triple fixed dose combination inhaler that includes ICSs, long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABA) and inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Although current clinical treatment strategies can improve and stabilize COPD states and quality of life, none of them are able to modify the progressive decline in lung function which is the hallmark of this disease. Therefore, development of new therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COPD in adult patients is of urgent need. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of COPD."

If a patient or the treating clinician decides that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians. The investigators defined refractory bipolar depression as depression that failed to respond to two trials (during lifetime) with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizer with proven efficacy in bipolar depression (lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) in adequate doses for at least 6 weeks or until cessation of treatment due to side effects (Schoeyen et al., 2015).\n\nAfter the initial injection, patients will continue maintenance treatment with their current psychiatrist. During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive treatment as usual per their clinician's choice.

                              "For numerous malignant and non-malignant hematological diseases allogeneic hemato\u00acpoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy. One of the major complications is the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). Thirty to eighty percent of patients after HSCT develop aGVHD despite the prophylactic application of different immunosuppressive drugs depending on risk factors such as HLA-match, donor relation, age etc.1-3.\n\nFirst line therapy of aGVHD > grade I consists of steroids at a dose of 2 mg/kg. The response rates to this treatment are only 15-35%4. In case of a steroid refractory aGVHD different therapeutic strategies have been evaluated, but with no satisfactory results so far. The mortality of patients suffering from steroid refractory aGVHD remains at 75-80%, although numerous studies with different treatment strategies have been conducted2-5. Therefore, it remains important to search for new therapeutical strategies for the treatment of aGVHD.\n\nThe first patient to receive mismatched Mesenchymal Stem Cells was a twenty-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia treated with peripheral blood stem cells combined with MSC from her haploidentical father. Lazarus et al. reported on 46 patients who received HSCs and culture-expanded MSCs from HLA-identical siblings. Moderate to severe acute GvHD was observed in 28% of the patients, and chronic GvHD was seen in 61%. The two-year progression-free survival was observed in 53% of the patients. MSC infusion caused no acute or long-term MSC-associated adverse events.\n\nTraditionally, for MSC isolation and expansion, fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented media are used. The use of FCS has however several drawbacks and potential problems. We have therefore established a MSC culture protocol in animal serum free conditions using human platelet lysate and human plasma instead.\n\nThe present phase I/II study is designed to gather further insight into the clinical benefit in 50 patients (adults and children) with GvHD exerted by MSC expanded with human platelet lysate and plasma"

However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.\n\nThe rate of progression also varies for each individual. Common clinical symptoms include knee pain that is gradual in onset and worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain after prolonged sitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment for knee osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options when conservative treatment fails. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis currently exist. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of KOA."

                              "MSCs have been extensively studied and clinically evaluated for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and graft versus host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The variable source of MSCs and the lack of consistency of primary tissue-derived MSCs are major obstacles to reliable translational applications of such therapeutic cell products. Fetal tissue-derived clonal MSCs (cfMSCs) have extended expansion potential and express rich levels of various growth factors, and thus can achieve quality consistency. Careful evaluation of fMSCs in clinical studies has not been conducted. Autoimmune diseases involve aberrant immune responses that harm tissues and organs. GVHD is a serious and often fatal problem associated with HSCT. MSCs have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects. In many studies, MSCs have demonstrated promising beneficial effects that reduce severe autoimmune reactions, diminish symptoms of chronic GvHD and therapy-resistant acute GvHD including steroid-resistant GVHD. The safety and therapeutic effects of phenotype and functionally characterized fMSCs still require extensive clinical evaluation. This study aims to assess the safety and the potential beneficial effects of infusion of various dosages of third party fMSCs for the control of severe symptoms associated with acute and chronic immune-related disorders."

                              "Viral infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. With wide use of HLA-mismatch, unrelated and cord blood donors as alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as the standard prophylaxis of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in HLA-mismatch and unrelated donor transplantation, allo-HSCT recipients are at increasing risk for viral infections.\n\nTill now, CMV remains one of the most important viruses and causes of death in the recipients of allo-HSCT. Approximately 75% of CMV-seropositive recipients develop CMV reactivation, and 20-30% of these patients develop CMV disease without intervention. Ganciclovir is the first-line treatment of CMV diseases. However, bone marrow suppression, which is the main and common side effect, limits the utility of ganciclovir in allo-HSCT recipients. Besides, ganciclovir and other antiviral agents resistance has been reported up to 28%. Since it has been known that specific immune response to CMV is important to control reactivation, CMV-specific CTL has been used in prophylaxis and treatment of CMV viremia in several studies. However, the production of CTL requires time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. In vivo experiment showed that MSCs have antimicrobial activity.\n\nIn this trial, we will use MSCs in the recipients with refractory CMV infections."

                              "Since December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has been fierce and spread rapidly. As of 24:00 on March 4, 2020, China has reported a total of 80567 confirmed cases, 5952 existing critically ill cases, and 3016 dead cases. The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to 26 countries worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 infected patients, especially the critically ill cases.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the COVID-19 published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. Several reports demonstrated that the first step of the HCoV-19 pathogenesis is that the virus specifically recognizes the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by its spike Protein. This receptor is abundant in lung and small intestinal tissues, but is also highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in almost all organs, including the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The main organ injured by the HCoV-19 is the lung. In fact, HCoV-19 can also involve the nervous system, digestive system, urinary system, blood system and other systems. Therefore, when the initial symptom is discomfort of other systems in the early stage, it is often easy to be misdiagnosed and delay treatment. Moreover, the HCoV-19 is a noncellular form consisting of RNA and protein, which cannot be copied independently. It needs to bind to cell surface receptors to enter the cell to complete the replication, and then be released again. Therefore, once the HCoV-19 enters the blood circulation, it can easily spread to all systems throughout the body, which may be the pathological mechanism that the HCoV-19 directly or indirectly causes neurological symptoms.\n\nIt seems that the key to cure the COVID-19 pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung. MSCs, owing to their powerful immunomodulatory ability, may have beneficial effects on preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. MSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate.\n\nHere we conducted an MSC transplantation pilot study to explore their therapeutic potential for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. To explore the effective treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia for the current prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia to find a key and effective clinical treatment means, to fight against the epidemic."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the knee that affects millions of adults throughout the world and is the leading cause of disability. It is a degenerative type of arthritis that occurs most often in patients, as the cartilage in the knee joint gradually wears away. As the cartilage wears away, it becomes frayed and rough, and the protective space between the bones decreases. This can result in bone rubbing on bone and produce painful bone spurs. The patient experiences pain that worsens over time.\n\nAlthough current surgical therapeutic procedures to cartilage repair are clinically useful, they cannot restore a normal articular surface, and in many cases, resulted in the growth of inferior quality fibrocartilage. Therefore, techniques and practices have been developed to collect minimally manipulated bone marrow aspirate (BMA), that contains Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMDMSCs) and other endogenous acellular components, from knee OA patients for autologous transplantation in the treatment of their knee OA.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to study arms to receive a BMA injection to the intra-articular knee, subchondral knee, both intra-articular and subchondral knee, or to receive a corticosteroid injection to the knee. A corticosteroid injection is currently the standard of care for osteoarthritis patients having knee pain. All participants will undergo a procedure. Participants will be blinded as to whether they receive a BMA injection or a corticosteroid injection."

The time frame prior to screening when failure of conservative treatment would have occurred will be one year of symptoms and failure of conservative treatment which includes physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, cortizone injections, or hyaluronic acid injections.\n\nTreatment failure is indicated by Subjects having symptoms of knee pain, swelling, and trouble with activities for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Subjects would only be enrolled if they fail conservative treatment. Usually physical therapy is administered initially for 6 weeks along with an NSAID medication. If that fails, which means that pain and swelling and disability continue, then injection therapy with corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid (HA) is given. Usually the injection is followed up in 6 to 8 weeks post-injection. If that fails, then Orthobiologics will be discussed (at about 4 to 6 months after treatment).\nThe subject must fail at least two conservative treatments, which could include physical therapy and NSAIDs, or physical therapy and injections, or NSAIDs and injections.\nSubjects must have WOMAC and VAS scores of \u226530 and \u22654, respectively at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.\nMale and female subjects of reproductive potential must agree to refrain from sexual activity or use effective birth control for a duration of one week before and three months after initiation of treatment with either active treatment modality.\nSubjects with basal cell, in situ carcinoma, or remote history (i.e., > 3 years ago) history of low-grade cancers (e.g., breast) that were effectively treated may be included.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTibia on femur subluxation greater than 1mm.

                              "The curative potential of Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), when applied as a therapy in the management of hematologic malignancies, specifically, derives from an immunologically driven, graft-versus-tumor effect mediated principally by donor T-cells, and is associated with a lesser risk for relapse when compared to high dose chemo-radio therapy and autologous HCT. Donor derived T-cells are also responsible for mediating the occurrence of GVHD, a common transplant-related complication, affecting a significant percentage of patients undergoing allo-HCT leading to the destruction of host tissues. The standard initial treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD is steroid-based therapy. Unfortunately, many of these patients will become resistant to steroid therapy and will subsequently be treated with second-line immunosuppressive agents. De novo high-risk aGVHD and steroid-refractory aGVHD portends a very poor prognosis; second-line agents frequently prove ineffective, and as a result, survival is < 10% at 5 years. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed to treat aGVHD following allo-HCT, particularly in the setting of de novo high-risk acute or steroid-resistant disease.\n\nDue to the large numbers of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that can be obtained from the umbilical cord, the availability of this tissue, their higher growth rates and expansion capacity, and their immune properties, including: (1) low immunogenicity and lack of stimulation of allogeneic T-lymphocyte proliferation, (2) suppression of the proliferation of activated T-lymphocytes, (3) increased production of regulatory T-cells, and (4) a shift in the immune response towards tolerance, Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSC) may be a preferred option for MSC.\n\nThe rationale for cell dosing in this protocol is based on published data from Kebriaei, et al. Dosing at 2 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight produced a complete response in 87.5% of the treated patients. Dosing at a level 4 times higher (8 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight) produced no improvement in complete response results. However, the higher dose produced some partial response and no patient failed to respond to therapy. Therefore, the Phase I study for MSCTC-0010 is designed to increase the dose of WJMSC from 2 \u00d7 10^6 MSC to 10 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight, assuming no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at the lower dose."

Some concerns exist about the heterogeneity of these nonclonal MSCs that are isolated and expanded by the conventional density-gradient centrifugation method. Recently, we developed a new protocol, called the subfractionation culturing method (SCM), to generate single-cell-derived clonal MSC (cMSC) lines from whole bone marrow aspirate without employing any centrifugation step for mononuclear cells and enzyme treatment process. This method allowed us to rapidly establish single-cell-derived human clonal MSC (hcMSC) lines from raw bone marrow aspirates and to establish a library of these hcMSC lines (Song et al., 2008).\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of allogeneic cMSCs established by the SCM and manufactured in GMP facility. This phase I clinical trial is a multicenter, single dose study of cMSC (1 x 10e6 cMSCs/Kg recipient's bodyweight). Clonal MSCs will be infused to acute or chronic GVHD patients via an intravenous injection. Every patients will receive the same treatment"

The result of a survey of 5 regions in Southeast Asia showed that 39-72% of patients with DPN had severe or very severe impact on their quality of life. For the treatment of DPN, conventional drug therapy can almost only target a single pathogenesis and cannot treat it fundamentally. Therefore, new safe and effective treatment options for DPN are particularly important.\n\nBoth here and abroad, large number of experimental studies have shown that Bone Marrow or Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells have a significant therapeutic effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In 2012, the Department of Endocrinology of Wuhan Central Hospital took the lead in conducting a clinical study of Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells in the treatment of DPN in China. The results of the study showed that the nerve conduction velocity of the lower extremities in most patients was improved within 3 months after treatment compared with before treatment. No serious adverse events occurred during the period. Based on this research of our own. The clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN.\n\nThe investigators will do a Single center, randomization, open trial, controlled clinical trials design to assess treatment with the MSCs compared with the control group. 42 patients with DPN will be recruited in China. 21 patients receive i. m. HUC-MSCs both lower extremities (5 \u00d7 10^6 cells/mL, 1 mL per injection, each injection point is 2 cm apart ,1.0-1.5 cm deep, total amount of injection is estimated based on the surface area of the patient's lower limbs). 21 patients in the control group received i.v. Lipoic Acid Injection (600 mg/d for 15 consecutive days). Both efficacy and Adverse Event (AE) during the 96 weeks follow up."

It is clear that there is a significant unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies to treat moderate to severe COPD. This patient population has a high mortality rate and requires frequent hospitalizations due to disease-related exacerbations. Based on severity distribution estimates, approximately 70% of all current COPD patient have either moderate or severe COPD. COPD has no known cure, thus current therapeutic intervention is aimed at providing relief of symptoms. Oxygen therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve survival. Smoking cessation has been shown to slow the rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decline and COPD progression. In general patient are treated with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids, but again, these measures do not provide any significant benefit regarding disease progression or prognosis. The characteristics and biologic activity of Prochymal\u2122, along with a good safety profile in human trials to date, suggest that Prochymal\u2122 may be a good candidate for addressing this unmet medical need."

                              "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease involving primarily the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. The main clinical features are back pain and progressive stiffness of the spine. Oligoarthritis of the hips and shoulders, enthesopathy, and anterior uveitis are common, and involvement of the heart and lungs is rare. The current understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder is limited.It mainly about to hereditary susceptibility (eg HLA-B27),infection and autoimmunity.\n\nAlthough traditional drugs, such as Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs such as methotrexate, salicylazosulfapyridine OR thalidomide) and steroids have been used in the treatment of AS, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response to these drugs is not satisfied. Addition, the severe side effects of these drugs have also been observed. The management of AS patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed. Although the application of TNF alpha receptor inhibitor (such as Etanercept) has got the success in the early treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, the tolerance to this biological agent make the therapy to this disease rather difficult. Recently, owning to its immunoregulatory, immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties, the infusion of human MSCs isolated from human bone marrow have been a promising and effective treatment to AS patients. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC transplantation in the AS patients and compare the efficiency with the Etanercept to treat AS patients.\n\nThis study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MSC transplant therapy (experimental group) or Etanercept therapy (control group). Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. The experimental group will receive infusion per week in the first 4 weeks and every two weeks in the second 8 weeks, totally for 12 weeks. After 3 months, patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After 12 weeks (Phase I) and 48 weeks (Phase II) from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated."

                              "Background:\n\nXerostomia is the diagnosis of the subjective feeling of dry mouth. Xerostomia can coexist with or exist without a reduced production of saliva, although xerostomia is first perceived when unstimulated whole saliva flow rate is reduced by more than 40-50%. In this context, a subnormal or pathologically reduced saliva production (hyposalivation) will severely diminish the quality of life and lead to severe dental decay. The two main causes of grave xerostomia are Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Radiation therapy plays a central role in the curative treatment of most upper head and neck cancers, either as a single modality or in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery, and the prevalence of xerostomia after head and neck radiation ranges from 74 to 85%.\n\nRadiation therapy increases local tumor control significantly along with the chance of survival, but despite the more advanced methods of radiation therapy, Intensity-Modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a significant proportion of the radiation is deposited in the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. The decrease of saliva secretion after radiation therapy predisposes the patients to a variety of conditions. These are either directly or indirectly a result of the decreased production of saliva and include xerostomia, impairment of the normal oral functions (talking, chewing, and swallowing) due to insufficient wetting, and reduced lubrication of mucosal surfaces and the ingested food which impairs nutrition. Furthermore, the oral mucosa can become dry, making the oral mucosa vulnerable, which may lead to frictional trauma and ulceration. In addition, a reduced salivary flow results in a reduced \"rinsing\" of the entire oral cavity, thus leading to microbial overgrowth, which in addition to other factors may result in rapid dental decay, dental erosion, and oral candidiasis (thrush).\n\nStem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types. For more than ten years, researchers have investigated the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage and several groups have addressed the use of MSCs or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in preclinical studies of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.\n\nThe research group has completed an encouraging randomized-controlled pilot study (MESRIX-I) with 30 patients assessing the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded autologous ASCs for radiation-induced xerostomia in an effort to regenerate the function of the salivary glands (EudraCT nb:2014-004349-29). The results of this study show most importantly that the treatment is safe without any serious adverse events (SAE) and no systemic reactions, and secondly, the patients treated with stem cells have a promising enhanced production of saliva of 33%-50%. Furthermore, the research group has shown that the stem cell group gained vital quality of life measures compared with the placebo group in the form of diminished trouble in eating.\n\nThe research group has furthermore recently investigated the safety of allogenic ASCs for the treatment of xerostomia (MESRIX-II) with a clinical safety and feasible trial (EudraCT nb: 2018-003856-19). The study included ten patients who received intraglandular injections of allogeneic ASCs. No serious treatment-related adverse reaction occurred, and the efficacy data was similar to the results from our first trial with autologous ASCs.\n\nResearch hypothesis Treatment with ASCs will result in an improvement of the participant's unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rate and ameliorate the xerostomia and increase quality of life.\n\nStudy aim The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.\n\nStudy design The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ASCs as a treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia for previous head and neck cancer patients.\n\nMethod Patients between the age of 18-70 years previously treated with radiation for a head and neck cancer and a clinically evaluated reduced salivation and hyposalivation, evaluated by a screening, can be included. Each participant will be double-blindly randomized to receive either allogeneic ASCs or placebo consisting of CryoStor10 (BiolifeSolutions), the freeze media for ASCs containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Allogeneic ASCs are provided from the Cardiology Stem Cell Centre (CSCC) at Rigshospitalet.\n\nPatients will be evaluated on salivary gland function and saliva flow rate by sialometry. Both unstimulated whole saliva and stimulated whole saliva will be collected. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the following on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by ionic balance estimation, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride, total protein and selected proteins, and amylase. For evaluation of the participants\u00b4 perception of xerostomia, the participants will answer validated questionnaires in Danish (EORTC QLQ Module for H&N-35 and XQ) at baseline and after four months. These patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires are essential, validated tools for estimating the degree of quality of life (QoL) and xerostomia.\n\nRecruitment of MESRIX-III participants and obtaining informed consent MESRIX-III participants (recipients/placebo) will be recruited through the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Rigshospitalet and Oncology Departments at Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital, and through our databases on head and neck cancer patients. The investigator will send a letter to eligible patients who have been treated and followed for their previous cancer disease. Eligible patients can also contact the investigators or a trained member of the MESRIX-III study by phone or by a specific study e-mail (regionh-stamcelle.rigshospitalet@regionh.dk) if the eligible patients wish to receive a letter with further information. Subsequently, the principal investigator or a trained member of the MESRIX-III study group will contact patients by phone and inquire about their interest in participating in the research project.\n\nIf the eligible patients have an interest in participating in the project, the eligible patients will be invited to an interview at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Rigshospitalet for further information concerning the trial. In the written information material, besides material about the trial, the pamphlets \"Rights of test subjects in a health scientific research project\" and \"before decision\" will be included. The right to bring counsel to the information interview will likewise be explained. Motivated patients referred from doctors in other parts of Denmark and patients who approach our department with an interest in participation in the stem cell research will also be offered information about the trial. Patients from all parts of Denmark can be included if the participants pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria described below. However, transportation and accommodation cannot be provided.\n\nThe information interview will take place in an undisturbed environment with the principal investigator or trained member of the MESRIX-III study group, who has the professional qualifications to communicate the content of the research project, and who will clearly explain that it is a request to participate in a health science research project. The participant will be given oral information about the project in layman's terms on the basis of the written information, and any questions will be answered. The oral information will be adapted to the participant's requirements, and it will be explained without the use of technical terms. Participants will be informed of the right to reflection following the information interview. Participants will likewise be informed of the opportunity to get feedback on the scientific results but will also be informed that no new information on the individual participant's disease or prognosis will be obtained. The potential participants for MESRIX-III will be contacted by telephone by the responsible physician for final commitment to participate. If participants are still interested in participating in the project, an appointment is made where a medical history is taken, and where the remaining trial appointments will be planned in agreement with the participant, and here the participants and the responsible physician will sign the medical consent form.\n\nEvaluation, reporting, and recording of adverse events All adverse events (AEs) are monitored and recorded along with concomitant medicine at the scheduled follow-up (day one, and 4 months after the intervention). AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the clinical trial participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment (ASC/placebo). AEs will be assessed and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 guidelines (CTCAEv5.0). Thus, all adverse events are recorded with CTCAE grade. All grade 3 and grade 4 events and incidents considered related to this trial will be reported to the sponsor by the investigator immediately after the events are discovered.\n\nAn adverse reaction (AR) is defined as any untoward or unintended response in a participant to an investigational medical product (IMP) which is related to any dose administered to that subject.\n\nAn adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is stated as all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADR.\n\nSerious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR), or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), means any AE, AE, SUSAR, respectively, that:\n\nResults in death or\n\nA serious deterioration in health that\n\nResulted in life-threatening illness or injury\nRequired hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nResulted in permanent impairment of body structure or body function\nResulted in medical or surgical treatment to prevent the above\nLead to foetal death, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other negative effect on the foetus\nAnything the Principal Investigator deems to be of Clinical serious significance\n\nMedical judgment will be exercised by the primary investigator together with the sponsor whether an AE or AR should be classified as serious in other situations.\n\nThe included participants will be instructed to contact the principal investigator or a special trained person from the research group in case of events with possible relation to the trial treatment within the main study period.\n\nThe principal investigator will immediately (within maximum 24 hours after receiving the information) inform the sponsor if SAR, SAE or serious suspected adverse reactions occurs. The sponsor will report SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) to the Danish Medicines Agency and the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics within 15 days of occurrence and 7 days in case of death or life-threatening issue. Unexpected reactions are defined as reactions that are not described in the section \"Reference Safety information\" of this protocol. All other unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported within 15 days after the sponsor becomes aware of these.\n\nAll SARs that have occurred during the trial will be reported to The Danish Medicines Agency, The Danish Patient Safety Authority, and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (if appropriate) once a year by the sponsor.\n\nThe sponsor will annually send a concise review and evaluation of pertinent safety information, a Development Safety update report (DSUR) collected during the reporting period related to the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA).\n\nAfter completion of the trial, the sponsor will after 90 days inform the Danish Medicines Agency that the study is completed. Within a year, the sponsor will submit trial results to the board, according to the law on drugs (Lov om l\u00e6gemidler) \u00a7 89. 2, No. 4\n\nReference safety information (RSI) Adverse events with possible relation to injection of ASCs: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious\n\nAdverse events with relation to similar procedures and in MESRIX-I: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%; Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%; Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%; Not serious Infection of the salivary gland; 0.5-5%; Not serious Bleeding/hematoma in the salivary gland; 1-5%; Not serious\n\nThe above numbers and AEs are based on the previous phase I-II trial (EudraCT: 2014-004349-29) and on the literature cited and described in the section \"Risk Assessment\". In the previous study by the research group, MESRIX-I, with autologous ASCs no SAR or SUSARs were detected, so any SAR in this study will be reported as a SUSAR.\n\nLong-term safety and efficacy follow-up Following Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) under EMEA draft from January 2018 on safety and efficacy (S&E) follow-up and risk management of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), the MESRIX-III participants will be invited to a follow-up of efficacy and ARs one year after the intervention (ASCs/placebo). Longer follow-up is not needed based on the reported long-term safety described in the section.\n\n\"Risk Assessment\". Follow-up will include basic ear, nose, and throat examination, fiberscope, ultrasound of submandibular glands, sialometry, and blood samples. Data from the electronic medical journals and national pathology database will be gathered. It is expected that a number of the participants will have a recurrence of their primary cancer during the study or follow-up period due to the nature of the head and neck cancer. The allogeneic MSCs are believed to be rejected in the recipients, and the stem cells are adult non-pluripotent. However, in case of recurrence of cancer or new primary cancer developments each case will be carefully evaluated and potentially investigated with genetic analysis in an attempt to distinguish whether a tumor is due to recurrence, the administered product, or endogenous tumor formation.\n\nSample size and power considerations From MESRIX-I it appeared to be realistic to increase saliva production for whole unstimulated salivary flow (in milliliter(ml)/minut) rate by about 33% or in absolute numbers from 0.125 to 0.151 after 1 month and 0.155 after 4 months. The power calculation is based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. This means that the total number of patients included would have to be 100 (50 in each group) for a paired t-test. 10-20 additional participants may be included to compensate for dropout during the study period. The investigators believe that a 33% increase in whole, unstimulated salivary flow rate is clinically important and also realistic to detect.\n\nEthical considerations The trial is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration. The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency (DPA) will be requested permission to conduct the study. Moreover, the Danish Medicines Agency will be requested approval, and the trial will be monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit (Birgitte Gr\u00f8n). Each volunteer (MESRIX-III participants) is required to give written informed consent before he/she can be included in the study. Information obtained about participants' health, other purely private matters, and other confidential information is covered by professional secrecy. No project participant has a personal financial incentive to implement the described project. The samples will be analyzed and stored in Denmark.\n\nRisk assessment When the study participants in MESRIX-III will receive either ASCs or placebo into the large salivary glands the risk of adverse events such as infection and bleeding is estimated to be below 0.5% when using similar procedures. In our previous studies, none of the 40 participants developed adverse reactions.\n\nThe MESRIX-III participants may also experience some pain briefly during injection of the transplant product (ASCs or placebo).\n\nA theoretical risk of a possible carcinogenic effect in the treatment of MSC/ASCs has been discussed. This is due to their production of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), a factor produced by the MSC/ASCs. These considerations are particularly relevant since ASCs are used in participants previously diagnosed with cancer. However, in model systems of cancer, the effect of MSCs on cancer growth is controversial as MSCs have both been shown to be inhibitory and stimulatory. Further, numerous clinical trials with more than 1000 participants have been conducted with MSCs in different participant populations, and no increase in the incidence of cancer has been detected. These studies include local injection of MSCs. With respect to the use of ex vivo expanded MSCs, despite extensive research, there is no data indicating malignant transformation of expanded human MSCs/ASCs.\n\nData collection Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report Form (CRF).\n\nThe study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring, audit, and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA for the processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation. Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet.\n\nData will be analyzed with R. Our data will be kept securely in the electronic data capture system (EDC) Redcap. All data will be directly entered. The trial will be completed when all data is collected.\n\nAll results will be stored and analyzed electronically; participants' anonymity is ensured in accordance with the national data legislation. After completion of the study, data will be stored in an anonymous form. Data containing social security numbers will be kept locked and inaccessible to unauthorized persons.\n\nSubject confidentially The investigator is obliged to ensure that participant anonymity is protected and maintained. On the CRF\u00b4s subjects should be identified by their initials and a subject study number only, Documents that are not for submission (e.g., signed informed consent forms) will be kept in strict confidence by the principal investigator. In compliance with the GCP Guidelines, it is required that the investigator and the institution permit authorized representatives of a monitoring company direct access to reviewing subjects' original medical records for verification of study-related procedures and data. All information obtained concerning this protocol regarding participants is protected according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)."

Patients receiving HCT can develop a life-threatening condition called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donor T cells from the donor bone marrow recognize host cells as \"foreign\" and initiate an inflammatory immunological response. The standard of care for treatment of acute GVHD consists of intravenous delivery of methylprednisolone starting on day 1 and continuation of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. This regimen of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may relieve symptoms of GVHD, but some patients are refractory to current standard of care treatment. For treatment-refractory patients with grades III-IV GVHD mortality is approximately 80%. A therapy that could effectively suppress the immunological response from GVHD and help repair the damaged tissue could significantly decrease the mortality rate from this disease."

Human and animal studies have shown that the cells do not require any donor-recipient matching. The cells may have both immunosuppressive and healing benefits in Crohn's disease. The cells naturally migrate specifically to sites of inflammation, so their effects are believed to be local and self-limiting rather than systemic.\n\nProtocol 603 is enrolling subjects to evaluate the ability of PROCHYMAL to induce remission in subjects with moderate-to-severe disease (Crohn's disease activity index -- CDAI -- of between 250 and 450, inclusive) who have failed or been intolerant of at least one drug in each of the steroid, immunosuppressant, and biologic classes."

Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and determine its suitability as a form of treatment."

                              "Osteoarthritis of the knee (Knee Osteoarthritis, Knee OA) is a joint disease that primarily affects cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within the joint. In people who suffer from knee OA, articular cartilage top is broken down and worn away, resulting in the underlying bones to rub against each other. This friction can cause pain, joint swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM). Eventually, the joint may become deformed and bone spurs may form around the edges. With the advances in biotechnology, cell therapy in the application of cartilage reconstruction has gradually matured. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) injection of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for knee OA. The same cell products used in this trial have been applied in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in Taiwan for the treatment of critical limb ischemia, and so far no treatment-related adverse effect has been observed. In the current trial, allogeneic bone marrow MSCs of up to 4 donors will be isolated. BM MSCs are expanded and applied for a phase I/IIa study in treating 15-24 recipient patients with knee OA. The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first stage is a traditional 3+3 open dose-escalated study design with three cohorts of dosing groups: (1) 1 x 10^7 cells, (2) 5 x 10^7 cells and (3) 10 x 10^7 cells. At the second stage, knee OA patients will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as determined by the results of the first stage. All the study subjects will be followed up to 6 months (24 weeks) after the treatment for safety and preliminary efficacy evaluation, which the latter will include both clinical and imaging study assessments."

In addition, many children who were recovered from this disease are suffering from many side effects such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nThe purpose of BPD treatment is to make a baby be able to do spontaneous breathing and to spontaneous breathing a baby needs much energy and because of this a baby may have difficulty to feed. For this reason, medication with steroid, diuretic and respiratory drugs are currently used. However, there is no effective cure so far.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate to pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSC differentiated to bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae is human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells and it is intended to treat premature infants with BPD.

                              "One of the hallmark features of the progression of COVID-19 is lung injury from the viral infection leading to potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. In patients who survive ARDS, regardless of the pathology, there is evidence that their long-term quality of life is adversely affected.\n\nThe rationale for the dose and dosing regimen proposed in this study is based on the safe administration and benefits of this treatment regimen reported to us last year by physicians trying to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. In those reports, the intravenous route of administration was used. It has been reported that dosing every 2 days amplified the benefit of the combination of exosomes and mesenchymal stem cells. It has been suggested based on clinical experience that the exosomes and MSCs are complementary to one another as well as enhancing the innate abilities of both.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, intravenous infusion of a mixture of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 was reported to benefit hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 related ARDS. This study is designed to systematically explore the risk and benefits of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS.\n\nThis is a proof of concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122, versus placebo, for use in the treatment of moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19. This is an add-on treatment study; subjects will be allowed to take standard of care treatments available.\n\nThe study will have two arms (n=10 each):\n\nExperimental/treatment arm: EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 plus standard care\nPlacebo: Cryopreservation media plus standard care\n\nThe study duration would be 5 days of treatment plus 12 weeks follow up."

The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. BM-MSC has also been used to treat human liver diseases such as liver failure and liver cirrhosis. In a phase 1 study, autologous BM-MSC transplantation has potential to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can improve the longer term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well BM-MSC is tolerated and its safety in LC patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times UC-MSC treatment at 4-week intervals.\n\nArm B: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times saline infusions at 4-week intervals.\n\nUC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are infused intravenously. After cell therapy, patients are followed up for 75 months. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin(PA), the rountin blood test are detected at week 12, 24, 48 timepoints.

                              "Septic shock is a devastating illness and the most severe form of infection seen in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is characterized by cardiovascular collapse, failure of organs and is common with severe repercussions including a mortality of 20-40%. Survivors suffer long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models, MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore organ function, and reduce death.\n\nThe Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims, CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300 million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian centres over approximately 2 years."

                              "Bone injuries represent an important world medical problem producing significant healthcare and societal expenditure. While most bone injuries are not severe and are capable of healing through bone regeneration by natural callus formation with standard treatments, severe bone injuries may not heal, becoming an important unmet clinical need.\n\nNon-unions, or pseudarthrosis, may occur in 5% to 20% of long-bone fractures that fail to heal properly after more than 6 months, with morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased expenses. The most commonly accepted standard augmentation to procure fracture and non-union healing consists of autologous bone grafting, obtained from the same patient in a different surgical site and transplanted to the reconstruction site. However, autologous bone grafting has some drawbacks (such as persistent pain, scar, late recovery, limited amount of bone, etc) and a limited regeneration efficacy (success rate of about 74%) and high societal cost. Culture-expanded autologous MSCs combined with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) biomaterial granules have been claimed as a solid regenerative medicine alternative to autologous bone grafting in non-unions, although current data are limited. In this context, the ORTHOUNION initiative focuses on the opportunity to test the hypothesis of superiority of MSC, the investigational ATMP, versus the currently accepted standard therapy, iliac crest bone autograft to biologically augment surgical treatment of long-bone non-unions."

                              "Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is an important perinatal cause of long-lasting neurodevelopmental problems. Recent studies report an incidence of PAIS of 1 per 2300 full-term infants born alive. Adverse consequences of PAIS include hemiplegia, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy and speech problems. In 50-75% of infants, neonatal stroke leads to abnormal neuromotor and -developmental outcome or epilepsy. The estimated annual mortality rate of neonatal stroke is 3.49/100,000 annually. Current treatment options for PAIS mainly focus on controlling convulsions and associated infections. There is no treatment available that leads to reduction of neonatal brain damage in this severely affected group of infants. This leads to life-long consequences of PAIS and forms a large burden for patients and society. The overall aim of this project is to meet this need by developing a cell based treatment strategy. Animal models of neonatal brain injury provide evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of intranasal mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) application in the treatment of PAIS. Additionally, results from human trials with MSCs in the treatment of adult stroke or other pathologic conditions provide evidence that MSC treatment is safe. This project aims at making the first step towards clinical application of MSCs to treat PAIS. Successful completion of this project will provide the first evidence of the safety and feasibility of MSCs to treat brain damage in newborn infants. This study will assess safety and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs, administered by the nasal route, in neonates who suffered from PAIS."

                              "Design Randomized, controlled trial with blinding. To maintain allocation concealment all participants, care givers, trial investigators and outcome assessors except the Blood Bank staff will be blinded to the intervention. Staff from the Blood Bank will not have direct contact with the patients (hereafter the participants) as such.\n\nProject plan For inclusion in the study participants will have their usual medical history taken according to guidelines from the Ear, Nose and Throat Surgical Department, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet.\n\nAll participants will undergo a mini lip-suction, from which MSCs will be ex vivo expanded in a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-approved clean room facility (The Blood Bank, section 2014). When the cells arrive at the Blood Bank, participants will be randomized to either ex vivo expansion of their mesenchymal stem cells or having them frozen for potential later use. Expected ex vivo expansion phase is 3-4 weeks. The purification and isolation will be based on a protocol previously approved for clinical use.\n\nAmount of MSCs required for injection Based on published animal studies the amount given for xerostomia to mice varies from 2 x 105 to 2 x 106 [19]. To convert these mice data to a realistic dose in humans we have extrapolated based on the following data: The volume density of submandibular glands very closely approximates 1 (1.06-1.07 mg/mm3) [27]. In the mice studies on radiotherapy the mean gland weight was approximately 350mg, which corresponds to an approximate volume of 350mm3. Therefore the mouse dose pr. gland volume is approximately 286.000-2.860.000cells pr. cm3 gland (when calculated from either 1 x 105 to 1 x 106). The volume of the submandibular gland in human subjects after radiotherapy is 6.6-7.9cm3 [28]. This corresponds to an approximate dose pr. patient of between 1.9 x 106 to 2.2 x 106, or 1.9 x 107 to 2.2 x 107 cells pr. submandibular gland. From the above assumptions and in order not to give to few cells we have chosen to proceed with the maximum dose corresponding to 2.8*10^6 MSC/cm^3 gland, i.e. a maximum total dose per patient of approximately 4,6 * 10^7 MSCs. However to standardize the dose given to patients, the amount given will be standardized to the size of their submandibular glands, as described below.\n\nInjection of MSCs into submandibular glands Subjects will go to the ENT-department, section 2073 for inpatient procedures. The surgical procedure is done under local anaesthesia using ultrasonic guidance and sterile technique. After receiving the MSC-suspension or placebo-suspension, the surgeon will identify the submandibular glands and inject the suspension MSCs. Calculation of injected number of MSCs pr. participant rests on the following calculation: , where volume is the volume of the submandibular gland, and a gland-volume of app. 7-8cm3 is the norm. Therefore the amount of cells given to each participant will be app. in total. Afterwards the participant will be given a band-aid and over the counter analgesics. The MSCs will be suspended in Isotonic NaCl (0,9 mg/ml) and Human Albumin (HA) 1% to a final volume of 2ml. Placebo will be 2ml of Isotonic NaCl (0,9mg/ml) and HA 1%.\n\nFollow-up MRI of the recipient place will be performed after 3-4 weeks and 3-4 months postoperatively. MRI is used for volume determination of salivary glands and control of recipient place.\n\nAfter 3-4 months, a small biopsy is randomly taken from one of the two salivary glands. The procedure takes place under local anaesthesia. Histology is determined (samples are blinded to the pathologist).\n\nWhen the final MRI, biopsy and salivary function test has been performed approx. 3-4 months after treatment specific study related tests and activities are concluded. To detect late complications or late adverse events all study participants who received MSC-treatment are invited for a check-up 1 year and 3 years after treatment.\n\nSafety, isolation and propagation of MSC The Blood Bank has its cell-tissue approval from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (according to the Danish Tissue Law), as well as a Manufacturer's/Importer's Authorisation regarding Human Medicinal Products, the necessary physical facilities, personnel and operational resources to produce MSCs in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP).\n\nThe MSC product will be tested for recognized surface markers (CD73, CD90, CD105,) using flow cytometry, and undergo general quality checks before the final release (cell viability and tests for microorganisms). With regard to the cultivation of the MSC we will use basal medium supplemented with human platelet lysate from healthy blood donors instead of the former use of animal-derived serum (fetal bovine serum, FBS). This has the following benefits: 1) No likelihood of transfection of both known and unknown animal pathogens, or risk of xeno-immunization 2) Small batch-to-batch variation and thus more consistent growth performance, since each group is prepared from approx. 50 healthy donors.\n\nAll harvest, isolation, expansion, etc. of MSC will be in accordance with GMP regulations. The Blood Bank has clean room facilities approved by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority for GMP compliant cell expansion for clinical use, and all studies will be carried out by specially trained personnel.\n\nAssessment of xerostomia and subjective treatment outcome The subjective effect of the treatment is assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue scale of xerostomia filled out by the patient [31] and a physician-rated questionnaire [32], both carried out before as well as after treatment. Each participant will also be asked about daily symptoms of dry mouth according to the UKU side-effect rating scale item 3.3 [29]. This scale includes four scores where 0 denotes no feeling of dry mouth, 1 denotes a slight feeling of dry mouth, 2 denotes a severe feeling of dry mouth, and 3 denotes troublesome feeling of dry mouth that makes speech and eating difficult.\n\nAssessment of salivary flow rate and objective treatment outcome Changes in the secretion rate of the unstimulated whole saliva in the oral cavity is probably the most important parameter for the biological development of xerostomia and accompanying pathological oral conditions. Whole saliva, e.g., the mixed secretions from the major and minor salivary glands is mixed in the oral cavity. A correct determination of this value is crucial for the assessment of treatment outcome in this project. For assessment of the saliva flow rate, whole saliva will be collected between 9 and 12 a.m. Subjects will refrained from eating, drinking, smoking and oral hygiene for 2 hr before the collection. After being seated upright in a chair, they relax for 5 min and are then instructed to make as few movements as possible, including swallowing, during the collection.\n\nBefore and after treatment unstimulated whole saliva will be collected using the spitting method [33] where participants spit their saliva into a collection container over a period of 15 minutes. The salivary flow rate (SFR) (ml / min) is determined as the increase in weight of the container divided by the collection time in minutes.\n\nAfter the collection of unstimulated saliva, the subjects are instructed to chew on 1 g of sterile paraffin wax. They will be asked to keep their mouths closed during chewing and to avoid swallowing. Every 60 sec they will be asked to spit into a new saliva collector before starting a new chewing period. This will be repeated for 5 min.\n\nTo assess treatment outcome of the submandibular glands, saliva is also collected directly from the floor of the mouth in an unstimulated and stimulated state. The unstimulated whole saliva flow rate of the submandibular glands will be assessed by the swab method with cotton rolls placed buccally in each maxillary molar region and under the tongue on the floor of the mouth. Immediately prior to the start of collection they will be asked to swallow, in case this is not possible saliva will be extracted by a pipette. Collection takes place during two subsequent periods of 3 min and, at the end of each period, the chin and lips will be wiped with a napkin. Saliva flow rates are determined by weight (1 g equals 1 ml of saliva) with rolls and napkins weighed before collection and reweighed after. The flow rates is calculated as the increment in weight during collection and expressed as millilitres per minute. Saliva from the cotton rolls will be extracted by centrifugation (1500g) and analyzed for its composition. This stimulated collection process will be performed afterwards with citrus-containing rolls to stimulate the submandibular glands maximally. From each of these collections of saliva, saliva will be aliquoted and stored at -800C.\n\nChemical analysis of saliva Whole saliva contains a large number of bacteria and epithelial cells, as well as gingival crevicular fluid. Therefore, whole saliva is normally not suited for the analysis of sensitive chemical parameters. For this purpose, the selectively collected saliva from individual glands is much better. As a result, the majority of analyzes can be performed from either the parotid and submandibular gland / sublingualis saliva. The following analyzes will be performed on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by ionic balance estimation [34], sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride [35], total protein and selected proteins [36] and amylase [37]. The purpose of the studies is to evaluate whether saliva will be normalized after treatment, and thus provide an estimate of the saliva dental and mucosal protective capacity before and after treatment.\n\nData collection and analysis Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report Form (CRF).\n\nThe study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring, audit and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines Authority or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA for the processing of personal data under the Danish Data Protection Act. Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet."

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment and can decrease their serum cholesterol to near normal levels (Bilheimer DW, N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1658-64). Shortage of donor organ is a major problem for OLT. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organ. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders (such as Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Fox IJ, et al. N Engl J Med 1998;338:1422-6), Factor VII deficiency (Dhawan A et al. Transplantation 2004:78:1812-4), Glycogen storage disease type Ia (Muraca M, et al. Lancet 2002;359:317-8), etc) by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. Although, in the in-vivo system there is a controversy that if stem cells transdifferentiate into hepatocytes or fusion of stem cells and hepatocytes occur, however, in the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented (Lee KD, et al. Hepatology 2004;40:1275-1284; & Banas A, et al. Hepatology. 2007;46:219-28). We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al.

                              "Severe critical illness is often complicated by Intensive Care Unit - Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW), which is clinically characterized by bilateral and symmetrical limb weakness and is related to a myopathy and/or axonal polyneuropathy. ICU-AW affects between 25% to 60% mechanically ventilated patients more than 7 days and is associated with increased in and post-ICU mortality, with delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation and with long-term functional disability. Most patients who develop an ICU-AW have been admitted for a sepsis episode and the main risk factors of ICU-AW include the severity of critical illness, immobilization, hyperglycemia and the use of some medications including steroids and neuromuscular agents, although this is somewhat controversial.\n\nThe pathophysiology of critical illness myopathy is thought to involve the following mechanisms: 1) impairment of muscular membrane excitability, secondary to an dysregulation of sodium channel gating, 2) mitochondrial dysfunction leading to bioenergetic failure and oxidative stress and 3) proteolysis, mainly related an activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These mechanisms can be triggered by various factors, notably systemic inflammatory mediators, endocrine dysfunction, immobilization, some drugs and electrolyte disturbances. The protracted functional consequences of ICU-AW indicate that muscle regeneration is also impaired. Surprisingly, muscle regeneration, which essentially depends on the muscle stem cells (also called satellite cells), has not been well investigated in the context of critical illness. The satellite cells (SC), that are located at the periphery of the muscle fiber, are activated in response to any muscle injury and then proliferate and differentiate to repair or replace the damaged fibers, but also self-renew to replenish the muscle stem cells reservoir.\n\nIt was recently demonstrated in a murine model of polymicrobial peritonitis that SC activation, proliferation and expression of myogenic markers were impaired after sepsis, leading to an impaired muscle regeneration, but that post-sepsis intramuscular administration of exogenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) could reverse this SC dysfunction. MSC treatment significantly improved the post-injury muscle recovery with decreasing necrosis and fibrosis but also increased the force of isolated single fibers.\n\nThe objectives of this translational research are to identify the mechanisms of Human SC dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis, to describe in vitro the effects of MSCs on this SC dysfunction, and to study hematopoietic cells and their damage in the blood and muscle consecutively to a sepsis, and their interaction with muscle stem cells."

However, recently, pathophysiological mechanisms of AMI reveal that begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense sterile inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes including neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI. Improved understanding in the interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling molecules within the injured myocardium have allowed development of novel experimental therapies. These therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit ischemic injury and prevent subsequent development of heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in particular, have emerged as potent paracrine modulators of inflammation that promote myocardial healing after infarction.\n\nThe latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. In mouse AMI models, we found MSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-\u03b2,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC possess s a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in AMI. In particular#safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and other studies in patients with AMI.\n\nGiven the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs can drive beneficial in therapy of AMI. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-infammatory mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly assigning 200 patients with AMI to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs, first time infusing within 24h after AMI or placebo , to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with acute ST-Segment-Elevation or Non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction."

Due to the lack of treatment in the KS, the aim is to develop a model of this disease from fibroblasts from patients and reprogram them into mesenchymal stem cells. This approach will generate a KS-specific stem cell bio-bank, allowing the identification of common disturbances caused by the loss of function (LoF) of KMT2D. The impact of the KMT2D LoF on transcription but also the epigenetic mechanisms activated during MSC differentiation will be described. Finally, the therapeutic potential of an epigenome \"editing\" approach to increase the expression of the wild KMT2D allele to restore the functional activity of MLL4 in treated MSCs will be evaluated.\n\nThe secondary objective is to evaluate the ability to return to normal after CRISPR/Case9 gene therapy treatment on patients' cells\n\nMethodology (design study, population, description of groups (if applicable), inclusion criteria, non-inclusion, main and secondary judgment criteria, number of subjects to be included, statistical analysis...) :\n\nStarting from primary cells isolated from affected patients, an in vitro model of the disease will be developed. An integrative but alternative strategy approach to obtain mesenchymal stem cells derived from patients to define normal and abnormal transcription and epigenetic circuits during KMT2D LoF will be adopted. By combining the autonomous renewal potential of MSCs with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an approach to \"editing\" the epigenome for therapeutic purposes to restore MLL4 activity will be developed.\n\nThis project will represent a step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for KS. The in vitro model will provide the scientific community with an experimental system to study KS. Finally, the aim is to define the molecular basis of KS and develop a therapeutic strategy to improve certain symptoms in patients with KS.\n\nProcess (number of visits, duration of inclusions, duration of follow-up):\n\n8 people will be included: 4 patients with Kabuki syndrome authenticated by the molecular genetics study of the KMT2D gene.\n\n4 parents of the same sex as the patient\n\nFeasibility :\n\nIn the clinical genetics department of the Montpellier University Hospital, more than 40 patients with Kabuki syndrome are followed.\n\nImpacts / prospects :\n\nThe identification of the consequences of mutations in the KMT2D gene on epigenetic mark changes and cellular structural changes as well as the attempt at gene correction by CRISPR/Cas9 will provide a better understanding of the disease (and the genes that are deregulated by post-KMT2D epigenetic changes) and will also open a promising path for gene therapy by CRISPR/Cas9 method."

Patients were recruited into three different dose groups, and 12 subjects were enrolled in each group. The subjects of each group will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, and 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg respectively. According to the principle of dose escalation, subjects preset to low-dose will receive the administration first. Each group will receive only one corresponding dose for safety and tolerability check. The subjects will be observed for 21 days after the initial dose due to limited proliferation or differentiation potential and relatively low immunogenicity of mesenchymal stem cell products. The safety measures will be discussed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether subjects who have received a single dose will proceed with subsequent injections. Once all subjects in the lower-dose group have completed the initial administration and observed for 21 days. The DSMB will decided whether to proceed with the next-dose group. All subjects will receive routine drug treatment during the study. Primary endpoint: incidence and severity of cell therapy related adverse events from the beginning of treatment to the end of the follow-up. Secondary end point of the study includes: the change in Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of the subjects from baseline, at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; the overall survival rate at the 12th month after the last administration; Changes in liver function compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; changes of child Pugh score compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; and the change of Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) score from baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration."

                              "Severe aplastic anemia is characterized by severe deficiencies in peripheral-blood platelets, white cells, and red cells. These defects in mature cells occur because aplastic bone marrow contains severely reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells. To date, Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants are routinely used to treat patients with many different diseases, including various cancers and blood disorders, such as aplastic anemia. The main sources of HSCs are bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood. However, challenges include obtaining enough functional HSCs to ensure optimal engraftment, and avoiding immune rejection and other complications associated with allogeneic transplantations. Novel abundant sources of clinical-grade HSCs are therefore being sought.\n\nOur novel studies have demonstrated that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted rapidly (in 4 days) into AD-HSCs on a large scale (2X108-9 cluster of differentiation 34\uff08CD34\uff09positive cells) by transfection of small RNAs to the the early region 1A (E1A)-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines. In vitro, AD-HSCs expanded efficiently and resembled cord-blood HSCs in phenotype, genotype, and colony-forming ability. In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. we show that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) can be converted into AD-HSCs by transfection of small RNAs to the E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in the presence of specific cytokines.

In a mouse model, primary and secondary transplantation analysis and repopulating assays showed that AD-HSCs homed to the bone marrow, differentiated into functional blood cells, and showed a long-term ability to self-renew. In the safety aspect, we saw no evidence of leukemia, teratoma and other cancers in the blood, testes and subcutaneous tissues of transplanted mice. More importantly, our preliminary data have shown that AD-HSCs can reconstitute hematopoietic function in five patients with severe aplastic anemia. Based on these premilitary studies,, we have determined to conduct a further clinical investigation in multiple medical centers. In this study we plan to enroll up to 90 patients, to make a comprehensive assessment for this new treatment regimen and to show it is equal or superior to the current immunosuppressive regimen. Patients will be in the study for one years for treatment and active monitoring. All patients will be followed until death."

                              "Allergic rhinitis (AR), is a noninfectious inflammatory disease of nasal mucosa mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody and involved in a variety of immune active cells and cytokines after the atopic body is exposed to allergens. The incidence of allergic rhinitis increases as people's living standards improves. It is estimated that about 1.4 billion people worldwide have been affected by the disease. Some patients with moderate to severe AR have no improvement in symptoms after drug treatment, which continues to affect daily life and work. Therefore, these patients urgently needs a new, minimally invasive, effective and simple treatment. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the mesoderm, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat and other cells. MSCs can also secrete a variety of bioactive molecules, which have the effects of regulating immunity and anti-inflammatory. Based on its immunomodulatory effect, MSCs is gradually becoming a new star in the treatment of allergic diseases. In pre-clinical studies on the treatment of AR, MSCs have shown good therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThis study is a prospective, open, single-center clinical study. Participants were recruited into three different dose groups. The cohort size of each dose group was 6 participants. The subjects of each group each will receive one course of treatment with a single injection. Subjects of group 1 will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 2 will receive 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg; with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 3 will receive 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs. One month after each injection, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will comprehensively evaluate the results of the phased clinical research, and after determining the safety and feasibility of the research, the enrollment of the next phase will start. The subjects will be followed up on the 3rd day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the treatment. The main outcome measures are the severity and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcome measures are RQLQ score, VAS score, serum inflammatory factor detection, nasal secretion inflammatory factor detection, nasal function test and nasal endoscopy, etc. In addition, the investigators will also monitor safety indicators such as blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, immunological indicators, tumor markers, etc. At the end of the study, according to the data obtained, the clinical safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of UCMSCs in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent AR will be evaluated, so as to provide drug dose basis for the next stage of clinical research."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many hematologic diseases. However, about 5-27% of patients would suffer from poor graft function (PGF) and more recipients might develop delayed platelet engraftment (DPE) after allo-HSCT. These complications are associated with considerable mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF and DPE usually involves hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or second transplantation, but these methods have dismal effect or even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs might be effective in the treatment of PGF.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF or DPE is unsatisfactory in our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF or DPE after allo-HSCT."

However, because salvaging the viable myocardium is dependent on early reperfusion, only a minority of participants will reach the hospital within the time-window for myocardial rescue. Thus, even if the participant manages their tobacco use, hypertension, lipid levels, diabetes, weight and exercise, many participants will go on to develop Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Though the medical management for CHF may improve symptoms and slow disease progression, such treatment cannot restore a functioning myocardium. A therapy that could improve the myocardial remodeling process and reduce the incidence or severity of CHF following acute MI would provide a significant benefit.

                              "Different types of stem cells have been used in various ways in several research projects to find the optimal procedure to regenerate the human corneal stroma. It included several approaches which can be classified as intrastromal implantation of stem cells (1) alone, (2) together with a biodegradable scaffold, (3) with a non-biodegradable scaffold, or (4) with a decellularized corneal stromal scaffold. The complex structure of the corneal stroma has not been yet replicated, and there are well-known drawbacks to the use of synthetic scaffold-based designs. Recently, several corneal decellularization techniques have been described, which provide an acellular corneal extracellular matrix (ECM). These scaffolds have gained attention in the last few years. The scaffold provides a more natural environment for the growth and differentiation of cells when compared with synthetic scaffolds. In addition, components of the ECM are generally conserved among species and are tolerated well even by xenogeneic recipients. Keratocytes are essential for remodeling the corneal stroma and for normal epithelial physiology. This highlights the importance of transplanting a cellular substitute together with the structural support (acellular ECM) to undertake these critical functions in corneal homeostasis. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, all attempts to repopulate decellularized corneal scaffolds have used corneal cells, but these cells have major drawbacks that preclude their autologous use in clinical practice (damage of the donor tissue, lack of cells, and inefficient cell subcultures), thus the efforts to find an extraocular source of autologous cells. A recent study by the investigators has shown a perfect bio integration of human decellularized corneal stromal laminas (100 \u00b5m thickness) with and without h-ADASCs colonization inside the rabbit cornea in vivo, without observing any rejection response despite the graft being xenogeneic. The investigators also demonstrated the differentiation of h-ADASCs into functional keratocytes inside these implants in vivo, which then achieved their proper biofunctionalization. According to the investigator's opinion, the transplant of stem cells together with decellularized corneal ECM would be the best technique to effectively restore the thickness of a diseased human cornea, like in keratoconus. Through this technique, and using extraocular mesenchymal stem cells from patients, it is possible to transform allergenic grafts into functional autologous grafts, theoretically avoiding the risk of rejection.\n\nThe process flow is defined as following: (1) the file study: which start by receiving the file of the patient, the file will be forwarded to appointed physicians coordinators for review and submission of medical report, then the medical report will be evaluated within the cell therapy committee and the patient will be asked for clinical examination, and after consultation a reply to the patient with medical decision will follow with an approval or not to be recruited and if yes, a brief report about the procedure will be submitted and explained in details to the patient, a consent form must be signed if the patient agree to be included in the study, (2) the patient admission: which may start by completion of the procedure forms and doing the pre-op evaluation (initial work up defined as a clinical and biological assessment upon C.A.S which may include unaided and best spectacle corrected visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, corneal topography, aberrometry, endothelial cell count (specular microscopy), corneal confocal microscopy, as well as blood tests), all this tests should be effectuated by an specialist and reviewed by an ophthalmologist. Then, a lipoaspiration of the subcutaneous adipose tissue to be performed by a plastic surgeon, sample processing at a cGMP facility for isolation and characterization of the stromal vascular fraction enriched with ADASCs as well as laminas preparing (the quality control assessment will be realized before and after all the steps of the procedure starting from the ADASCs collection to implantation including cell culture, cell quiescence, decellularization of human corneal lamina, recellularization of the laminas with ADASCs, and implantation; the assessment will include cell viability, cell number, cell apoptosis, immunophenotyping, infection, inflammation by analyzing the secreted cytokines from ADASCs, lamina cutting, lamina thickness, immunostaining, confocal microscopy, etc.); (3) the delivery (implantation) which starts by a peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia where the patient is placed under operating microscope, followed by a femtosecond laser-assisted mid-stromal lamellar dissection, then the autologous ADASCs or laminas or recellularized laminas will be placed within the pocket, and finally closed by a superior incision closure. The patient will be put under antibiotic/steroids for a defined period and followed by the team at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months.\n\nThis protocol of cell therapy will be applied exclusively at VISSUM (Alicante-Spain), Barraquer Ophthalmology Center (Barcelona-Spain), Ramon y Cajal Hospital (Madrid-Spain), Asturias Prince Hospital (Madrid-Spain), and Murcia Hospital (Murcia-Spain), in affiliation with Miguel Hernandez of Elche University (Elche-Spain).\n\nThe patient's recruitment will take place: for the lipoaspiration, processing, preparing the cellularized laminas and quality control assessments in VISSUM (Alicante-Spain), Barraquer Ophthalmology Center (Barcelona-Spain), Ramon y Cajal Hospital (Madrid-Spain), and Murcia Hospital (Murcia-Spain). All these steps are managed by VISSUM (Prof. J. ALIO)."

                              "Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.\n\nThe most popular form of autologous MSC therapy has been through the use of autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate (MSCs, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a \"healing\" effect on the environment in which it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\n\nAdipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of MSCs versus that in bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known as stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.\n\nAlthough the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and \"dose\" have not been performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized study arms with different types of MSCs (bone marrow derived MSC, adipose derived MSC, and umbilical cord tissue MSC) and then will be further randomized to receive an injection of the MSC type they were initially assigned to or corticosteroid. Participants randomized to bone marrow derived MSC or adipose derived MSC will undergo a procedure (bone marrow aspiration or liposuction). Participants will be blinded to whether they receive the MSC or corticosteroid injection."

                              "Stroke is the second leading cause of death behind ischemic heart disease worldwide. Traditional treatments have some limitations whereas preclinical data suggest that stem cell therapy is a promising regenerative medical treatment given the limited capacity of the central nervous system for self-repairs after ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that umbilical cord blood-derived Mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusion improves the outcomes of several neurological damage conditions, including stroke. These results encouraged us to initiate the phase I/II clinical trial aiming to evaluate the safety and the efficiency of UC-MSC transplantation in the treatment of patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke. This case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between 2021 and 2023. In this trial, 48 patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke will be enrolled into 3 groups: UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route group (16), UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal administration route group (16), and control group (16). The UC-MSC group (IV/intrathecal) will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x106 cells/kg patient body weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be measured using these scales including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-NIHSS, Functional Independence Measure -FIM, Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS, Fine motor skills-FMS, 36-Item Short Form Survey -SF-36. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months post-intervention."

Their initial skin status will be evaluated utilizing dermoscopy photoaging scale (DPAS) and Janus-3\u00ae skin analyzer, along with skin capacitance using the Corneometer\u00ae and transepidermal water loss using the Tewameter\u00ae, followed by daily priming with 0.05% retinoic acid for two consecutive weeks. At second and fourth week, the participants are subjected to microneedle and fractional CO\u2082 laser according to the respective protocol in split-face fashion, which the randomization will be determined by an independent operator. Succeeding the treatment, four-fold concentrated ADMSCs secretome will be administered topically to the both sides of face. The final skin condition will ultimately be recorded at the sixth week, along with their satisfaction and convenience degree, also the adverse events experienced during the trial. Appropriate statistical analyses will subsequently be performed at the significance level of 0.05."

                              "This is a prospective, multicenter (with two performance sites under the auspices of Case Western Reserve University Clinical and Translational Science Award (CWRU CTSA) at University Hospitals and at MetroHealth Medical Center), double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infusion in 20 new onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients with moderate to high disease activity despite adequate doses of methotrexate (MTX) for 12 weeks (at least 10 weeks of which has been at a dose of >/=15 mg per week). The study is a single dose, phase I clinical trial, and this is the first time that this product will be infused in RA patients. After a screening period, the baseline visit will be conducted. Patients will halt their concomitant MTX 3 days prior to the MSC infusion and may resume their methotrexate at Day 7 following MSC infusion based on their disease activity score. This is a dose escalation study of a total of 20 patients with three groups of five patients each and five placebo patients. Patients will be randomized to receive MSC or placebo infusion using a computer-generated randomization scheme that takes into account that there are two sites. The first cohort will consist of a total of six patients. Of these six patients, five patients each will receive a single infusion of 2 million/kg MSCs and one patient will receive placebo infusion. The second cohort will include a total of seven patients, of these seven patients; five patients will receive 4 million/kg MSCs and two patients who will receive placebo infusion. The final cohort consists of a total of seven patients. Of these seven patients, five patients will receive 6 million/kg allogeneic MSCs and two patients will receive placebo infusion. Infusion will occur on Day 0. Post-infusion study visits will occur on Days 1 (Visit 3), 7 (Visit 4), 14 (Visit 5), 28 (Visit 6), 56 (Visit 7), and weeks 24 (Visit 8), 39 (Visit 9) and 52 (Visit 10). Phone calls will occur on Day 4, 21, and 72. Subject safety and tolerability of the single dose of MSCs will be evaluated at these study visits by reviewing interval histories, administering patient questionnaires (legacy [Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID 3) / Short Form 36 (SF36)] and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive technology CAT), performing physical exams and spirometry, and obtaining safety laboratories. Special attention will be given to exacerbation of RA or \"flare\". This study will also explore the efficacy measures: Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) and American College of Rheumatology20/50/70 (ACR20/50/70 will be calculated. Since the primary hypothesis is that infusion of MSCs will induce a state of immune tolerance, various assays to detect post-infusion changes in cells subsets, function or protein biomarker will be repeated at Day 7 and/or 14 and compared to baseline values (with-in subject comparison). Biomarkers to look at cell-subsets will be drawn. Selected patient samples will be stored for exploratory studies using Mass Cytometry (Cytof 2). Lastly, for those subjects who are agreeable to undergo the procedure, a bone marrow aspiration will be performed prior to infusion with allogeneic MSCs. MSCs from RA bone marrow will be expanded, banked, and used for future translational studies."

                              "** Study settings : The study is to be held at Ain-Shams University Maternity Hospital - urogynecolgy unit; recruiting the patients from the urogynecology outpatient clinic\n\n** Sample size:\n\nFifty female patients with stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency will be recruited into two groups; group A including 25 patients will be injected with stem cells, & these will be the patients refusing surgery as a primary line of treatment, or unfit for surgery. Group B; including 25 patients, will undergo the tension-free vaginal tape operation. The sample size is determined according to the following equation:\n\n[ P1( 100-P1) + P2( 100-P2) ] / (P2 - P1)2 where; Power of the test = 80% Confidence level = 95% Alpha error = 5% Assuming success rate for the preferably used intervention \"tension-free vaginal tape\" in patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency P1=80% ( Schierlitz et al, 2008).\n\nAssuming success rate for stem cell therapy P2= 90% ( Smaldone et al, 2009).\n\n** Intervention:\n\nConsent Informed consent will be taken according to World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki; the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\nHistory Full medical history will be taken from each patient, together with detailed history as regards voiding habits, incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urinary infection. Questionnaire about incontinence, & questionnaire about quality of life will be obtained.\nExamination Complete physical and pelvic examination to evaluate the presence of stress urinary incontinence, & to exclude patients with marked hypermobility of the urethra, or severe cystocele or rectocele.\nUrodynamic study A multi-channel urodynamic study using Euet Sensik \u00ae will be performed including cystometry, urethral pressure measurement, abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) measurement, & residual urine measurement. Patients with stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency will be selected. Criteria for selection are: absence of involuntary contractions during leakage caused by a stress maneuver; low ALPP (<60 cmH2O); & maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) <20-30 cmH2O. Patients with voiding dysfunction will be excluded (residual urine volume >100ml).\n\nCells retrieval, culture, & processing:\n\n* Bone marrow aspiration:\n\n-Site: posterior superior iliac crest.\n\n-Procedure: The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with the top leg flexed and the lower leg straight. The iliac crest is palpated, and the preferred sampling site is marked with a pen. Aseptic technique is employed, including sterile gloves and gown. The site is prepared with an antiseptic (povidone-iodine), scrubbed, and draped, exposing only the site to be sampled. The skin and the underlying tissue to the periosteum are infiltrated with a local anaesthetic (approximately 10 mL of 1% Xylocaine [lidocaine]). A 10-mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle is used to inject an initial 0.5 mL directly under the skin, raising a wheal. A 22-gauge needle is used to penetrate deeper into the subcutaneous tissue and the underlying periosteum, an area roughly 1 cm in diameter. A skin incision is made with a small surgical blade, through which the bone marrow aspiration needle, with a stylet locked in place, is inserted. Once the needle contacts the bone, it is advanced by slowly rotating clockwise and counter clockwise until the cortical bone is penetrated and the marrow cavity is entered. The depth of the penetration should not extend beyond an initial 1cm. Once within the marrow cavity, the stylet is removed. Using a 20 mL syringe, approximately 5 mL of bone marrow are aspirated. Subsequent specimens are obtained by attaching a separate syringe, collecting 5 mL at a time. The samples are then transferred into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -containing tube. The marrow needle is removed, and pressure is applied to the aspiration site with gauze until any bleeding stops.\n\n* Cells processing & culture:\n\n- Mononuclear cells (MNCs) will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficol/Hypaque.\n\n- Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be isolated through plastic adherence by the seeding of MNCs in T25 tissue culture flasks in complete culture media (DMEM, 1% antibiotics/antifungal, 20% autologous serum). Flasks will be incubated at 37\u00baC in CO2 incubator for 3-5 days.\n\n- After 5 days, flasks will be evaluated under inverted microscope for the number and morphology of MSCs. Non-adherent cells will be discarded and medium replenished.\n\n- Half of the medium will be changed every 3 days.\n\n- Flasks will be evaluated until cells reach about 80-90% confluence.\n\nMSCs will be harvested using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 5 minutes. Afterwards, trypsin action will be stopped by the addition of autologous serum.\nMSCs will be washed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), counted, tested for viability using trypan blue exclusion test.\nMSC will be identified using immunophenotypic markers (positive for CD44 and negative for CD34).\nCells will be suspended in sterile saline, a minimum of 20 X 106 MSCs cells in a 10 cc syringe, ready for injection.\n\nQuality control check for the sterility by the performance of bacterial aerobic and anaerobic cultures will be done to ensure the complete aseptic conditions during the specimen retrieval, preparation, storage, and injection. (Gunetti et al., 2012)\n\nInjection of cells:\n\nThe patient will be placed in lithotomy position. A Foley's catheter (size 18) will be inserted in the urethra, then under local anaesthesia; retrieved cells (total 20- 30 million cells per patient in 10cc syringe) (Sebe et al., 2011) will be injected into the submucosal tissue at the level of the proximal urethra just distal to the bladder neck (guided by stretch on the Foley's catheter), at 3,9,12 o'clock, injecting around 3.5 cc in each site.\n\nTension-free vaginal tape (TVT):\n\nAnother 25 patients will undergo surgical intervention, which is the \"tension-free vaginal tape\" operation at the obstetrics & gynecology department - Ain Shams Maternity Hospital - urogynecology unit. In this technique, a small midurethral incision will be made in the vaginal mucosa, then a polypropylene 40*1cm mesh tape attached to two curved trocars will be passed lateral to the urethra & through the endopelvic fascia into the retropubic space. The trocar will then be passed along the back of the pubic bone, through the rectus fascia, in two small suprapubic skin incisions, then the tension on the tape adjusted & the remaining tape cut off at the level of the skin.\n\nFollow up:\n\nFollow up visits will be conducted at 3months, 6months, 9months, and 12months after therapy. Clinical examination, incontinence questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire, & urodynamic study will be done.\n\n** Data collection & recording:\n\nEach patient will have a case record form (CRF) in which the following data will be recorded:\n\nAge, parity\nBody mass index (BMI).\nType of intervention (stem cell therapy or TVT)\nInternational Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\nIncontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) Instrument Score on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\nCough test on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\n\nUrodynamic study on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nDescriptive statistics for measured variables will be expressed as range, mean and standard deviation (for metric data); range, median and interquartile range (for discrete data); and number and proportions (for categorical data). Pre-injection & post-injection findings will be compared using the t-test or the Wilcoxon test depending on whether the measured parameters were Gaussian variables. A P-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant.\n\n** Ethical considerations:\n\nDelegation of investigator responsibilities:\n\nThe investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately informed about the protocol, & their trial-related duties and functions. The investigator will maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified person to whom he or she has delegated significant trial-related duties.\n\nPatient information and informed consent Before being admitted to the clinical study, the patient must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to her. An informed consent document, in Arabic language, contains all locally required elements and specifies who informed the patient. After reading the informed consent document, the patient must give consent in writing. The patient's consent must be confirmed at the time of consent by the personally dated signature of the patient and by the personally dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. If the patient is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written informed consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence of an impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by the personally dated signature of the patient or by a local legally recognized alternative (e.g., the patient's thumbprint or mark). The witness and the person conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the consent document. The original signed consent document will be retained by the investigator. The investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.\nConfidentiality Only the patient number and patient initials will be recorded in the CRF, and if the patients name appears on any other document, it must be kept in privacy by the investigators. The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be identified.\nProtocol approval Before the beginning of the study and in accordance with the local regulation followed, the protocol and all corresponding documents will be declared for ethical and research approval by the council of ob/gyn department, Ain Shams University; according to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki."

                              "Low back pain (LBP) is the global leading cause of disability, and furthermore rates sixth in terms of overall disease burden, in both developed and developing countries. LPB is a condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age, and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP will increase substantially over coming years.\n\nCurrent LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment. Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.\n\nIn a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby causing biomechanical functional failure.\n\nToday, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this common and debilitating disease.\n\nThe objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years."

                              "This prospective, open-label clinical phase-3 study was conducted at Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology between April 2019 and April 2021. Thirty-six eyes of 18 patients with toxic optic neuropathy were included in the study. The primary toxic optic neuropathy (TON) diagnosis was made in emergency or intensive care clinics. Patients who admitted within 3 months after the first intervention were included in the study. All patients enrolled underwent a complete routine ophthalmic examination, including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement with the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart (Topcon CC 100 XP, Japan). The patients were further evaluated with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) from RTVue XR (Avanti, Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) to analyse and measure the changes in the ganglion cell complex (GCC) layer that provided a typical co-registered en-face and cross-sectional multimodal imaging platform. Functional evaluation of optic nerve was followed by Compass 24/2 visual field (VF) test (Compass, CenterVue, Padova, Italy) and 120' pattern visual evoked potential (pVEP) test (Mon 2018F, Metrovision, Perenchies, France).\n\nSubjects Thirty-six eyes of 18 TON patients were included in the study.\n\nInclusion criteria consisted of several parameters:\n\nCases poisoned with a toxic agent within 3 months\nPatients with BCVA better than 35 letters\nAny degree of visual field loss\nPatients over 18 years old\n\nExclusion criteria consisted of several parameters:\n\nCases poisoned with a toxic agent more than 3 months\nPatients with BCVA less than 35 letters: to perform the visual field test correctly\nNeurological sequelae that cannot be cooperated\nSmoking\n\nThe same treatment protocol was applied to all patients with methanol intoxication before admission to our clinic. Hemodialysis, bicarbonate and ethanol were administered to all patients. The cases were divided into 3 groups according to similar demographic characteristics.\n\nGroup 1: Consists of 12 eyes of 12 patients treated with WJ-MSC and rEMS combination in one eye. WJ-MSC was applied only one time before rEMS applications. rEMS application was started 10 days after WJ-MSC application.The rEMS was applied with a custom-designed helmet for 30 minutes after the WJ-MSC application. rEMS applications were repeated 10 times with a 1-week interval. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.\n\nGroup 2: Consists of 12 eyes of 12 patients treated with only rEMS in one eye. The rEMS was applied with a custom-designed helmet for 30 minutes. rEMS applications were repeated 10 times with a 1-week interval. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.\n\nGroup 3: Consists of 12 eyes of 6 patients treated with only WJ-MSC in two eyes. WJ-MSC was applied only one time for both eyes. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.\n\nUmbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells preparation The mesenchymal stem cells used in this study were isolated from Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord that was collected allogenicly from a single donor with the mother's consent. The umbilical cord sample was treated following several steps. Briefly, cord tissue was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Lonza, Switzerland) and the Wharton's jelly part was minced using forceps and a scalpel. Minced pieces were cultivated in a cell culture dish (Greiner Bio-One, Germany) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (DMEM)-low glucose with no L-glutamine (Bilogical Industries, Israel) and 10% human AB serum (Capricorn, Germany), 1% 10.000 U/mL penicillin, and 10.000 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Gibco,USA). All cell preparations and cultivation procedures were conducted in a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) accredited laboratory (Onkim Stem Cell Technologies, Turkey). The culture-expanded cells were cryopreserved at P3 using standard cryopreservation protocols until used in the following experiment. CryoSure-DEX40 (WAK-Chemie Medical, Germany) containing 55% Dimethyl Sulfoxide and 5% Dextran 40 was used as cryopreservant. The cells were characterized at the time of cryopreservation using flow cytometric analysis to determine the expression of the positive cluster of differentiation (CD) surface markers, CD90, CD105, CD73, CD44, CD29, and negative for CD34, CD45, and CD11b. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the expressions of several genes, such as tumor necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) and vimentin (VIM) were analyzed. Additionally, quality control analyses, such as mycoplasma and endotoxin analyses (using the PCR and LAL test combined with sterility analysis, respectively) were also completed. Cells were solubilized from cryopreservation before being prepared for injection. Average cell viability for each treatment was over 90.0%, and each patient received 2-6 x 106 cells in a 1.5 ml saline solution.\n\nInjection of umbilical cord WJ-MSCs The WJ-MSCs suspension from the culture was delivered to the operating room by cold chain and used within 24 hours. A total of 1.5 ml of the WJ-MSC suspension was immediately injected into the subtenon space of each eye. The procedure was conducted under topical anesthesia with proparacaine hydrochloride drops (Alcaine, Alcon, USA) and sterile conditions. 5/0 atraumatic traction suture was applied to the limbus for easy access and manuplation to application area. Postoperatively, loteprednol and tobramycin combination eye drops were given four times per day for one week, and oral amoxicillin clavulonate (1 gr) was given twice a day for five days\n\nRetinal repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rEMS) The rEMS helmet (MagnovisionTM, Bioretina Biotechnology, Ankara, Turkey) stimulated the retina and visual pathways with an electromagnetic field strength of 2000 miligauss, frequency of 42 hertz, and duration 30 minutes. These values were previously determined to be effective for other clinical and preclinical studies.\n\nTimeframe\n\nThe patients were evaluated at several study timepoints:\n\nT0 (baseline): immediately before the applications\nT1: 1rst month of applications\nT2: 3rd month of applications\n\nPrimary outcome measure \u2022 ETDRS visual acuity: The visual acuity scores obtained from the T0 and T2 examinations were analyzed and compared using statistical tests to determine effectiveness.\n\nSecondary outcome measures\n\n\u2022 Visual field sensitivity: Fundus perimetry deviation index (FPDI, %) FPDI was examined in the 24/2 visual field of the computerized perimetry records. The FPDI offers data explaining how many of the 100 flashing points and what percentage of the visual field could be correctly seen by the patient. For VF analysis, in order to avoid mistakes during the test, practice rounds were carried out three times before applications.\n\n\u2022 Ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC thickness, \u00b5m): GCC is the thickness from the internal limiting membrane to the inner plexiform layer in the 3x3 mm of foveal area. The measurement done automatically by the OCTA device. GCC is the total thickness of the ganglion cells and retinal nerve fibers.\n\n\u2022 Pattern visual evoked potential (pVEP) pVEP is a objective test that measures the electrical activity of the optical pathway in response to a light stimulus. The 120' patterns reveals responses from the all retinal quadrants. The measurements were taken according to the ISCEV standarts for both eyes. We used the 120'pattern VEP protocol, which combines p100 implicit time and amplitude, to create a numerical result."

At this stage of the disease, perhaps a multi-faceted approach to halt the toxicity of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and promote cell survival and/or replace lost cells would be most beneficial.Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical drug which can improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are being clinically explored as a new therapeutic for treating a variety of immune-mediated diseases.Preclinical studies of the mechanism of action suggest that the therapeutic effects afforded by MSC transplantation are short-lived and related to dynamic, paracrine interactions between MSCs and host cells.Clinical trials of MSCs thus far have shown no adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous MSC transplants. Clinical studies showed that umbilical cord derived MSC is immunologically stable and not toxic.\n\nThis study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC (Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell).This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease."

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

The allogeneic IMP allo-APZ2-ACLF contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.\n\nThe clinical trial will be conducted in Germany and will consist of a screening, treatment and efficacy follow-up period, and a safety follow-up period.The total duration is planned to be about 3 years including the follow-up period.\n\nThe planned sample size is up to 18 treated patients. 2 x 10e6 cells/kg, each at Day 0, Day 5 (\u00b11) and Day 13 (\u00b11), will be administrated into peripheral vein (arm) by use of a perfusor. allo-APZ2-ACLF will be in a concentration of 1 x 10e7 cells/mL in HRG-solution. In patients which require dialysis, the IMP application has to be performed at least 3 hours after end of dialysis. This is necessary to ensure that cells and secreted molecules are not cleared from the system by the dialysis.\n\nPatients will be followed up for 24 weeks with clinic visits at Weeks 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 after IMP application. Further safety follow-ups will be scheduled as home interviews via telephone at Months 15 and 24. If necessary (at the discretion of the investigator), safety follow-ups at Months 15 and 24 can also be carried out as an on-site visit.\n\nThe first six patients will be enrolled into the clinical trial consecutively with an interval of 2 weeks between the third IMP-application of the first patient and the enrolment of the second patient, etc. During this period the patient receives all three applications and immediate severe adverse effects (allergic reactions, SIRS) that could occur after treatment would be reported before treatment start of the next patient.\n\nThe safety data of these first six patients will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor continuously, if required with assistance of the further members of the DSMB. The safety evaluation of the DSMB will be submitted to the PEI and recruitment can only be continued after approval of an amendment."

Currently, the standard treatment for ischemic stroke is an intravenous tissue plasminogen activator(tPA; alteplase) and/or endovascular thrombectomy. However, the therapeutic time window for these treatments is narrow. Besides, endovascular thrombectomy requires specialized stroke expertise and endovascular skills. Less than 5% of ischemic stroke patients are treated by these therapy and not all patients achieve good outcomes. There is still a lack of therapy for the reduction disability from stroke. In 2018, at least 40 clinical trials intent to treat ischemic stroke using cell therapy. In particular, MSCs have shown great potential in the reduction disability from acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

                              "Articular cartilage injuries in the knee continue to grow in number as detection and treatment options have advanced. Treatment options, including microfracture, autologous chondrocyte (cells that make cartilage) implantation, osteochondral grafting and meniscus transplantation can hopefully deter the progression of degeneration and have promise to function as disease modifying solutions. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) has emerged as a preferred method of treating large focal chondral defects as it structurally replaces the cartilage and often involved sub-chondral bone with native hyaline cartilage and bone. The results of OCA are successful with greater than 85% survival at 5-year follow-up. Failure can occur due to a lack of boney integration or low chondrocyte viability. Therefore, anything to enhance the graft augmentation process may be useful in preventing failure. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study is to determine the effect of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) containing bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on improving graft incorporation and preventing failure. The effect of BMAC on the graft and intra-articular knee environment will be evaluated using 3 techniques: computed tomography (CT) imaging, synovial fluid cytokine analysis, and serum biomarker analysis. Information learned from this study can be used to biochemically compare treatment response and to assess emerging therapeutic options that may positively alter the biochemical environment in patients undergoing osteochondral allograft transplantation."

                              "Although HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency, a chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. In particular, this immune activation has been identified as a disease determinant independent of viral load or cell death in HIV-1 infection. A series of clinical evidences have indicated that activated CD8 T cells may attack body cells infected with viruses. Because of this, CD4 cells infected with HIV are frequently destroyed by CD8 cells.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the adult stem cells originating from the mesenchymal and connective tissue of bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord, cord blood, peripheral blood, liver, etc. These cells show immunomodulation, self-renewal, and multi-directional differentiation potential. In particular, MSCs have recently emerged as promising candidates for cell-based immunotherapy because they can modulate the immune response in various ways. A series of studies have indicated that secretion of dissoluble cytokines and direct contact with MSCs can block the development and functioning of antigen-presenting cells, inhibit the differentiation of B cells, and suppress the immune response of T cells and natural killer cells. The immunosuppressive effect of infused MSCs has been successfully employed in the treatment of acute severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, MSC may reduce inflammatory responses and promote tissue recovery in human diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn what dose of transfused MSC reduces the level of activation of CD8 cells in people infected with HIV. The decreased activation of CD8 cells may lead to a more CD4 T cell restoration in HIV infection. This study will also look at what dose of MSCs is tolerated and its safety in HIV- infected patients.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms:\n\nArm A:Participants will receive 48 weeks of low dose of MSC treatment followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nArm B:Participants will receive 48 weeks of high dose of MSC treatment followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nArm C: Participants will receive 48 weeks of saline placebo followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nStudy treatment will be given at 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 week since the onset of treatment. There will be an additional 48 weeks of follow-up for purposes of safety. After treatment has started, participants will be asked to come to the clinic on Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48,60,72,84 and 96. At each visit participants will receive enough study treatment to last until the next visit. Each visit will last between 2 and 3 hours. At most visits participants will have a physical exam, answer questions about any medications they are taking and how they are feeling, and have blood drawn for safety to assess CD4/CD8 cell counts and viral load. Some additional blood will also be stored for immunology testing. At some visits participants will be asked questions about their medication and medical history, have pupils dilated, have a hearing test, and have an electrocardiogram (EKG). Some visits will require participants to arrive fasting. Pregnancy tests may also be conducted if the participant is able to become pregnant or if pregnancy is suspected."

                              "The majority of Covid-19 cases either are asymptomatic or result in only mild disease. However, in a substantial percentage of patients, a respiratory illness requiring hospital care develops, and such infections can progress to critical illness with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support (Zhou 2020) , (Chen 2020) , (Cao 2020) , (Ruan 2020) . Among patients with Covid-19 who have been admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom, the case fatality rate has been approximately 26%, a percentage that has increased to more than 37% among patients who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation.(Docherty 2020) Although remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time until recovery in hospitalized patients, (Beigel 2020). Efforts to modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death have shown promising results.\n\nINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT The NK1R+ MSC cell therapy are allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells that will be delivered intravenously.\n\nDetails on cell culture and expansion of the cells are provided in the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls Section of the IND.\n\nCells are provided cryopreserved and are thawed, washed, and prepared for IV delivery.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and the optimal cell dose of the NK1R+ hMSC in patients recovering from ARDS.\n\n."

Baseline data will include physical examination of the knee, clinical assessment of knee pain and function using validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), radiographs, and MRI. Tissue from qualified donors will be used to establish allogeneic MSC banks (using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) based on standard operating procedures), which will be tested and released for clinical use. Patients will undergo surgical debridement of their cartilage defect with harvest of the articular cartilage surrounding the defect rim. Following rapid digestion into chondrocytes and their pericellular matrix, autologous chondrons will be mixed in a 1:4 ratio with allogeneic AMSCs obtained from AMSC banks and suspended in fibrin glue for application to the debrided osteochondral defect. All patients will be clinically evaluated at 1-2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, 18 moths, and 24 months post-RECLAIM for adverse events (AEs).

Stem cells are a kind of pluripotent cells with the ability of self replication. The self-renewal and differentiation characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, as well as cytokine secretion effect and immune characteristics, provide the possibility for mesenchymal stem cells to treat ischemic stroke. After the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells, the secretion of soluble media including growth factors and cytokines may be the main mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of intravenous injection of ischemia tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic stroke. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ischemic tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ischemic stroke patients with neurological dysfunction."

Sometimes the risk of surgery is comparable to the likelihood of fracture without treatment. In orthopedic surgery, bone chips , various types of ceramics, natural and synthetized bone mineral hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate, as well as numerous polymers and co-polymers of alfa-hydroxy acids are used to perform as an osteoconductive and rarely osteoinductive factor to help bone formation.Some evidence demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells deposited on the surface of this constructs enhance its osteogenic differentiation. In this study the investigators seeds cultured bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on bone matrix, to evaluate its therapeutic potential in repairing unicameral or aneurysmal bone cyst.This composite is placed in the bone cyst after its curettage during a surgery.Post-operation assessment is done by X-Ray examination and MRI at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months after treatment."

                              "Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is generally considered a non-medically manageable cause of male infertility. These patients, who constitute up to 10% of all infertile men, have abnormal spermatogenesis as the cause of their azoospermia. The etiology affecting approximately 60% of azoospermic men, includes non-obstructive causes of azoospermia, including toxic exposures or abnormal testicular development. NOA results from either primary testicular failure (elevated Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), small testes affecting up to 10% of men presenting with infertility), secondary testicular failure (congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with decreased LH and FSH, small testes), or incomplete or ambiguous testicular failure (either increased FSH and normal volume testes, normal FSH and small testes, or normal FSH and normal testis volume). Prior to microsurgical testicular sperm retrieval techniques and IVF/ICSI, donor insemination was the only option available to men with NOA. The establishment of in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a standard treatment modality has resulted in a number of these men successfully fathering a child through surgically retrieved sperm from the testis. The challenge, however, is to improve their spermatogenic function to enable the appearance of sperm in their ejaculate or to improve the chances of a successful retrieval from the testis for ICSI.\n\nThe initial evaluation aims at resolving the following issues: (1) confirming azoospermia, (2) differentiating obstructive from non-obstructive etiology, (3) assessing for the presence of reversible factors and (4) evaluating for the presence of genetic abnormalities. An elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level or an absence of normal spermatogenesis by testicular histology in the presence of azoospermia is generally considered sufficient evidence of a non-obstructive etiology. The most common reversible factors that need to be ruled out include recent exogenous hormone administration, severe febrile illnesses, chemotherapy/radiation or prolonged antibiotic use.\n\nDuring past few years a considerable progress in the derivation of male germ cells from pluripotent stem cells has been made. These studies provide a desirable experimental model for elucidating underlying molecular mechanism of male germ cell development and potential strategies for producing haploid germ cells for the treatment of male infertility. Spermatogenesis is a complex process by which spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) self-renew and differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. In mammals, this process takes place in the seminiferous tubules of testis, which provide a functional niche for male germ cells and involve three major stages: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Errors at any stage of spermatogenesis can result in subfertility and infertility.\n\nResearchers are currently developing alternative treatment options for these men involving stem cells. It has been verified that mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can form functional spermatozoa. Functional assays have shown that spermatozoa generated from iPSCs were capable of fertilizing the oocytes after intracytoplasmatic injection and giving rise to fertile offspring following embryo transfer. So far, functional male gametes from human iPSCs have not been obtained.\n\nThere are two possible approaches in generating of male germ cells from pluripotent stem cells: in vitro differentiation into advanced, haploid cell products or combined in vitro differentiation and in vivo transplantation. However, the originality of this study is illustrated in the transplantation of purified autologous CD34+/CD133+ and mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) into infertile patients without in vitro breeding, culture, or manipulation thus avoiding in vitro cell propagation risks as genetic mutations and DNA changes. The cells are withdrawn and injected back into the patient on the very same day of the procedure, hence conferring the highest safety and efficacy parameters."

                              "Duchenne muscular dystrophy(DMD) is the most commonly inherited pediatric muscular disorder. It is an X-linked genetic progressive and degenerative myopathy characterized by progressive weakness, which can lead to loss of motor functions in puberty as well as cardiac,respiratory involvement and premature death. The disease is one of a group of myopathies that differ depending on the degree of severity and the affected muscle types. It occurs at a rate of approximately 1:3500 male births and arises due to spontaneous mutations in the Dystrophin gene (locus Xp21.2); 65% of causative mutations are intragenic deletions, 6-10% are intragenic duplications and 30-35% are point mutations (along with other sequence variations). The disease is caused by a deficiency of Dystrophin or the synthesis of functionally impotent Dystrophin, a critical protein component of the Dystrophin glycoprotein complex acting as a link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in skeletal and cardiac muscles. A consequence of Dystrophin glycoprotein complex inefficiency is muscle fragility, contraction-induced damage, necrosis and inflammation.\n\nGlucocorticoid can prolong ambulation by 2 to 3 years, reduce scoliosis, and temper pulmonary and cardiac decline in the second decade of life. However, glucocorticoids causes well-known side effects, which are intolerable in more than 25% of patients. Thus, a disease-specific treatment is a major unmet need. Investigators have proposed various possibilities for the beneficial effects of corticosteroid based mainly on observations in mouse models of muscular dystrophy and on a limited number of studies in patients.\n\nThese possibilities include\n\nReducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes\nIncreasing Laminin expression and myogenic repair\nRetarding muscle apoptosis and cellular infiltration\nEnhancing Dystrophin expression\nAffecting neuromuscular transmission\n\nSome patients with Duchenne Myopathy treated early with steroids appear to have an improved long-term prognosis in muscle, myocardial outcome, and can help keep patients ambulatory for more years than expected without treatment. One protocol gives prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) for the 1st 10 days of each month to avoid chronic complications. Deflazacort, administered as 0.9 mg/kg/day, may be more effective than prednisone. The American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society recommend administering corticosteroids during the ambulatory stage of the disease.Published recommendations suggest starting therapy between 2 and 5 years of age in boys whose strength has plateaued or is declining, but earlier treatment may be more beneficial.\n\nSkeletal muscle has a great capacity to regenerate following muscle wasting caused by trauma or disease.This regenerative potential is attributed primarily to skeletal-muscle resident stem cells called satellite cells. In Duchenne Myopathy, satellite cells are exhausted following many rounds of muscle degeneration and regeneration. Hence, satellite cells and their progeny (myoblasts) have been considered as a promising candidate for cell replacement therapy for DMD and other types of muscle disease. Small quantities of adult stem cells exist in most tissues throughout the body where they remain quiescent for long periods of time prior to being activated in response to disease or tissue injury. Adult stem cells can be isolated from cells of the hematopoietic, neural, dermal, muscle and hepatic systems. Adult stem cells give rise to cell types of the tissue from which they originated, but according to scientific reports, they can differentiate into lineages other than their tissue of origin, e.g. transplanted bone marrow or enriched hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were reported to give rise to cells of the mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm.\n\nTwo main types of stem cells usually derived from adult bone marrow are HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). They can sometimes be obtained from fat, skin, periosteum, synovial membrane and muscle as well. MSCs are multipotent and capable of differentiating into several connective tissue types including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes and myoblasts. They can also impose an additional anti-inflammatory and paracrine effect on differentiation and tissue regeneration via cytokine pathways and have anti-apoptotic features. These genetically determined pluripotent cells may be easily isolated from bone marrow because they have membrane proteins (marker called cluster of differentiation (CD34 +) and specific marker STRO-I). Compared with pluripotent embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cell have a greater biosafety profile and lower risk of tumorigenicity, and perhaps that is why numerous -mesenchymal stem cell based therapies have made it to the clinical trial stage. Stem cell based therapies for the treatment of Duchenne Myopathy can proceed via two strategies.\n\nThe first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with Duchenne Myopathy that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient.\n\nIntramuscular route of administration can be considered most appropriate as muscular dystrophy is primarily a muscle disease. The cells can be injected in several points in the muscle alternatively they can be injected in the motor point of the muscle. A motor point is the point at which the motor branch of the innervating nerve enters the muscle. It is the point with the highest concentration of motor endplates and myoneural synapses. Due to high numbers of neuromuscular junctions at this point, a muscle contraction can be easily elicited using minimal electric stimulus. Motor points can therefore be identified as superficial points directly over the points on the muscles with help of external electrical stimulation. Limitation of this method is that only superficial muscles can be stimulated using this method.\n\nIn an open study, Sharma and colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of autologous bone marrow mononuclear transplantation by intramuscularly to patients with Duchenne Myopathy, Becker muscular dystrophy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. However, they did not provide the molecular diagnosis of these dystrophies. No significant adverse events were noted. An increase in trunk muscle strength was seen in 53% of the cases, 48% showed an increase in upper limb strength, 59% showed an increase in lower limb strength and approximately 10% showed improved gait. Eighty seven percent of 150 patients had functional improvement upon physical examination and electromyogram studies after 12 month."

                              "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths.\n\nStem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction.\n\nThe hMSCs are able to:\n\nPrevent reperfusion injury;\nPrevent excessive fibrosis;\nReestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.\nReestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis;\nPreserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration);\nPrevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis;\nLimit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity."

                              "Since late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic, more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48 patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other 24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment."

                              "STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.\n\nEligible subjects will undergo a one-month observation period to confirm that the targeted wound is chronic (only single wounds with evidence of less than 20% closure over that period will be eligible for treatment). Once this has been established, up to 6 administrations of BM-MSC EVs will occur, at each to be given over a period of no more than 3 months. A maximum of 50 cm2 in total wound surface will be treated, and each administration will occur 14 days (+/- 7 days) but no less than 7 days apart. If the wound closes prior to 6 administrations, no additional doses will be given. Wound closure will be determined by complete re-epithelialization that is not subject to re-injury during dressing changes or as a result of normal daily activities (e.g. wearing clothing, eating, sleeping). After the 6 doses of BM-MSC EVs are given, the wound will be followed monthly for a period of 4 months to the termination of the study at 8 months or, in the event the wound closes before receiving all 6 doses, for 4 month after the wound closes. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarTM will be used to measure the target lesion at all visits.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the safety of applying single administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month\n\nSecondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine the safety of applying multiple administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month and to determine if there is clinical benefit (>50% closure) of applying BM-MSC EVs to DEB wounds\n\nPLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: 10 subjects will be treated on the protocol with AGLE-102."

                              "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes. It is a persistent and refractory disease. There is currently a lack of effective clinical treatments for DN. The basic pathological processes of DN are renal tissue cell damage, apoptosis and continuous increase of inflammatory cytokines induced by early high glucose, which gradually leads to glomerular sclerosis and renal fibrosis.\n\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), as the \"youngest\" adult stem cells, have powerful anti-inflammatory functions, stronger differentiation potential, and good safety. They are ideal seed cells for the treatment of DN. At present, studies on a variety of animal models of DN have shown that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can delay the progression of DN and have a certain repair effect on damaged kidney tissue and renal function. Our previous preclinical study showed that UC-MSCs effectively improved the renal function, inhibited inflammation and fibrosis, and prevented its progression in a rat model of diabetes-induced chronic renal injury. Some autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been carried out abroad treatment of chronic kidney disease caused by various reasons, including clinical trials of DN, phase I/II test results did not show obvious adverse reactions related to stem cell therapy, and can improve the patient's renal function and quality of life to a certain extent.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating DN patients. This trial will recruit 38 patients. 19 patients received the treatment of conventional treatment + equal volume normal saline containing 1% human albumin (placebo group) were used as control group; conventional treatment + 1*10E6 UC-MSCs/kg body weight (experimental group) for intravenous infusion (once a week, 3 times in total) to treat 19 patients with DN (by unified standard inclusion), and subjects will be followed a total of 48 weeks from time of initial cell treatment."

                              "Periodontal regeneration involves the formation of alveolar bone, cementum and a new functional periodontal ligament. Over the recent years the concept of periodontal treatment has focused towards regeneration with a goal of regaining natural periodontal apparatus. Numerous procedures have been investigated in the past to try to promote periodontal regeneration which range from root biomodifications, soft tissue grafts, bone replacement grafts, guided tissue regeneration to the use of combinations of the same. However the success of these approaches are highly variable. As a consequence current research trends are inclined towards the principle of 'biological solutions for biological problem' and thus attempts are directed towards various approaches like tissue engineering, ERT (endogenous regenerative technology), application of biologics, cell based techniques, biomimetic nanoscaffold fabrication and others for periodontal regeneration. Of all known Polypeptide Growth Factors, Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Transforming Growth Factor \u03b2 (TGF \u03b2) which are abundant in \u03b1 granule of platelets are shown to exert a favourable effect on periodontal regeneration. Therefore use of platelet concentrates is a convenient approach to obtain autologous growth factors.\n\nPlatelet rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is an autologous concentrated platelet-rich thrombin free fibrin matrix, prepared by two step centrifugation of blood. Platelets isolated, remain intact and retain their growth factor compliment. This allows a more effective, sustained release of growth factors to the wound site following PRFM application. During the second spin, a cross-linking of fibrin takes place, resulting in the formation of a dense fibrin matrix, within which a concentration of viable platelets can be found. Having an organized fibrin matrix at the start of healing accelerates the speed of vascular ingress into the wound compared to non-accelerated healing, which requires a longer time for fibrin formation and the development of vascularity. The earlier the vascularity is established, faster is the migration of the bone-forming cells at the wound site and initiation of bone formation. Therapeutic applications of platelet-rich products have led to improved bone regeneration.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a multipotent stromal cells with prominent regenerative functions. MSCs were first identified and isolated from bone marrow and then found in various tissues including umbilical cord, adipose tissue and peripheral blood. Among these sources peripheral blood MSCs draw increasing attention as they share similar biological characteristics with MSCs derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells(BMMSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts, tenocytes, and myoblasts, which are considered as a cell source for various tissue repair and regenerating bone defects. The requirements of aspiration of bone marrow from the patient will cause pain and morbidity of the donor sites. It will be very convenient if peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) could be harvested and expanded to enough numbers, with their osteogenic capacity maintained in a clinical permitted period.\n\nHence, utilizing the osteogenic properties of both platelet rich fibrin matrix and peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration would be novel and may be advantageous than using Platelet rich fibrin matrix alone. The literature search does not show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new material i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the addition of a patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this seems to be an additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human mandibular periodontal intraosseous defects."

Prevalence is estimated to be 8-16% worldwide. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease and usually means that the patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT), which may involve a kidney transplant or a form of dialysis. One of the options in RRT is continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD is characterized by a continuous removal of extracellular fluid by peritoneal membrane. It should be noted that like any other peritoneal dialysis therapy, CAPD has Short or long-term complications and UFF is the most common functional disorder in which the peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damaged.\n\nThis project intends to evaluate, the role of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients who have ultrafiltration failure up to 6 months.\n\nIn this study, 10 male and female subjects who are on peritoneal dialysis for at least two years and have ultrafiltration failure with age range of 18 to 70 years will be enrolled. Patients will be selected from peritoneal dialysis patients attending the peritoneal dialysis ward of Dr. Shariati hospital. The main inclusion criteria is to be on peritoneal dialysis for at least last two years and having Ultrafiltration failure. After obtaining the consent form, a sample of fat tissue will be obtained by a general surgeon under sterilized condition from patients and then in the specialized lab, the mesenchymal stem cells will be separated and cultured to reach appropriate numbers (106/kg). The cells will be injected through peripheral vein in hospital setting. Patients will be followed-up (clinically and laboratory) at baseline and at week 3, week 6, month 3, month 4 and month 6. The clinical assessment and peritoneal function tests will be performed in each visit.

Briefly, human umbilical cord tissues along with informed consent forms will be collected from COVID-19- and hepatitis B, C virus-negative women with healthy pregnancies during the Cesarean Section surgery after completion of gestation period. The umbilical cord tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing penicillin and streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with 4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15ml PBS. The cord will then gently scrap with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced pieces will be incubated in 17.5ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50ml conical tube for ~3 hrs in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37oC. After ~3 hrs, the digested lysate will be passed through strainer and will be diluted three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two T-25cm2 flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37o C. The flasks will be fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic solution) every third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will be transferred in two T-75cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UMSCs at P3 will be characterized using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be employed for injection in RP patients."

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only drug approved specifically for the treatment of PBC. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into biliary epithelial cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in PBC patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus UDCA. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus UDCA. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 4,8,12,24,36 and 48. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase(ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time(PT), albumin(ALB), prealbumin(PA), are detected at these time points. Mayo risk score, portal hypertension, Liver histology, MELD score and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "The current study is a multi-center, double arm, adjuvant, randomized control trial (RCT), double-blind clinical trial, to analyze the differences in the usefulness and safety of Exosome-MSC intravenous injection therapy in moderate-grade COVID-19 patients with hyper-inflammation (Evans S.R, 2010).\n\nThis study used 2 groups (double arm) of study participants:\n\nTreatment Group (Intervention Arm): received treatment in the form of standard therapy and injection of Exosomes-MSC.\n\nControl Group (Control Arm): received treatment in the form of standard therapy and injection placebo.\n\nThe time interval for the implementation of the study protocol was 14 days. For each group (Treatment and Control) the minimum target number of participating patients and according to the inclusion criteria in this study were 30 people. The minimum total number of participants with 2 groups (Treatment and Control) is 60 people. (Rohrig B., 2010)\n\nRandom sample selection was carried out nationally from patients who entered the treatment room with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 at the three Multi-Center Research Implementation Hospitals (RSPAD Gatot Soebroto Jakarta, RSUP Dr. Sardjito Yogyakarta and RSUP M. Djamil Padang) in the period 3 months after the issuance of Ethical Clearance and Approval for Implementation of Clinical Trials from BPOM.\n\nThe sample size is calculated using the following formula:\n\nn1 = n2 = 2(Za+Z1-\u03b2)^2/ \u0394^2\n\nn1: the number of participants in the Exosome-MSC group n2: the number of participants in the control group Z\u03b1: standard deviation of type I error, 95% confidence interval (1.96) Z\u03b2: standard deviation of type II error, power 80% (0.84) SD: standard deviation of duration of recovery on standard therapy (5.90). (Voinsky I, 2020)\n\nMinimum expected difference in duration of healing (in days) when using Exosome-MSC compared to standard therapy (5) From the above calculation, the results of the calculation are N1 = N2 = 21.83 with rounding up each = 22 participants . To anticipate the adequacy of the number of participants , each group was added 8 participants , 30 participants each in the Exosome-MSC group and the control group so that the total number of participants was 60 participants.\n\nParticipants can be discontinued before the study is completed (drop-out) if they experience significant side effects and/or adverse events, both treatment related and non treatment related. Participants can also be discontinued before the study is completed (drop-out) if it worsens to a severe degree. All Participants will be discontinued from the study when the treatment and examination are completed according to the procedure.\n\nRandomization of patients into the intervention group or control group was made for each study site through the block 4 randomization technique. This process will be coordinated by the Team who will carry out the Research Management/CRO function.\n\nThe double-blind procedure is a procedure to avoid bias of researchers and research participants that will affect the results of data analysis. To apply this procedure, the Exosome-MSC test material specimen in the Treatment Group was dissolved in 0.9% Nacl. The dosage form will be disguised so that it is similar to Nacl 0.9% in the Control Group. Research participants and local researchers implementing in hospitals do not have knowledge about the status of the research group (arm). During the study, patients continued to take their usual routine medications, such as antihypertensive drugs, antidiabetic drugs, calcium, or folic acid. The treatment will be included as a confounding factor.\n\nResearch participants will be monitored closely. CLINICAL examinations are carried out EVERY DAY, starting from the baseline (day 0) to day 14.\n\nThe clinical examination consists of:\n\nbody temperature,\noxygen saturation,\nrespiratory rate,\nbreath difficulties,\ncough with phlegm,\nRT-PCR results\nstandard therapy.received\nallergic reactions,\nsecondary infection\nside effects/ adverse events (AE) that are life threatening.\nRemission score assessment based on 8 ordinal scales to determine Time to Clinical Improvement (TTCI).\n\nTTCI is the number of days until clinical improvement can be observed, as indicated by a score of 1-3 out of 8 ordinal scales.\n\nLaboratory examinations will be carried out on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14 (unless they have been discharged/recovered first) . On days 0 and 7 when the Exosomes-MSC injection therapy is administered, laboratory examinations were performed before therapy.\n\nLaboratory examinations consist of:\n\nC-Reactive Protein,\nferritin,\nD-Dimer,\nLDH\nFibrinogen,\nRoutine blood, type count (including lymphocyte count)\nPT and APTT\nSGOT/SGPT,\nurea/creatinine,\nelectrolyte K/Na/Cl,\n\nMeasures of intervention outcomes must be documented in a standardized Case Report Form (CRF) for each patient participating in the study.\n\nAdverse Events are any events, whether predicted or not, which can be related to the test material or not, this includes worsening of the clinical condition previously owned by the participant.\n\nSerious Adverse Events (SAE), include\n\nDead\nLife threatening Inpatient / Participant requires treatment as an inpatient\nAdditional length of stay *\nPermanent / significant disability\nCongenital abnormalities\n\nAdditional length of stay, defined as length of stay at any time. Hospitalization due to routine administration of standard therapy is not included in this definition. If the participant experiences an adverse event during the hospitalization period, the condition must be reported as an adverse event.\n\nAll adverse events identified from the start of the study (day 0) to day 14 will be recorded in the adverse event form in the case report form (CRF).\n\nIn the event of a Serious Adverse Events (SAE), researchers at the research site must report it to Dermama Biotechnology Laboratorium within 24 hours after it is known as the initial report, the report is addressed to: Dr. dr. Indah Hidajati Kampono, Sp.DV(K) Dermama Biotechnology Laboratory Jl.

                              "The cartilage is a unique avascular, aneural tissue that does not regenerate easily once damaged. Chondral defects or damages to articular cartilages due to accidents, necrosis of subchondral bone tissue, or arthritis have become some of the more common disorders today. About 15% of the world's population is reportedly suffering from cartilage and joint damages such as degenerative arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. As population aging progresses and as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of the target patient group is also growing. However, despite ongoing research, an effective treatment for cartilage defects is yet to be discovered. Various different types of treatments are currently in use, such as drug therapy, arthroscopy, and artificial joint surgery. However, they all fail to address the root cause. Complete treatment, or regeneration of damaged or defective cartilage is impossible and continuous drug administration or secondary surgeries are required in many cases.\n\nAs a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized damage to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few life science companies both home and abroad are marketing this method of treatment called 'autologous chondrocyte transplant'. The treatment involves the extraction of healthy cartilage tissue from the patient which is then cultured and transplanted into the damaged site.\n\nHowever, this treatment requires the extraction of chondrocytes directly from the patient and thus causes trauma in healthy articular cartilage. Also, this type of treatment cannot be applied to large lesions, nor is the efficacy satisfactory in patients over the age of 40 whose cellular activation levels are low. Thus, autologous chondrocyte transplant is rather limited in the number of cells harvested and their activation level and is therefore restricted in terms of treatment site, severity of the condition, and the size of lesion. The current technology allows the application of treatments in local cartilage defects but not in degenerative arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The technology needs to be taken up to another level in order to benefit such prevalent arthritic disorders. Treatments using stem cells do not cause damage to healthy articular cartilage as they don't require the harvesting of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients. Moreover, the number of successfully cultured cells is larger due to the excellent proliferation capability of stem cells and thus, mass supply is possible.\n\nThis clinical trial for the stem cell therapies is essential because treatment of cartilage defects with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, known to have the highest level of activity among all adult stem cells, opens the possibility of articular cartilage regeneration even for aged patients and patients with large lesions unable to benefit from existing treatments.\n\nThe biggest challenge faced by nations competing in the field of \"tissue differentiation and regeneration using stem cells\" is the question of whether or not the use of embryonic stem cells is ethical. Chondrogenesis using umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells can not only avoid similar challenges, but also present an innovative treatment mode with significant clinical implications for the patients.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured, mixed with semi- solid polymer, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery in order to stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

                              "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune-mediated necroinflammatory disease of the liver characterized by elevation of IgG, presence of characteristic autoantibodies, and histological feature of interface hepatitis. Standard therapy consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which is efficacious in 80% of patients. However, current treatment strategies are complicated by frequent relapse after drug withdrawal, medication intolerance, and refractory disease. Alternative medical therapy may be need for AIH.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in AIH patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus conventional treatment (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus conventional treatment. (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), \u03b3-globulin, total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA) and IgG, are detected at these time points. MELD score, Liver histology, treatment side effects, relapse rate and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of death for prematurely born babies with low birth weights. In addition, many children who recover from this disease suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is intended to treat BPD in premature infants. The purpose of the study is to evaluate 3-5 year long term safety and efficacy in patients who completed the earlier part of the phase I clinical trial of PNEUMOSTEM\u00ae."

                              "Study Design and Setting The study was carried out at the Internal Medicine Intensive Care Unit (IMICU) and Anesthesiology and Reanimation Intensive Care Unit (ARICU) at Erciyes University Hospital which is a referral hospital in the Central Anatolia. The study was approved by the Erciyes University Ethics Board (2016/114; Date: 19.02.2016) and Ministry of Health of Turkey. Informed consent from surrogate decision-makers was taken for study participation after confirmation of eligibility criteria.\n\nPatients The study was planned as prospectively. During two years, 10 patients with sepsis and septic shock were included in the study from IMICU and ARICU. Sepsis and septic shock were diagnosed according to the sepsis guidelines [1]. Inclusion criteria for this study were; patients who were between 18-80 years of age and were hospitalized at IMICU and ARICU with the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock. Exclusion criteria were categorized that patients who were younger than 18-year-old and older than 80 years and were pregnant women or breast-feeding; patients who had terminal stage of cancer, advanced pulmonary disease receiving oxygen at home, advanced pulmonary hypertension (WHO Class III or IV), advanced heart failure (American Heart Association Class III or IV), severe liver disease (Child C), and history of anaphylaxis. Standard therapy of sepsis as suggested in the guidelines [1,2] were given to all patients and additionally MSCs treatment was applied to the patients in the study group. Control patients diagnosed sepsis and septic shock and having similar characteristics for the consideration of severity of disease based on APACHE II score and co-morbid diseases with study group were selected from IMICU and ARICU records retrospectively.\n\nPatients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded.\n\nSource and Application of MSCs MSCs were prepared in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Laboratory of Genome and Stem Cell Center at Erciyes University. Cell production and quality control assessment procedures were carried out according to GMP protocols authorized by the Ministry of Health of Turkey. Allogenic adipose derived MSCs (ADMSCs) which were obtained from a healthy donor were applied to all patients in the study group. Five doses of ADMSCs were applied to the patients at 1st and 3rd day (post-thawed of frozen MSCs cryo-bag), 5th-7th and 9th day (re-plated ADMSCs vials) of therapy. Each dose of ADMSCs was prepared as 1 x 106 ADMSCs/kg. The vials containing ADMSCs were mixed with gentle motions before the usage; thus, it ensured product homogenization. ADMSCs were infused intravenously via central venous line in a physiological saline solution by using a blood transfusion set. The patients were monitored during all these procedures.\n\nPreparation of ADMSCs Sufficient cryo-preserved ADMSCs vials were thawed to provide the required dose for administration. The frozen ADMSCs were thawed and cultured in the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% human serum, 1% Penicillin- Streptomycin solution, and 1% stable glutamine (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 incubator which described before [16]. Briefly, ADMSCs were recovered and resuspended in physiological saline solution and transferred to the patient with the temperature-controlled bag. The morphology of cell appearance and the viability were assessed beside the identification of phenotypic characteristics of the cells and microbiological tests. Immunophenotyping characterization of ADMSCs was performed by using flow cytometry analyses (Beckman Coulter, USA) with antibodies against CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD44 (BD Stem Flow hMSC kit).\n\nCytokine Analysis Ten ml peripheral venous blood samples were collected before each MSCs infusion at 1st, 3rd,5th, 7thand 9th day of therapy. The serum samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes and stored at - 80\u00b0C until laboratory analysis. Cytokine level was analyzed with ELISA method by using Human BioSource for (TNF-, IFN- \u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10) kits in Robonik Read Well Touch model (Robonik India Pvt Ltd) device.\n\nClinical and Laboratory Follow-up Clinical findings and laboratory results were recorded at the administration of MSCs infusions at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th days. Patients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded. The patients were monitored for unexpected adverse events. In the clinical follow-up of the patients APACHE II, SOFA (the sequential organ failure assessment score) score, clinical progression and outcome of patients were recorded. As laboratory following, inflammatory markers; C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cell (WBC), bleeding parameters (platelets, INR, fibrinogen), lactate, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), renal functions (creatinine) were also recorded. Laboratory test results were analyzed according to MSCs administration days. The differences of the laboratory tests were compared between the survivor and non-survivor patients according to MSCs therapy days.\n\nOutcomes of the patients were compared with the previous observational study conducted in the same Intensive Care Units (ICUs) as control. The day of death and 0-6th, 7-14th, and 15-28th days were determined as survival status and endpoint. In case of death, the date and cause of death were also recorded.\n\nStatistical Analysis In the study, the results were compared to controls. Statistical analysis was performed using Turcosa software. The relationships between categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square analysis. When parametric assumptions were provided in comparison of numerical variables in two groups, the Student-T test was used and the Mann Whitney U test was in the case that the parametric assumptions did not provide. For the analysis of repeated measurements; Paired Sample T-Test was used for binary comparisons and the Repeated Measures ANOVA test was used for comparison of more than two repeated measurements. The survival probability of the patients during the follow-up period was determined by Kaplan-Maier survival analysis. The effect of age and APACHE II to co-variants analysis were adjusted. p <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant."
