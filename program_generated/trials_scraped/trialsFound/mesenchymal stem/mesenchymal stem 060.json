Forty patients aged older than 18 who have indications for haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be included to the study. MSCs will be isolated from donor bone marrows and infused to the patient after conditioning regimen on day +6. If the haploidentical transplantation results improve with MSCs treatment it would be possible to ameliorate the problem of HLA-matched donor paucity in Turkey and prefer haploidentical donors."

Therefore the investigators decide to inject the mesenchymal stem cell derived from iliac bone marrow after centrifuge with ficoll procedure to non union site in patient that are resistant to other treatment. Then the investigators will follow the patient with monthly radiography and evaluate the callus volume and clinical union and any side effect of this treatment.clinical union consider to relief pain in non union site and be stable in examination."

                              "Bone fractures heal most of the time particularly well and without complications. The solidification takes rarely more than two to three months. The wound healing depends greatly on a good blood supply and needs several steps. These processes culminate in a new mass of heterogeneous tissue which is known as the fracture callus. Unfortunately, 2%-5% bone fractures cannot achieve a proper solidification and between the ununited fragments a scar tissue appears. This incorrect healing induces pain and even infections. When this situation persists more than 6 months, it is referred to as nonunion fracture, which will require some form of intervention to stimulate the natural healing process of the body. First of all, good surgical techniques with stable immobilization should be applied and local infection should be excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Cell therapy with bone marrow cells has emerged as a promising new approach for bone regeneration. Animal studies as well as preliminary human studies have shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells, a particular kind of stem cells isolated from the bone marrow, could induce callus formation when injected in the nonunion site of a broken bone.\n\nIn this study the investigators aim at determining whether Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) isolated from the patient's bone marrow and injected in the nonunion site could be a safe and effective treatment for nonunion fractures. Patients will be randomized in two groups; one injected with Mesenchymal Stem Cell and the other injected with placebo. The investigators seek also to know how long it takes to develop the callus formation and whether there is a partial or a complete callus formation."

                              "Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination. The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs. Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin.Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow derived MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur center will perform a clinical trial with intra venous transplantation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell.our purpose is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of cell transplantation after 1year following up."

                              "The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue. Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized, single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed."

Survivors are typically left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness, quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No agent has been found to be highly effective in halting disease activity.Based on recent outcomes of Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, and based on the mechanisms of neuromyelitis optica, the investigators anticipate that mesenchymal stem cells transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for neuromyelitis optica patients."

The multipotent properties of MSCs make them a promising option for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).\n\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSC) have been used separately to treat OA. The aim of the present study will be to compare in a randomized non blind controlled clinical trial 3 types of intra-articular injections containing MSC populations obtained from two clinically relevant sources: BM-MSC, AD-MSC and a combination of both BM-MSC and AD-MSC."

                              "Despite being a miracle of modern medicine, solid organ transplant recipients are always at risk of rejection, and remain dependent on lifelong immunosuppression. Currently used immunosuppressive drugs suppress the potential of immune system and interfere with the metabolism of medications. Cellular therapies currently being investigated for this purpose require the use of ablative radiotherapy. The investigators are using a less toxic strategy by harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of the MSCs in the Kidney Transplant (KTx) recipients and studying immunomodulation mediated by these cells in the KTx patients.\n\nHypothesis MSCs interfere with signalling of Immune cells like T cells, B cells and Dendritic cells which leads to improve graft survival of renal transplant patients.\n\nAim To investigate effect of MSCs on immune cell repertoire in a donor specific mediated response.\n\nThe investigators aim to collect peripheral blood from 30 patients (10 patients for autologous cell infusion and 10 for allogeneic (donor derived cell infusion) at various time intervals following MSC therapy. 10 patients serve as controls on standard dose of drugs but without MSC infusion. This peripheral blood would be utilized for isolation of mononuclear cells and performing various immune assays on these cells in a donor specific response."

More randomization controlled studies are needed to confirm the effect of MSC treatment for ACLF. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in ACLF patients. This study is an double-blind multicenter randomized and placebo-controlled study. Patients with with ACLF will be randomly assigned to receive MSC treatment (experimental) or standard medical treatment (control). Three times of MSC infusion (0.1-1x10E6cells/kg body weight) via peripheral vein will be given to the experimental group (once per week). The primary outcome is 12 week mortality. Secondary outcomes are clinical remission rate and changes of liver function indices and liver function scores."

For this condition of disease the liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available ,but due to lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nPresently stem cells are used to be a one of the treatment for the same.

As the disease progresses the cartilage become frustrated, surrounding bone react to become thicker and inflammation occurs in subchondral bone seen in T2-weighted MRI as increase in signal density. Patients are treated initially by pain management. In patients who don't response to first line treatment invasive treatment like total knee replacement is done. The investigators designed this clinical study with the aim of evaluating therapeutic effects of intra-articular injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis."

Randomization controlled studies are needed to confirm the long term effect of MSC treatment for refractory PBC. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in PBC patients that do not respond to UDCA treatment. This study is an double-blind multicenter randomized and placebo-controlled study. Patients with with refractory PBC will be randomly assigned to receive MSC treatment plus UDCA or UDCA alone (control). Three times of MSC infusion (0.1-1x10E6 cells/kg body weight) via peripheral vein will be given to the experimental group (once in 4 weeks). The primary outcome is absolute change in alkaline phosphatase. Secondary outcomes are changes of other liver function indices such as ALT TBIL AST GGT, improve of symptoms and liver histology."

                              "Klinefelter syndrome KS is caused by an additional X chromosome in males (47,XXY). Clinical findings are nonspecific during childhood; thus, the diagnosis commonly is made during adolescence or adulthood in males who have small testes with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and gynecomastia. Virtually all men with Klinefelter syndrome are infertile.\n\nApproximately one in 1,000 boys is born with an additional X chromosome-47,XXY, the karyotype that causes Klinefelter syndrome. This karyotype is detected at or before birth in 10 percent of affected boys, and it is found during adulthood in 25 percent of affected men. Almost all men with a 47,XXY karyotype will be infertile; Klinefelter syndrome accounts for 3 percent of male infertility.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is common in infertile men with oligospermia or azoospermia (5 to 10 percent).\n\nInfertility in men with Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a precipitous drop in sperm count. If sperm are present, cryopreservation is useful for future family planning with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and if not, testicular sperm extraction may be pursued. Although there have been multiple reports of successful fertilization by men with Klinefelter syndrome.\n\nMesenchymal stem cell injection in testicular tubules and intra testicular artery using surgical microscope.\n\nThe period for follow up last from three months to twelve months including semen analysis to detect sperm and hormonal profile ."

These two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Universitario del R\u00edo Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. A phase I / II clinical trial with 10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region is proposed. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Follow up tests will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan."

No study was done in humans with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic effect of BM-MSCs in alcoholic cirrhosis as Phase II clinical study.\n\nMethods: Eleven alcoholic cirrhosis patients (M:F = 10:1) with Child-Pugh's class B and maintenance of alcohol abstinence at least 2 months were enrolled. At baseline, all patients received liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and serologic tests. BM-MSCs were isolated from each patient's BM and amplified for one month and injected two times at 4, 8week through Rt. hepatic artery. 5x106cells/mL of BM-MSCs were injected in each session. Follow up biopsy, HVPG and relative expression of tissue transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-\u03b21), \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen-1 by real time RT PCR were measured after 12weeks from 2nd BM-MSC injection. The primary outcome was improvement in patients' histology Aim :\n\nThe researchers aimed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of new therapy with bone marrow derived autologous mesenchymal stem cell for hepatic failure caused by alcoholic liver cirrhosis."

The kind of stem cells we are studying are called allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells or MSCs. MSCs are cells in the body that can grow into different types of cells and respond to various environmental situations. Allogeneic means the cells come from another person (a donor).\n\nThis study is only looking at whether or not it is safe to give the stem cells to adults with CF and how the infusion is tolerated. In the future, other studies may be done to see if stem cells can be a new therapeutic treatment for CF.\n\nStem cells, like other medical products that are intended to treat, cure or prevent disease, generally require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be marketed. The FDA has not approved any stem cell-based products for usual medical care, other than some specific blood forming stem cells for certain indications."

Mesenchymal stem cells promote tissue regeneration by differentiating into adult cell lines and by supplying growth factors to their implanted environment. They have been shown to be effective in improving both overall healing and tendon integrity in rotator cuff repair. This study will follow 100 patients in the United States and track their clinical outcomes for at least one year post-operatively."

In recent years, cytokine therapy has been an important strategy to promote tissue repair.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been considered the star cells that promote tissue repair. It works mainly through paracrine. Many biological effectors, including IGF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-\u03b21, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have been found and reported in various MSC conditioned media (MSC-CM), And play a role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration.

                              "A debilitating consequence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is neuropathy which globally affects between 20 -30% of diabetic patients and up to 50% in other studies. The incidence of diabetic neuropathy (DN) is estimated to be up to 45% for type 2 diabetic patients and 59% for type 1diabetic patients in USA.(DN) is the most common complication of DM.The pathophysiology of DN is promoted by several risk factors: micro vascular disease, neural hypoxia, and hyperglycemia-induced effects.At the molecular level, the primary cause of diabetic complications is known to be hyperglycemia, which disrupts cellular metabolism by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).In the aspect of nerve functions, ROS formation increases neuron's susceptibility to damage. In addition, hyperglycemia impedes production of angiogenic and neurotrophic growth factors, which are necessary for normal function of neurons and glial cells and maintenance of vascular structure.No definitive disease-modifying treatments have been to reverse DN. The current treatment focuses on tight glycemic control which can reduce potential risk factors for further nerve damage and DN-associated pain management.In many studies, deficiency of neurotrophic factors and lack of vascular support have been regarded as key factors in the development DN.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are particularly attractive therapeutic agents because of their ability to self-renew, differentiate into multi lineage cell types, and locally secrete angiogenic cytokines, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) .These factors were reported to prompt neovascularization and have support for neural regeneration.It was plausible that MSCs may also be an effective therapeutic agent for the DN treatment through the paracrine effects of bFGF (Shibata et al., 2008) and VEGF and their potential to differentiate into neural cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes , and Schwann cells.The adherent nature of MSCs makes them easy to expand in culture and an attractive candidate to use in cell therapy.Therefore, cell therapy has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy to meet the needs of both neurotrophic and vascular deficiencies of DN.Proper diagnosis of DN depends on the pattern of sensory loss, reflex test, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging"

                              "Treatment of extensive deep burn residual wounds is a common problem in burn plastic surgery. Due to bacterial invasion, excessive maturation of granulation tissue, poor abrasion resistance of new epithelium, and coexistence of wound healing and dissolution can lead to delayed wound healing. Residual wounds rarely heal spontaneously and are prone to recurrence. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) boost tissue repair through paracrine. Many biological effectors, including IGF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-\u03b21 have been found in MSC conditioned media (MSC-CM), and play a role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration.Our previous animal experiments have confirmed the role of MSC-CM in regulating wound inflammation, repairing damaged repair cells and promoting wound regeneration. In here, we will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium-derived pleiotropic factor in treating residual burn wound."

                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death from COVID-19. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the violent storm of cytokines and chemokines, which cause uncontrolled fatal systemic inflammation by the immune system on the body, with additional multiple organ failure. Mortality in cases of severe ARDS caused by COVID 19 varies significantly between 50 and 90%, basically depending on the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nThe plasticity of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) regulates inflammation and immunity. MSC can promote and inhibit an immune response, depending on the dynamics of inflammation and depending on the activation force of the immune system, the types of inflammatory cytokines present, and the effects of immunosuppressants. Essentially, the state of inflammation determines the immunoregulatory fate of MSC. Thus, IV application of AMSCa has been shown to control the inflammatory response in various diseases, such as the graft-versus-host reaction and the ARDS caused by H5NI.\n\nThe objective of this study is to describe the clinical changes secondary to IV administration of MSC allogenic, in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, with the evaluation of the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, heart and respiratory rates, and the fever curve.\n\nFive patients, of either sex, over 18 years of age, with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe SIRA that has not improved with the standard management measures used at that time in the care center, will be included in the study. This treatment will be administered after discussing it with the relatives that it is a procedure considered as rescue and will be carried out with informed consent. 1x10(6) xKg will be applied IV.\n\nThe follow-up of the patient will be for three weeks. PaO2 / FiO2 data, fever, inflammatory markers and immunity will be evaluated. The results will be compared with the historical controls attended at INCMNSZ."

                              "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.\n\nIn this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis, ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies."

Trials on treatment modalities have mainly used antivirals, interferon, glucocorticoids in addition to traditional Chinese medicine. There are also clinical trials exploring hydroxyquinoline/chloroquine sulphate, immunoglobulins, Vitamin-C, washed microbiota, nebulized interferon, teicoplanin as well as Mesenchymal stem cells. However, most of these trials were small (median sample size 100) and the bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase and currently there is no e\ufb00ective speci\ufb01c antiviral with high-level evidence.The aim of this study is assess the efficacy of MSCs as an add-on therapy to standard supportive treatment for patients with moderate/severe COVID-19."

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI."

                              "\u2022 The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous MSC application for the therapy of drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy. Adult (18-60 years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from refractory epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included in this study. The pts were randomized to the standard treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (control group, 30 pts) or anti-epileptic drugs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (study group, 30 pts). The pts in the study group received one intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded MSCs (40-101 x 106 cells) and one subsequent endolumbal injection of neuroinduced MSCs (2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cells). Both the unfavorable reactions to MSC infusions and the clinical effects, including complications, were examined. The unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS; i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia).The possible beneficial effects of therapy in the two groups of pts were examined based on clinical observations and electroencephalography measurements (prior and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy). To determine potential changes in disease progression, the signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and particularly, changes in seizure character and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The main points of disease monitoring were \"yes\" or \"no\" responses (to therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to evaluate electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves based on standard and additional criteria. The paroxismality index, the peak frequency of EEG activity, the index of slow activity, and the summarized points of EEG pathology signs were calculated for each patient. All assessments were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to identify the potential differences between the two pts groups. Therapy was terminated when immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The final observation of each patient included clinical and EEG assessments at the time point of 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy."

However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with permanent end ileostomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat people who have a peri-pouch fistula related to a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch."

While the available treatments seek to ameliorate pain or improve mobility, these treatments rarely modify the course of the disease, but rather attend to its consequences. For early stage osteoarthritis, treatment is largely limited to addressing the symptoms of inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs do not stop the progression of the condition or regenerates damaged cartilage.\n\nThis is a randomized and open labelled study aimed to determine the efficacy of intra-articular implantation of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis."

Currently approved reperfusion therapies are provided to only a small percentage of patients in the U.S. New therapies are needed that improve outcome and that can be accessed by a majority of patients. Animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered intravenously days after a stroke, safely improve long-term behavioral outcome. A large human experience suggests the safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The current study aims to assess the safety of this therapy in patients with recent ischemic stroke."

                              "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that selectively affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to bulbar, respiratory, and limb weakness. There is no effective treatment, and the disease usually progresses to death within 2 to 4 years. The therapeutic plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be an attractive therapy to this complex disease, turning MSCs strong candidates for cellular therapy in ALS.\n\nDesign-A phase 1 open-safety clinical trial. 4 patients will be selected according to a restricted inclusion and exclusion criteria and after 2 escalated infusions of MSCs, there will be a follow up period of one year Methods - Primary endpoint: safety of mesenchymal autologous stem cells infusions escalated in two intrathecal administrations in patients with ALS defined as severe adverse events (SAe). Secondary endpoints: clinical response, laboratorial and magnetic resonance imaging of patients submitted to cellular escalating doses applied in the study. Quality of life, according to El Escorial criteria, ALSFR scale and functional scales.\n\nConclusion: This study is a primary step before a large randomized double-blind clinical trial for ALS. It is expected to confirm the safety of escalated MSCs therapy in ALS patients, initial data of efficacy in addition to improved quality of life."

Hypogonadism affects about 4 to 5 million men in the US, and the incidence increases with age. In our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency."

Osteoarthritis is considered a chronic degenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss of articular cartilage. Pathogenesis can involve all of the major articular tissues including cartilage, synovial membrane, subchondral bone and other connective tissues such as ligaments and tendons3. There is no effective therapy available today that alters the pathobiologic course of the disease.In view of vast role of platelet derived growth factors, mesenchymal cells and its safety, this prospective clinical trial is designed in an attempt to compare the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells enhanced with platelet rich plasma in early stages of knee osteoarthritis."

Poor healing of the incision will increase the patient's pain and prolong the patient's hospital stay, and the choice of wound treatment is closely related to the wound healing effect. Mesenchymal stem cells mainly rely on paracrine effects to exert their therapeutic effects and obtain better therapeutic effects in wound healing. Here, the pleiotropic factors secreted from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-PFs) will be used to treat patients with poor healing after surgery to evaluate its effectiveness and safety."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been shown to be safe and effective for liver diseases in some studies. Randomization controlled studies are needed to confirm the long term effect of MSC treatment for liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in hepatitis B and C related liver cirrhosis patients.\n\nThis study is an open-label multicenter randomized control study. Patients with with decompensated cirrhosis will be randomly assigned to receive MSC treatment plus standard medical care(treatment\uff09or standard medical care (control). Three times of MSC infusion (1x10E6 cells/kg body weight) via peripheral vein will be given to the experimental group (once in 4 weeks). The primary outcome is absolute change in liver function indexes and and scores. Secondary outcomes are cirrhosis-related complications, symptoms, life quality, and survival."

                              "Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is the most frequent disease related to a premature birth, 15-50% of very low birth newborns (<1500 gr.) will develop BPD. The prevalence of BPD is increasing due to the advances in neonatology, with a rise in the survival of smaller and more premature babies. The etiology of BPD is multifactorial, in which oxygen, maternal chorioamnionitis, insufficient pulmonary maturation etc. have an important role. These factors lead to a pathological development of the lung and pulmonary vessels, developing secondary Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Nowadays there is no efficient treatment; this generates a important sanitary burden and a decrease in life quality. Multiple experimental models in mice have studied Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy as prevention of BPD, also recently some clinical trials have tried this therapy on premature newborns with promising results. Hypothesis: MSC therapy in patients at high risk of BPD prevents pulmonary lesions. Methods: The investigators have designed a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility and security of MSC therapy in patients at high risk of developing BPD."

Currently there is no effective drug treatment. The whole-lung lavage(WLL) can effectively clear the protein-like substances and inhaled dust deposited in the alveoli and bronchioles, as well as the pulmonary alveolar macrophage(PAM) and the resulting induced inflammation, fibrosis induced factor, serve to improve respiratory function, relieve symptoms of efficacy, but can't slow down or reverse the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nBy taking large volume whole-lung lavage (WLL) as a conventional therapy, this study intends to observe and evaluate the safety and efficiency of combined large volume WLL with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for treatment of Pneumoconiosis. Moreover, the immune regulation effect between large volume WLL and combined large volume WLL with MSC transplantation will also be preliminarily investigated and discussed."

                              "Background: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a potent alkylating agent that targets several organs, especially lung tissue. SM exposure leads to serious changes in morphological structure of airway system, which is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary deficiency following exposure to SM. With extensive progress and achievements in tissue repair through stem cells therapy, consideration of lung tissue has been increased due to the high prevalence of pulmonary problems. Several factors such as selection of cell types, required conditions for growth and proliferation of stem cells, and the process of entering into the body to repair damaged lung tissue are considered as the most important problems in this issue. Accumulating studies, both in animals and human with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) support the hypothesis of therapeutic effects of these cells in various disorders. In this study investigators aimed to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of systemic MSC administration for treatment of chronic lung injuries in SM-exposed patients.\n\nMethods: Patients will receive 100 million MSC cells every two months for three injections within 6 months. After each injection, parameters including safety, pulmonary function testing (PFT), quality-of-life indicators, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), and expression of inflammation and oxidative stress genes will be evaluated."

                              "Biliary atresia (BA) is the most frequent cause of chronic cholestasis in neonates, accounting for at least 50% of pediatric liver transplantation. BA incidence is estimated to range from 1:5000 to 1:19000 live births. All patients will die due to complications of liver cirrhosis if the operation is not performed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been found as a promising therapy for liver cirrhosis in adults. Bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation was also performed successfully for children with BA. Compared to MSC isolation from bone marrow, isolating MSCs from umbilical cord (UC) tissue is a less invasive procedure.\n\nFurthermore, UC-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for liver cirrhosis in adults and different pediatric diseases, including liver cirrhosis due to primary biliary cirrhosis. The investigators will compare the outcomes of 17 Kasai operated BA patients who receive UC-MSC transplantation to 17 BA patients who only undergo Kasai operation. Two transplantations of UC - MSCs will be performed via the hepatic artery: the first transplant will be performed at baseline, and the second one will be performed 6 months later with a dosage of 1 million MSCs per kg of body weight. The frequency and severity of the adverse events or serious adverse events associated with UC-MSC injection at 72 hours post-injection will be used to assess the safety. The efficacy of the therapy will be measured using Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score, liver function, and liver biopsy. This study would open a novel cell therapy to improve outcomes of patients with BA."

                              "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a disease characterised by pathological changes in the pulmonary arteries leading to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. Right ventricular failure is the main cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and the ability of the right ventricle to adapt to the progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance associated with changes to the pulmonary vasculature in pulmonary arterial hypertension is the main determinant of a patient's functional capacity and survival.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)are a subset of adult stem cells residing in many tissues, including bone marrow(BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues.It was found that MSCs can significantly improve the pulmonary hemodynamics, lung tissue gross and decrease the pulmonary artery pressure, middle artery thickness and right cardiac hypertrophy by intravenous injection."

                              "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory disease (AD), affecting both sexes and all races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monoclonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\n\nAccording to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair mechanisms, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College London for cell manufacturing."

                              "Progressive SSc is an entity with limited therapeutic alternatives and with asurvival rate of less than 45% in the first 3 to 5 years. The disease causessevere limitation in quality of life ranging from functional limitation to depression. Up to 20% of patients will be refractory to conventional treatment with diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and cyclophosphamide therapy.This favors the progression to visceral involvement including gastrointestinal,lung and pulmonary hypertension. The latter being a poor prognostic factor,increases mortality in this group of patients and drastically affects their qualityof life. For this reason, different therapeutic options have been considered including cell transplantation and Stem Cell use. Among the options that have been studied so far are stromal mesenchymal cells from Wharton \u0301s jelly. These have been used in intravenous infusion or direct application in different disease scenarios ranging from vascular involvement to interstitial lung involvement and cases of pulmonary hypertension, with promising results in terms of clinical progression,improvement in quality of life and prognostic indices. This therapy has proven to have a significant margin of safety at the time of administration and a low rate of adverse events, a self-limiting fever as the most frequent event. Based on the above and considering the possibility of offering patients without therapeutic alternatives to their disease in addition to palliative options, an intravenous infusion of stromal mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton \u0301s jellyis proposed for three patients with progressive SSc refractory to conventional therapy with pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension.\n\nUnder this premise the question posed in our work is; What are the effects of the infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells from Wharton \u0301s jellyin patients with systemic sclerosis refractory to conventional treatment with Methotrexate or Cyclophosphamide in a population of three patients with severe pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension."

                              "Although, effective immunotherapies for MS exist which downregulate the anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of the disease, there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce remyelination. Neuronal stem cells were shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.\n\nIn this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and restoration of neuronal function.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.\n\nSignificance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in general."

Investigators plan to systemically infuse MSCs 4, 6 or 8 days prior to enrolled subjects' planned prostatectomies. Investigators will then quantify the relative amount of donor MSC DNA to recipient DNA present in patients' explanted prostate specimens. This will be accomplished via BEAMing digital PCR. This trial will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at engineering MSCs to deliver a toxin to sites of metastatic prostate cancer."

                              "Despite the recent advances in medical and surgical treatment, heart failure resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) remains the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow.This study aims to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population."

Arthritis rheumatoid is an autoimmune disease which causes multi articular arthritis, such as knee osteoarthritis. As the disease progresses the cartilage become frustrated, surrounding bone react to become thicker and inflammation occurs in subchondral bone seen in T2-weighted MRI as increase in signal density. Patients are treated initially by pain management. In patients who don't response to first line treatment invasive treatment like total knee replacement is done. The investigators designed this clinical study with the aim of evaluating therapeutic effects of intra-articular injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in 60 patients with knee osteoarthritis."

                              "cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) about 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD."

                              "The prevalence of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per 100,000 population. The estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year. Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will develop MSA.\n\nThere are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a means of administering therapeutic agents.\n\nThe subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus clinical criteria for MSA. There will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5 subjects each.\n\nGroup 1 will receives MSC-Adipose Autologous with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally.\n\nGroup 2 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x 50 million cells intratechally.\n\nGroup 3 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally and 2x10cc secretome MSC from Adipose Intravenously.\n\nClinical improvement will be evaluated using the UMSARS scale, PET-Scans, MRI, DaTScan, IGF-1, BDNF, Sympathetic skin respons (SSR), EMG, Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS), High definition-Optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), ERG, VEP, Log MAR chart, Ishihara test and side adverse effect on MSC.\n\nThis study is divided into six timeframes : Before an implantation, First Month after second implantation, Third month after secondary implantation, Sixth month after second implantation, Ninth month after second implantation and Twelve month after second implantation. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to assess clinical improvement within the subjects."

                              "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive genetic disease always progressed slowly\uff0ctends to leading proximal skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness of limbs, as well as impaired respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle. To a large extent, patients always lose motor function gradually and die for heart failure or severe infection at the end stage of DMD. At present, the treatment strategy relies on heteropathy accompanied with rehabilitation training. However, the therapeutic effect remains extremely limited.\n\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have been evidenced to improve motor function, increase muscle strength and reduce abnormal levels of related enzymes, such as creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This study is aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSCs transplantation for DMD."

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as disease-modifying agents (DMDs).\n\nUnfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the deleterious immune reactions. According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS, an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune process, to protect axons and neurons from degeneration, and to enhance repair and facilitate remyelination.\n\nA specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown remarkable ability to modulate the immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs in people with MS."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to have immunosuppressive properties. Following a bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant, a proportion of patients develop a condition called 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD). In this condition the transplanted cells recognize the recipient as foreign and bring about an immune-mediated destruction of tissues. The treatment for this condition is to use drugs that will cause immunosuppression. A small subset of these patients develop a severe form of GVHD (Grade III or IV) which, in spite of the best currently available treatment, is associated with eventual death in more than 90% of cases. The investigators propose to use infusions of expanded MSC from the donor to treat this condition. A few reports on this approach have already been published in peer reviewed journals and preliminary results appear to be promising. The investigators are also aware that larger trials have been initiated to study this. After getting written informed consent, the investigators will infuse expanded MSC into patients who develop steroid-resistant GVHD."

Currently there is nearly no effective clinical treatment for late post-radiotherapy pulmonary fibrosis. This study intends to carry out an open, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial. During the treatment, the local lesions will be fully lavaged, and then clinical grade umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. After six-month observation, the investigators will initially evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment by measuring two key indicators-the CT density histogram and the patients' self-evaluation, and one secondary indicator-the changes of TGF-\u03b21 contents, both before and after the treatment. Meanwhile, the investigators will make a preliminary discuss about the possible immunomodulatory effects of the umbilical cord MSCs."

Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial in 50 patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

Current management of osteoarthritis only aimed to relieve pain but not to resolve the degeneration of cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cell is one kind of adult stem cell that has potency in tissue engineering. Sources of mesenchymal stem cell are bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Researchers want to explore the potential of umbilical cord as the source of allogeneic MSC, because the gaining process of MSC is not invasive. Some countries have started some In vitro studies, Animal studies, and human research, but in Indonesia the study of mesenchymal stem cell implantation from umbilical cord in genu osteoarthritis management has not been reported. This study will be held into two years in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and include 9 participants minimally. The researcher also compares the efficacy and safety of MSC implantation from umbilical cord applied to genu osteoarthritis with synovial artificial and recombinant human growth hormone therapy."

                              "In this study the investigators propose to perform a Phase II Clinical Trial which seeks to evaluate the safety of cell therapy as a new treatment for patients who suffer from acute non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). If it is successful, a later study to assess efficacy will be performed.\n\nThis disease has an age-adjusted incidence rate of 10/100.000, and in many cases it results in blindness. Currently, there is no available treatment and second eye involvement occurs in approximately 15-25% of the cases.\n\nAll this background originates a particularly dramatic outcome for the patient. Therefore, it seems justified to evaluate new therapies that maintain or improve the visual function in these patients.\n\nThe Project includes a clinical trial whose purpose is the assessment of the safety of intravitreal administration of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with NAION, a product in clinical research phase (PEI No. 15-007) already approved for other human clinical applications (PEI No. 15-007).\n\nIt can be considered that the therapy with intravitreal injection of MSC is a treatment option in patients with acute NAION, since through the paracrine properties of these cells (secretion of neurotrophic, immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic factors) it may prevent or reduce the progression of axonal degeneration caused by this disease."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function.- Hormone therapy is used to treat female hormone deficiency and results in a significant improvement, but long-term use increases cardiovascular disease or cancer risk. Other treatments do not give apparent results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and effective treatments to achieve the requirements of improving health in general and sexual health in particularly in women. AD-MSCs have been widely used as autologous and allogeneic stem cell sources to treat numerous disease recently, and they have been proven to be safe. The phase I trial showed that administration of autologous AD-MSCs at the dose of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kg patient bodyweight was safe for patients with sex hormone deficiency. The therapy introduced potential improvement in sexual and general quality of life indicating by the increased FSFI. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

These two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Universitario del R\u00edo Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. The investigators propose a phase I / II clinical trial with 10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Checks will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan."

                              "Frailty is a health state related to the aging process in which multiple body systems gradually lose their built-in reserves. It is a medical condition of reduced function in older adults which is associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes such as falls, disability, admission to hospital, or need for long-term care. Currently, there is no specific medical treatment of frailty. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are undifferentiated cells that self-replicated, and some may change into a particular cell type. These cells go to areas of injury due to signals released by injured cells. Upon reaching, the target tissue, MSCs repair injury by releasing growth factors and immune modulators to assist in the body's repair process. This initial study will assess the practicability of using MSCs for age-related frailty and provide information for planning a future full study of MSCs for maximizing Veteran's functional independence."

The trial is based in our own previous results with autologous MSC (ongoing NCT01183728 trial). We propose here a multicenter, phase I-II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment of osteoarthritis (degrees II and III and IV). The assay consists of two arms with 15 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given an intra-articular transplantation of allogenic MSC, expanded \"Ex Vivo\" with our GMP-compliant procedure (MSV, PEI No. 10-134, authorized by the Competent Authority; same as in NCT01183728). In the control arm a standard treatment with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid shall be given. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability, quality of life and quantitative changes in structure and composition of cartilage determined by T2-weighted MRI relaxation (Cartigram) for one year."

                              "Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. When a person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes, these treatments can not reverse the all damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs directly into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who have had a heart attack and who have chronic myocardial ischemia with heart failure."

Pre-clinical studies demonstrated improvement of cardiac function by Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) therapy in particular by their paracrine and immunosuppressive properties. Investigators initiated the MESAMI program by the bicentric pilot phase and highlighted the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial injections of MSCs from bone marrow in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction, guide by the NOGA-XP system. The MESAMI program continues with the phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.The aim of this phase 2 study is to demonstrate a functional improvement, measuring peak VO2, at 3 months between the cell therapy group and the placebo group."

The purpose of the phase II trial is to compare the effect of MSC with standard of care in these patients. MSCs are a type of stem cells that can be taken from umbilical cord blood and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs being used for infusion in this trial are collected from healthy, unrelated donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory. Giving MSC infusions may help control the symptoms of COVID-19 related ARDS."

However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems. Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) replace hepatocytes in injured liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration. In this study, the patients with LF will undergo administration of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via peripheral vein transfusion to evaluate the safty and efficacy of UC-MSCs treatment for these patients."

Potential subjects must be screened and consented before enrolled.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of early intravenous infusion of allogeneic human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs or MSCs used in the following section) for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Eligible patients will receive a single dose of MSCs or placebo within 24 hours after stroke. Patients will be followed for 2 years post infusion for safety and efficacy (change in neurological symptoms and quality of life). Assessments will occur during transplantation and at 3,7, 14 days and1,3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after infusions of stem cells."

It has become increasingly essential to improve our clinical treatments. The most promising potential treatment options rely on stem cell-based therapies. A large body of evidence indicates that mesenchymal stem cells can promote wound closure of chronic wounds in animal models and in preclinical studies. MSCs efficacy depends mostly on their paracrine activity. All the bioactive factors and cytokines in MSCs secretions constitute can be collected in the conditioned medium. In here, stem cell-derived conditioned medium was further made into a lyophilized powder. Patients with chronic wounds were enrolled. The wounds in control group treated with fibroblast growth factor commonly used in clinical practice. The wounds in experimental group treated with lyophilized powder. The effectiveness and safety of lyophilized powder will evaluate for chronic wounds."

ALS is the most common of the five motor neuron diseases.Riluzole (Rilutek) is the only treatment that has been found to improve survival but only to a modest extent. It lengthens survival by several months, and may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset. It also extends the time before a person needs ventilation support.Stem cell transplantation is a new hopeful way to improve the patients conditions and reduce the period of disabilities."

It lengthens survival by several months, and may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset.

This can be prevented by treating these patients long-life with immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs lead to numerous side effects and fail to prevent the rejection occurring months later after the transplantation (chronic rejection). Recently, it has been shown that a particular type of cells present in the bone marrow, namely Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), when injected to a patient, suppress its immune system and increase success rates of blood cells transplantation. This outcome opens doors to investigate the potential of these cells to provide a valuable tool for improving solid organ transplantation without the need of high concentration of immunosuppressive drugs. The present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of MSC administration after liver or kidney transplantation."

We plan to include 100 patients who met exclusion criteria of rotator cuff and lateral epicondylosis (tennis elbow) respectively by MRT or ultrasonography. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups. Adipose mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue, cultured and then transplanted back to the tendon injury site by multiple point injection. 1*10^6 cells as an unit. Patients in the experiment group will be injected into an unit of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (1*10^6/10kg) while the control group received the same dose compound betamethasone injection. Follow up visit for all patients will occur at 1\uff0c3\uff0c6 and 12 months after the first injection. Clinical quantitative assessment will measure by the visual analogue scale(VAS). The secondary outcomes are the constant-murley score(CMS) and the rating scale of the American shoulder and elbow surgeons(ASES) and the disability of arm shoulder and hand(DASH). The objective evaluation methods is that the examination of MRI or ultrasound were accomplished before the first injection and at 6 and 12 months afterwards."

Moreover, CNI cannot prevent long-term allograft inflammation and fibrosis.\n\nMesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) have potent immunomodulatory properties potentially promoting allograft tolerance and ameliorating toxicity of exposure to high dose CNI. Previous trials for non-solid organ transplant indications have shown an excellent safety profile of intravenous MSC application.

                              "Heart attacks are a leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. When a person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes, these treatments can not reverse the original damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of injecting MSCs into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who have had a heart attack and who are having heart surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)."

Today, there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and in more advanced stages the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells found from embryonic mesoderm and found in all tissues. In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. Our approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction."

Our and other previous studies have demonstrated that marrow bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) or unbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) infusion is clinically safe and could improve liver function in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, the long-term outcomes of MSC infusion have not been reported until now.

                              "Many patients with osteoarthritis of the knee fail non-operative measures and elect to have knee arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. If successful, intra-articular mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections into the knee may offer another viable non-operative treatment modality. Additionally, this modality may have reparative or regenerative potential, which could lead to the first treatment for osteoarthritis that treats the underlying disease as opposed to symptomatic control.\n\nAdditionally, there are no acceptable non-surgical treatments for focal chondral defects of the knee. Surgical treatments that do exist have diminished outcomes if performed on patients older than age 30-40 years. If successful, intra-articular MSC injections into the knee would represent the first non-operative treatment for focal chondral defects and also represent a potential option for treatment in patients over the age of 30-40 years.\n\nThis trial will be a prospective, single-center phase I pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in 16 subjects, 8 who have knee osteoarthritis and 8 who have a focal chondral defect in the knee. Patients will undergo a bone marrow harvest procedure at the Dahms Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MSCs will be isolated and expanded. After approximately 2-3 weeks, patients will return for an intra-articular injection of 50x106 MSCs Subsequent study visits will occur on post-injection day 7 and months 2, 6, 12, and 24. Safety of intra-articular injection of MSCs will be evaluated at study visits by interval history, physical examination and assessment of any adverse events that are observed/reported. Additionally, efficacy will be evaluated by having patients complete functional outcome measures including: Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and Lysholm Knee Scale. These will be completed at the pre-treatment visit and then repeated at the 2, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up visits. Lastly, T1 rho and T2 mapping on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess for improved cartilage quality after intra-articular injection of MSCs. An MRI will be obtained at the pre-treatment visit. At the 12 and 24 month follow up visit, additional MRIs will be obtained and analyzed to compare the pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MRIs."

Group 1 injected with The UC-MSCs at a dose of 2 million cells / cm3 using a 1 cc injection syringe (27G) by intra-lesion injection and booster with CM UC-MSCs at a dose of 1 cc / cm3 using a 1 cc injection syringe (27G) by intra-lesion injection and booster with CM UC-MSCs at the same dose 3 weeks later. Group 3 injected with Triamcinolon acetonide (TA) at a dose of 40 mg / cc / cm3 using 1 cc (27 G) syringe and booster with TA at 3 weeks later. The study subjects each group amounted to 7 patients suffering from Keloid. Patients were evaluated for 3 months after injection."

                              "Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that leads to permanent functional and neurological deficits in injured individuals. The limited ability of the Central Nervous System (CNS) to spontaneously regenerate impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery of the spinal cord. The leading causes are motor-vehicle crashes, sports-associated accidents, falls, and violence-related injuries.\n\nUnfortunately, there is still no effective clinical treatment for SCI. In recent years, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine based approaches have been proposed as alternatives for SCI repair/regeneration. Mesnchymal stem cells (MSC) use in SCI showed promising results in several studies. Our aim is to assess and compare the safety and effectiveness of autologous BM-MSC vs autologous AT-MSC in these patients."

                              "Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) which may cause acute life-threatening morbidity or chronic disabilities. Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating GVHD. Therefore, the investigator designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute or chronic GVHD."

                              "The major limitation to long term survival in lung transplant recipients is the development of graft failure over time, termed bronchiolitis obliterans. The conventional therapies used to prevent rejection are not effective in preventing bronchiolitis obliterans. Therefore, new therapies are needed to address this problem. A growing body of research has focused on a unique population of bone marrow cells termed Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to improve a range of medical conditions including heart failure, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. MSCs can prevent animal models of bronchiolitis obliterans. Because of this information, it is plausible that MSCs could help patients as a potential treatment in lung transplantation.\n\nThis proposal will test the immunologic properties of MSCs generated from such individuals to answer the question of whether generation of whether it would be feasible to use such cells in the future to prevent entities such as bronchiolitis obliterans.\n\nThe Investigator will approach patients who are being considered for a lung transplant because of end stage lung disease. Enrolled patients will undergo a bone marrow aspiration where a small amount of fluid is removed from their pelvic bone. Cells obtained in this procedure will be expanded in the Emory/Georgia Tech Cell Lab. MSCs will be expanded in this lab using cell culture conditions which are standardly used for MSCs."

                              "Immunomodulatory therapies to treat the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS) are designed to ameliorate the inflammatory processes that mediate the damage to the central nervous system (CNS) and to delay progression of the disease. To date, there is no effective means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single injection of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the effects of BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological, immunological and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow aspirates, purified by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single dose of autologous BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and immunological assessments will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at 1, 3, and 6 months after transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after transplant. Proposed trial will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a feasible and safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an environment of immune tolerance and through the local production of neurotrophic/growth factors, might induce neuroprotection and improvement in CNS function."

On the other hand it seems that the use of the mesenchymal stem cells can irritate the union rate. Also for better result we used the mesenchymal stem cells with BMP2 in collagenic scaffold. The collagen has a osteoconductive effect and BMP2 and stem cells has a osteoinductive effect therefore this combination is useful in filling the gap in non union site and irritate the union rate.\n\nMesenchymal stem cell derived from iliac bone marrow after centrifuge with ficoll procedure. Then the investigators will follow the patient with monthly radiography and evaluate the callus volume and clinical union and any side effect of this treatment.

                              "Pulmonary hemosiderosis (PH) is a pulmonary hemosiderin deposition which caused by alveolar capillary hemorrhage. PH is easy to recurrent and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and insufficiency if the disease was poor controlled. Steroid is the most common drug that was administered in acute phase of the disease. However, considered the side-effects, steroid is not suitable for long-time maintenance. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a new therapy. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) are a kind of adult stem cells with high self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation potential in bone marrow. It has become a hot topic in immunosuppressive and tissue repair therapy in recent years. To date, homing, colonization and differentiation of BMSCs in the lung have been observed in animal models of pulmonary hypertension, radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. It had been reported that BMSC transplantation in acute lung injury in mice, inflammation of lung injury can significantly improve. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of BMSC on PH and its mechanism, and to explore a new way to promote the repair of IPH. It is expected to improve the status of IPH therapy in children, especially improve the prognosis of refractory PH."

                              "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease of motor neurons. In the early 1980s, Werdnig from Vienna University and Hoffman from Heidelberg University described this disorder. So SMA type 1 was named Werdnig- Hoffman disease. This is the first genetic disorder that cause death after cystic fibrosis in infants with the prevalence of 1 in 6000 birth. Mutation in the SMN1 gene (Survival Motor Neuron) is the reason for the disease that cause decrease in the SMN protein production. So the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord ventricle horn will be destroyed and it cause progressive paralysis and defenite death.No specific therapy is yet available for the treatment of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. Treatment is not disease-modifying and just is supportive. SMA type 1 is diagnosed within the early 6 month after birth and accompanied with breath disorders and definite death in 2 years. The affected infants have a weak muscle tone and they couldn't even hold their head up. Perhaps the only open way for these patients is the application of stem cells that could deliver trophic factor to the apoptotic cells. So this study focuses on the effectivness of cell therapy via adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells on the probable phenotypic changes in these patients."

The outcome for patients is poor and overall survival low, with few patients alive at 2 years.\n\nIn the case of failure after corticosteroid treatment, different therapeutic options have been introduced as second or third-line strategies. In this scenario, infusion of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has emerged as an additional tool for treatment of GVHD.\n\nThe purpose of this work is conduct a study in patients with refractory and/or resistant GVHD corticosteroids treatment. It will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive the MSCs and the other group will follow the acute GVHD steroid-resistant and/or refractory treatment according to the routines of the Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) service of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. It will be evaluated aspects of immune recovery early after MSCs infusion."

                              "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the end of 2019 has seen numerous patients experiencing severe acute lung injury (ALI), which developed into severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality was as high as 20% -40%. Due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments, supporting treatment is the predominant therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Its cure is essentially dependent on the patient's immunity. While the immune system eliminates the virus, numerous inflammatory cytokines are produced and a cytokine storm occurs in severe cases.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in injury repair and immune regulation, showing advantageous prospects in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. MSCs prevent cytokine storms by retarding the TNF-\u03b1 pathway, alleviate sepsis by modulating macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, DC cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. After infused, MSCs aggregate in the lungs, improve the lung microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelia, and improve pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary function."

                              "Diabetes is a major concern in public health because of its high frequency and its negative consequences. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is present, regardless of age, in 50 to 75% of men with diabetes. It is related to endothelial dysfunction and a decrease in smooth muscle and nerve cells. In type 1 diabetic patients, ED is part of the chronic complications of microangiopathy. Current therapies are exclusively symptomatic with moderate efficacy, estimated between 44 and 56%. The administration of culture-grown medullary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would be a curative treatment and have the advantage of being single injection.\n\nHowever, the data in the literature do not allow to define the optimal dose of MSC in this indication. In addition, the feasibility of this procedure is not known at present.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy of intracavernous injection of autologous MSC (bone marrow-derived MSCs) administered in a 4-dose-escalating design in patients from 18 to 50 years old with complicated type 1 diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction."

The trial is based in previous results with autologous MSC (Orozco et al., Transplantation 92: 822-828; 2011). Here we propose a phase I-II trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment DDD using MSV, a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant expanded bone marrow MSC (MSV, PEI Num. 10-134). The assay consists of two arms with 12 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given a single intra-discal transplantation of MSV (25 millions in 2 ml). Control patients will be infiltrated in the paravertebral muscles close to the lesion with 2 ml of 1% mepivacain. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability and quality of life as well as disc fluid content by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (T2-calibrated)."

                              "Lipodystrophies are part of a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by loss (lipoatrophies) and / or accumulation of fat, which usually results in a change of normal tissue surface. Millions of plastic and reconstructive surgeries are performed annually to repair soft tissue defects due to trauma, tumor resection and congenital defects. Surgical options for lipoatrophy, the lipodystrophy type characterized by subcutaneous adipose tissue atrophy, include: Transfer of autologous fat, Dermis - fat graft, Skin flaps and Commercially available fillers.\n\nCurrently, the most commonly filler agent used for the lipodystrophy treatment is polymethylmethacrylate, considered permanent and with a history of short- and medium-term adverse effects. Biocompatible and temporary filler agents such as hyaluronic acid, polylactic acid and collagen have been used for over 25 years for cosmetic purposes and in lipoatrophies. More recently, the use of autologous fibroblasts proved to be efficient solving acne scars and enabling dermis regeneration. Studies in mice showed that the combination of pre - adipocytes with a biomaterial is much more effective in tissue reconstitution than the injection of adipose tissue only, providing volume and also stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation with increased production of extracellular matrix.\n\nThis project aims a phase I clinical trial of a filler agent, composed of mesenchymal stem cells derived from autologous adipose tissue associated with hyaluronic acid."

                              "Hemophilia is caused by a single-gene defect resulting in familial bleeding disorder. Small increase in gene products could transform a severe form of hemophilia into a mild one. Stem cells from extrahepatic sources are being considered for clinical applications in liver cell therapy as they possess high in vitro culture potential and could be used in transplant procedures. We studied the differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs) from hemophilia patients' relatives into factor 8 (FVIII)-producing hepatocyte-like cells aiming to expand patients' donor options for partial replacement of mutant liver cells by healthy cells in hemophilia A patients which could manage the severity of the bleeding disorder.\n\nBM-HSCs from hemophilic families will be cultured in short-liquid hepatic induction medium. Appearance of hepatic phenotype will be evaluated by alpha-fetoprotein expression using immunocytochemistry. Functional evaluation of transdifferentiation will be done through detection of albumin synthesis using microalbumin assay kit, factor VIII activity by one-stage clotting assay and expression of FVIII messenger RNA( mRNA) by reverse transcription ( RT-PCR).\n\nInducing the differentiation of BM-HSCs by in-vitro manipulation may become a valuable tool to provide a cell source for hepatocyte transplant procedures for treatment of hemophilia patients."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is one kind of stem cell which is gained form adult tissue. Although MSC derived from autogenic bone marrow are proven to help regeneration in non union fracture and long bone defect, the aspiration process through iliac crest is invasive and painful.\n\nTherefore, alternative source of MSC which is less invasive is needed. Adipose and umbilical cord is a \"waste product\" that proven to contain enormous MSC. Furthermore adipose and umbilical cord as an allogenic source is more abundant in number compares to autogenic bone marrow. This enormous source need and adequate preservation technique before applied to the patient. According to that, researchers want to explore the potency of MSC from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose as the source of allogenic MSC and the effect of cryopreservation technique to the viability and quality of MSC. We will also compare the effectivity of MSC implantation from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose applied to non union fracture and long bone defect.\n\nSamples from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose are cultured and the viability of the cells are observed. Some of the cells are implanted directly to the patient with non union fractures and long bone defect while some are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen -190 degree Celsius in three months. All samples are thawed and the viability of the cells are observed. Patient who are implanted by MSC allogenic will undergo clinical and radiological examination in the third, sixth and twenty second month after implantation."

                              "In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency, drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.\n\nThe study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial, involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24 months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI."

                              "Liver failure (LF) is a dramatic clinical syndrome with massive necrosis of liver cells. Although liver transplantation provides an option to cure patients suffering with LF, lack of donors, postoperative complications, especially rejection, and high cost limit its application. Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) the novel and promising therapeutic strategy, BM-MSCs can replace hepatocytes in injured liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration. Plasma exchange (PE) can improve internal environment by removing endotoxin, it helps the liver regeneration and functional recovery and make UC-MSC differentiation into hepatocyte like cells, and exert immunomodulatory function. In this study, safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) transplantation combined with plasma exchange (PE) for patients with liver failure caused by hepatitis B Virus will be evaluated."

Hemarthrosis is one of the most frequent complications in hemophiliacs and leads to the development of severe and early arthropathy, sometimes as early as childhood. To date, there is no curative treatment for these joint disorders and preventive treatments are insufficient to completely prevent joint degradation. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to be of therapeutic interest in the management of pathologies such as osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis through their anti-inflammatory, regenerative and anti-apoptotic effects.

MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from progression to advanced heart failure."

The survival and incorporation of the BMAC labeled cells will be evaluated with MRI using the Ferumoxytol infusion stem cell labeling technique. The second arm of the study evaluating cell fate after injecting stem cells under a rotator cuff repair will also be explored.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to 1) determine which surgical intervention leads to better clinical outcomes as measured by Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 12 months, and 2) determine who long we can track the labeled-BMAC cells in the knee."

In treating these conditions, the conventional method were vascularised bone grafting and bone transport. But the existing methods of treatment have many weaknesses Vascularized bone graft is a procedure with a high level of difficulty. Hence not every orthopaedic surgeon were able to perform it. It also takes more operating time and its failure rate is also quite high.\n\nMeanwhile, external fixation which is applied with bone transport, was being often complained by the patient in terms of cosmetic and psychologically.\n\nAccording to diamond concept of bone healing, there are four main factors that influence the bone healing. These factors are osteogenic factor (mesenchymal stem cell), osteconductive factor (HA-CaSO4), osteoinductive factor (bone morphogenetic protein-2) and mechanical component (implant). The potency of each component in fracture healing with/out bone defect has been proved in many studies. The combined effect of these components is often studied as well, but not in critical-sized bone defect."

After signing a consent form, participants will be randomized into two treatment groups. Group-A (NA=10) will receive crestal placement of implants following a two-stage protocol in combination with a biocomplex comprising autologous alveolar bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities and seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with autologous fibrin glue. In Group-B (NB=10) implants are placed on the alveolar crest following a two-stage protocol and the manufacturer's guidelines. Intra-surgical clinical and radiographic assessments are performed at the time of implant placement (T0) and at the two-stage surgery (T1). Changes in mucosa thickness, width of keratinized tissues, marginal bone and bone thickness at the surgical site will be determined at T0-T1. Groups will be further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical site at T0 [thin mucosa (\u22642.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (>2.5mm) for Groups-AII/-BII]. A linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine changes in the dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two stage-implants placed either conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex."

It affects the rectum and extends proximally along a variable length of the colon. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition with a relapsing remitting course. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a subset of adult stem cells residing in many tissues, including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues. The purpose of our study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope of allogeneic adipose MSCs in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis."

Previous research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of delivering bone marrow cells including MSCs to chronic wounds with significant improvement in healing and scarring. Application of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to severe burn wounds represents an opportunity for improved outcomes where alternate therapies are limited and often ineffective.\n\nIn this protocol, 2nd degree burn wounds will receive direct application of EVs derived from bone marrow MSCs. We have observed success with this type of approach in the past using bone marrow stem cells including MSCs. We have evidence that EVs derived from MSCs are responsible for many of the healing effects produced by MSCs and may be a safer, more reliable alternative to allogeneic cell therapy. This protocol is designed to develop a safe and ideal method of administering bone marrow cell Extracellular Vesicles to wounds."

First, MSCs must be plastic-adherent when maintained in the standard culture conditions. Second MSCs must express CD105, CD73 and CD90, and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19 and HLA-DR surface molecules."

                              "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of economy and medical level, the number of cases of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) develops rapidly in China. In 2019, 12,323 cases of HSCT were completed in China, with allo-HSCT accounting for 9600 cases of which.\n\nHowever, Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the most common and serious complications after Allo-HSCT. The incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) is as high as 40%-60% in HLA-matched sibling transplantation, and the incidence is even higher in haplo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(haplo-HSCT) and unrelated donor transplantation. By Glucksberg grading standard, the 5-year survival rates of grade III and IV aGVHD are 25% and 5% respectively, indicating severe GVHD directly affects the survival of Allo-HSCT patients.\n\nThe first-line treatment for aGVHD is still glucocorticoid, while the effective rate is only 30%-50%. Moreover, due to immunosuppression and increasing risk of infection, the efficacy of second-line treatments including polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, immunotoxins, chemotherapy drugs, and light therapy for steroid resistant aGVHD is also poor, with the overall survival rate of 5%-30%.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells, which can promote engraftment and hematopoietic reconstruction by secreting a variety of hematopoietic promoting factors, expressing adhesion molecules supporting hematopoietic stem cells, guiding homing of hematopoietic stem cells and providing hematopoietic microenvironment. At the same time, MSCs can modulate immune responses by affecting the proliferation of T cells and the migration of T cells and DC, inducing the expansion of Treg cells, inhibiting the secretion of antibodies by B lymphocytes, and regulating the secretion of soluble factors such as NO and IDO. As a result of these characteristics and the poor immunogenicity, MSCs are a promising alternative treatment for GVHD.\n\nCurrently, UK and EU guidelines has recommended MSC as a third-line treatment for grade 2-4 acute GVHD, and the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived MSCs in the prevention and treatment of GVHD has also been reported by several transplantation centers in China.However, MSCs have not been used for first-line treatment of aGVHD. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs as the first line treatment in patients with aGVHD."

These vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling, and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nThis clinical study will be performed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in healthy volunteers."

An estimated 7.18% of the Chinese (about 93 million) is infected with hepatitis B, and most of the HBV- related hepatitis can developed into liver cirrhosis.\n\nLiver transplantation is the only available life saving treatment for patients with end stage liver disease. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess plasticity and have the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte; Thus, MSCs hold great hope for therapeutic applications. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) exhibit a more beneficial immunogenic profile and greater overall immunosuppressive potential than aged bone marrow-derived MSCs. Like MSCs derived from bone marrow, hUC-MSCs can also be used to treat rat liver fibrosis and improve glucose homeostasis in rats with liver cirrhosis. In this study, the patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis will undergo administration of hUC-MSCs via hepatic artery to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSC treatment for these patients."

According to the previous single center study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) had an effect to prevent rejection and DGF after renal transplantation, but there was no perspective multicenter controlled study to confirm it. This perspective multicenter controlled study will focus on clarifying the key role of MSC applied via renal arterial or peripheral vein injection, to reduce the rejection and DGF after renal transplantation. The investigators have established GMP workshop and solid research foundation of transplant rejection. This study will provide a new reasonable way for immune induction of renal transplantation by DCD."

Since dual administration of UCMSC via IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion."

Spoke wheel injury, road traffic accident are common mode in the children. Oestern and Tscherne have classified soft tissue injuries into four grades from 0-4. The treatment of Grade 0 and 1 injuries is typical cleansing and application of a moist wound healing dressing. But further grades need surgical management with debridement and reconstruction. Grade III and IV can be reconstructed by using graft, flaps or various other techniques. . Skin grafting offers poor functional and cosmetic results, although it is commonly performed with good take rates. mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord with informed consent from the mothers. This study will open a new avenue for the treatment of heel pad injury. . Since the use of stem cell (especially in Pakistan) is completely a new technique in the management of heel pad injury, it will provide insight for better management by accelerating the wound healing process."

After completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment those subjects who have at least one interdental osseous defect with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level of \u2265 6mm and an intrabony component of \u2265 3mm with no endodontic or furcation involvement are randomly allocated into one of the three treatment groups. Group A receives regenerative treatment using autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities and seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with fibrin glue; in Group B, a collagen fleece enriched with fibrin glue devoid of stem cells fills the osseous defect; Group C receives open flap debridement retaining the soft wall of the defect. Thereafter, subjects are followed for 12 months and are repeatedly assessed based on clinical, radiographic, immunological and microbiological parameters.\n\nIn a series of cases, tissue engineering in a similar manner to Group A will be applied to treat isolated periodontal interdental defects, in combination with the novel \"closed surgical technique\"."

He was emergently transferred to Miami, FL for stabilization and treatment, where he was diagnosed with a C5 -C6 Grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6: 7mm, with flexion teardrop fracture of the anterior aspect of C6, as well as jumped facet on the right and perched facet on the left at C5-C6 with spinal canal stenosis with cord compression, as well as with aspiration and near drowning. He underwent ACDF (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion) of C5-C6 and reduction of jumped facets and was immediately started on a hypothermia protocol to reduce spinal cord edema. His hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia. He discharged to Texas via air ambulance for physical rehabilitation on August 23, 2017 with a diagnosis of ASIA B (American Spinal Injury Association) C-5 SCI (spinal cord injury)."

Liver transplantation is currently the only method to improve survival. Current clinical research evidence shows that mesenchymal stem cells can reduce the mortality of ACLF patients and are safe. This study aims to explore the safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in the treatment of ACLF. The study population is ACLF patients with 1-2 organ failures. To explore the safety of 3 doses of UC-MSCs, 16 patients need to be enrolled. The main observation indicators are the short-term and long-term safety of the treatment. All patients need to receive the standard medical treatment (SMT) at the same time. Stem cell treatment is given by intravenous infusion on the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth day. The occurrence of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events(SAE) before and after the infusion will be observed. After the patient is discharged from the hospital, patients will be followed , the follow-up time is 5 years."

However, the critical shortage of donor organs, high cost, and the problem of immune rejection limit its clinical application, and even some patients on the waiting list will never survive to receive a matched liver. Stem cell transplantation instead of conventional medical therapy or orthotopic liver transplantation will be a promising alternate approach to regenerate damaged hepatic mass. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are generally thought of as an autologous source of regenerative cells in previous studies.In this study, the safety and efficacy of menstrual blood-derived stem cells transplantation for patients with liver cirrhosis will be evaluated."

PC is an extremely infiltrative neoplasm that usually presents with vascular and perineural invasion in surgically resected tumors. Metastases to lymph nodes, liver and distant sites are all very common. Its incidence has markedly increased over the past several decades and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Despite the high mortality rate associated with pancreatic cancer, its etiology is poorly understood. PC patients experience physiological symptoms such as anemia, ascites, severe fatigue, pain, cachexia, weakness, insomnia, confusion, and memory loss. The aggressive nature of PC leads to rapid deterioration of patients' quality of life and diminished ability to participate in treatment."

Recently, a gigantic proof-of-concept trial, CANTOS has demonstrated that inflammation of atherosclerosis can be effectively modulated by Canakinumab. However, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. There is, therefore, a clear need for cheaper and safe alternatives. The latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells and induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, which could reduce atherosclerosis in pre-clinical studies. Therefore, in this randomized, controlled trial, our aim was to assess the safety and the anti-inflammatory efficacy of intravenous infusion human umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem Cell (WJMSC) in patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis disease."

Oral corticosteroids have been to be the preferred drug for the treatment of PNS, but the long-term use of glucocorticoid therapy in clinic often induces some problems such as hormone dependent and hormone resistance, as well as severe side effects which act as a threat to the patients' health. Besides, patients with proteinuria long-term not control often behave faster progression into chronic renal failure, leading to poor prognosis. In renal diseases, Rituximab ( RTX) is often used in the treatment of refractory nephropathy, such as hormone dependent nephrotic syndrome, hormone resistance nephrotic syndrome, frequency recurrence nephrotic syndrome, which shows exciting effects in delaying the development of the disease.At present, mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) has been used as a research hotspot to repair the tissue damage of chronic kidney disease, and it also behaves certain effects. The purpose of this study is to seek a more targeted treatment, more precise curative effect and more feasibility treatment for PNS(CKD3-4),so as to delay or reverse the disease and improve the quality of life of patients with CKD."

Despite the ability of current immunosuppressive agents to reduce the incidence of acute rejection, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term toxicity associated with current regimens for liver transplant recipients now is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Here, we evaluate umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) as an alternative immunosuppressive agents for liver transplanted patients, and examine if UC-MSC could improve the recovery of liver function."

And the clinical use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells has been approved by FDA. However, the results are inconsistent from both human study and animal research, it often difficult to visualize the reconstruction of the motor circuits. A separate application of DTI could not precisely reveal white matter integrity. Combining blood oxygen level-dependent(BOLD)-functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) with diffusion tensor-based tractography (DTT), to detect neural activities in the brain involved in the motor function restore and then using the two seeds method to reconstruct the nerve fibers between these connecting regions. The main aim of this study: i. To characterize and evaluate functional and anatomical changes of nerve fiber injuries after umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation with BOLD drived-diffusion tensor imaging(DTI). ii. To determine the therapeutic efficiency of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and also the utility of the integration of BOLD-fMRI and DTI. iii.

In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated. We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight) at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the study.\n\nShould this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow.\n\nIn this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design."

                              "The exact origin of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. The current hypothesis is that IBD is secondary to an abnormal intestinal immun response directed to all or part of the intestinal flora in genetically predisposed individuals. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow or adipose tissue origin to control intestinal inflammation in animal models. However, to date, there are no data regarding the functions of resident MSCs in the colon and small intestine of IBD patients. We hypothesize that dysfunction of resident intestinal MSCs contributes to the disruption of intestinal homeostasis in patients with IBD causing the development of intestinal inflammation. The aim of this research project is to identify, describe and characterize at the molecular and functional level MSCs of the colon and small intestine of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to compare them with a control population."

                              "The chronic kidney disease is caused by renal structural and functional impairment for more than 3 months due to various causes, including normal and abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), abnormal blood, urine, and imaging findings, or an unexplained decline in GFR (<60 ml/min). Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.\n\nSummarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.\n\nCurrent treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease."

                              "There are about 240 million chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected people in the world, and about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients every year. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. Reversing or delaying the process of cirrhosis and reducing the development of compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is one of the effective methods for liver disease treatment. MSCs are mainly derived from bone marrow, but bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have some shortcomings, such as cumbersome sampling, and the proliferation and differentiation ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells decrease obviously with the age of donors, which is not conducive to cell therapy. Umbilical cord has many advantages, such as wide source, convenient collection, small immune rejection, and small ethical controversy, which makes it a hot spot in stem cell research and has a wider prospect in cell therapy. This clinical study will explore the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B virus-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis."

Remarkable progress has been achieved during last 30 years\uff0cstem cell therapy plays an important role in this progress. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and human cord blood mononuclear cells (hCBMNCs) have been shown to have the ability to modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising therapeutic strategy for burn. In this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCMSCs and hCBMNCs transplantation will be evaluated in patients with acute burn."

                              "Contour deformity of face causes both functional as well as aesthetic problems for the patient. Fat being an autologous tissue source is considered as an ideal soft-tissue filler because it is abundant, readily available, inexpensive, host compatible, and can be harvested easily and repeatedly. However absorption of grafted fat is a major problem resulting in lack of consistency of final clinical outcome. Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to enhance the viability of the grafted fat and the reliability of the final outcome of surgery. In the current study potential of mesenchymal stem cells will be studied by comparing two groups of patients requiring fat grafting for contour deformities of face. Control group will have fat graft with out enrichment with stem cells whereas experimental group will have their fat graft enriched with mesenchymal stem cells. Comparison will be made regarding viability of grafted fat in two groups."

The cartilage has no intrinsic ability to repair resulting at long term in function loss in the joints. Currently available treatments are not satisfactory in the long term, the use of mesenchymal stem cells appears to be promising due to their ability to multipotency and immunomodulation properties. This project aims to determine the most appropriate source for regenerative medicine of cartilage stem cells from tissue taken during arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis. These cells will be tested for different chondrogenic markers. The success of this project will consider the implementation of a strategy for regenerative medicine in bone and joint diseases."

                              "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infectious disease characterized by acute respiratory impairment due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."

Other inclusion criteria are age 20 to 75 years and a serum total bilirubin of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/dL, or if the total bilirubin is <3.0 mg/dL, patients who are still deemed unsuitable as a candidate for general anesthesia. About 30 mL of autologous bone marrow was collected from the bilateral iliac crests under local anesthesia, heparin was added after collection. In addition, at the Center for Regenerative and Cell Therapy at Yamaguchi University Hospital, a nucleated cell fraction was prepared. Next, a cell suspension was prepared by adding culture medium, and this was inoculated into a culture flask. After subculturing for 3 weeks, the cells were infused through a peripheral vein. The primary endpoint is the incidence of adverse events up to 24 weeks after ABMSC infusion."

                              "Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or known as Covid-19 has recently become a global health emergency since it was first detected in Wuhan, the People Republic of China in December 2019. Since then, the prevalence has rapidly increased worldwide. In Indonesia, by the end of April 2020, around 10,000 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19 infection, with a case fatality rate of around 8%.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Covid-19 is still under investigation and to our understanding, ACE2 receptors in the alveoli serve as the binding site of the S-protein of envelope spike virus of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 enzyme aids the fusion between cell membrane and capsid of the virus, allowing penetration of virus into the cell. Vesicles containing virion fuse with cell membrane and released as new virions. Cytopathic effect of the virus and its ability to overcome immune response determines the degree of infection.\n\nDifferences in immunological profile among degrees of severity of Covid-19 may vary especially for the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia-inhibiting factors (LIF), immunological markers such as CXCR3+CD4+, CXCR3+CD8+ T cell and CXCR3+ NK cells, implying the ongoing cytokine storm. The previous studies also found increasing number for infection markers such as procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. The decreasing number of anti-inflammatory cytokines in such as IL-10 also supports this finding.\n\nPrevious studies have shown immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory capacity of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs contributed to the shifting of pro-inflammatory Th2 into anti-inflammatory Th2. One of the most recent study on the usage of MSCs on Covid-19 patients showed increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which give rise to inhibitory effect of T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell population. Vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is found increasing following MSCs administration, which indicates the ability to improve the disrupted capillaries due to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The ability of MSCs in differentiating to alveolar cells is proven by the presence of SPM and SPC2, surfactant proteins produced by type II alveolar cells. MSCs are unable to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 since they don't have ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 enzyme."

The investigators compare the intraarticular injection of hialuronic acid against the administration of two different doses of mesenchymal stem cells with hialuronic acid according to the following scheme:\n\nGroup A: intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (Hyalone\u00ae). Single dose.\nGroup B: Low Dosage of MSCs . Intra-articular injection of 10 million autologous mesenchymal progenitor stem cells cultured ex - vivo (cell suspension sterile small volume (5-10 ml ) in a vehicle suitable for intraarticular injection ) followed by an intraarticular injection Hiaur\u00f3nico Acid ( Hyalone\u00ae).\nGroup C : High dose of MSCs. Intra-articular injection of 100 million autologous mesenchymal progenitor stem cells cultured ex - vivo ( cell suspension sterile small volume (5-10 ml ) in a vehicle suitable for intraarticular injection ) followed by an intraarticular injection Hiaur\u00f3nico Acid (Hyalone\u00ae).\n\nThe primary endpoint is safety and feasibility. The investigators registered the occurrence of complications and / or adverse effects during the study.\n\nIn addition the investigators assess the response to intra-articular infusion of CMM analyzing the following parameters:\n\nClinical assessment of pain and function (Baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months since treatment): VAS , WOMAC , KOOS , EuroQol, SF-16, Lequesne , WOMAC , KOOS.\nRadiographic (baseline, 6 and 12 months since treatment): Femorotibial space.\nRadiographic using MRI (baseline, 6 and 12 months since treatment): by assessing the number location of the lesions , cartilage thickness , signal intensity , subchondral bone alteration , volume and WORMS and dGEMRIC protocols."

                              "Stem cell transplantation has emerged as a relatively popular treatment that can help to regulate immunity, repair injury, and control inflammation. Several studies have used autologous stem cells or adipose-derived stem cells to treat Crohn's disease and its associated complications, and have achieved good efficacy. Thus far, the use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat Crohn's disease has rarely been reported. In this study, UC-MSCs were used to treat patients with hormone-controlled Crohn's disease. We observed the disease control conditions, corticosteroid dosage changes, and treatment-related adverse reactions."

With the advancement in transplantation protocols, acute survival of renal transplants has improved, but long-term survival is still unsatisfactory, as most of the renal transplants develop chronic graft rejection. Unfortunately, there is little the investigators know when it comes to improving long-term survival of renal transplants. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. The purpose of this study is to find out whether MSC in combination with standard therapy of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) are more effective in preventing organ deterioration and maintaining kidney function."

                              "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and is classified as acute (aGVHD) or chronic (cGVHD). aGVHD onsets within the first 100 days after transplant or with clinical features including erythema, liver dysfunction and oral mucositis, whilst cGVHD or persistent GVHD occurs in approximately 30-60% of transplant patients who survive their first year . Long-term five-year prognosis for cGVHD patients is poor with a 70% mortality rate. cGVHD manifests as an autoimmune-like disease affecting multiple sites, including skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and joints. The oral cavity is the second most common site to be affected with symptoms in 45-83% of cases. In the mouth a diverse spectrum of clinical features can be found for example mucosal lesions can affect almost any site, salivary gland dysfunction and restricted mouth opening. Short-term patients can experience mucosal sensitivity, malnutrition, problems speaking, increased caries risk, xerostomia, oral pain and a diminished quality-of-life. Long-term complications include secondary malignancies and perhaps early death. Clinical management seeks to alleviate the symptoms and improve quality-of-life but 50% of patients fail front-line systemic steroid therapy. Oral cGVHD can be treated with topical high potency corticosteroids and oral rinses, however these treatments are not always effective and carry a risk of systemic absorption. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) resident in adult and fetal tissues, such as the bone marrow have the capacity to form bone, cartilage, stroma, muscle and fat, are known to exhibit immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. MSC infusions have been used to treat disorders such as osteogenic imperfecta, cardiovascular disease and to heal large bony defects. Indeed, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs have led to infusions being used as a second-line treatment for GVHD patients, and our group has shown within a Phase II clinical trial, 55% aGVHD patients who failed front-line steroid treatment responded to MSC infusion these studies are going with cGVHD patients. The goal of this project is to perform a pilot study to determine whether MSC injections directly into mucosal lesions in patients with oral cGVHD are able to alleviate the symptoms and facilitate the reparative process."

                              "This study aims to evaluate bone formation in grafts in terms of its quality (density), quantity (volume) and maturation obtained with the application of a tissue-engineered bone grafting compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-culture medium (CM) and a synthetic bone substitute. The present study was designed as an experimental prospective split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics Committee, a total of 20 consecutive participants in need of maxillary reconstruction aiming implant-supported oral rehabilitation will be invited to join the study. To collect autogenous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs), an outpatient lipoplasty procedure at the abdominal area of each patient will be performed. To isolate and expand hASCs from the lipoaspirate, specific cell culture protocols will be followed, resulting in cultured viable cells and their conditioned medium (CM). Cells and CM will be then separated by a sequence of filters and centrifugation, and isolated CM will be frozen. ELISA will analyze the presence of chemokines and their concentration in CM before grafting. Following pre-op surgical planning, both maxillary sinuses of each patient will be grafted internally applying a lateral window to each sinus. The bony floor of the test maxillary sinus will be augmented with synthetic bone substitute (BoneCeramic\u2122 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM (test). The control site will receive bone substitute with saline. Lateral windows in both sinuses will be then closed with a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide\u2122). After 6 months, first-stage implant surgery will be performed placing 6 implants in each patient. Registration of implant stability by manual torque wrench will be performed. Also, bone biopsies from each drilled implant site will be collected for histology, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry (RT-PCR). Tomographic evaluation of the bone formation will include cone beam computed tomographies (CBCTs) at pre-operative [Baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2 = implant placement] days for bone 3D image analysis."

                              "Results from recent clinical trials on bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation show that this intervention can help reduce the incidence of heart failure (HF) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, no study has evaluated the effect of the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on a clinical endpoint such as HF.\n\nThis single-blinded, randomized, multicenter trial aims to establish whether the intracoronary infusion of umbilical cord-derived Wharton's jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) helps prevent HF development after AMI. The study will enroll 240 patients 3 to 7 days following an AMI treated with primary percutaenous coronary intervention (PPCI). Only patients aged below 65 years with impaired LV function (LVEF < 40%) will be included. They will be randomized to receive either a single intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or standard care. The primary outcome of this study is the assessment of HF development during long-term follow-up (four years). Since the efficacy of MSCs is higher than BM-MNCs after AMI in the improvement of LVEF, it would be probable that these cells may have a better clinical effect as well. However, no study has evaluated the impact of the transplantation of MSCs on a clinical endpoint such as HF. This study will help determine whether or not the infusion of intracoronary WJ-MSCs in patients"

The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third and sixth month after the fracture. First of all good surgical techniques are stable immobilization must be obtained and local sepsis excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Numerous techniques have been developed ranging from invasive interventions (including internal fixation with the use of bone graft or bone graft substitutes) to non invasive procedures (ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic fields).\n\nRecently, autologous cell therapy was presented as an interesting approach. The concept of such therapies is based on the effect of stem cells presented in the bone marrow and able to be transformed in osteoblast cells. The purpose of this study is to find if mesenchymal stem cells can stimulate bone regeneration in nonunion and delayed union fractures to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing."

It has become a urgent and serious public health event that threatens human life and health globally. Among them, severe pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus is characterized by extensive acute inflammation of the lungs and the patient is critically ill. At present, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.Most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV."

The prevalence of ED in DM varies around 35-85%. Recently, stem cell therapy has started to become the focus of experimental and clinical studies for the treatment of ED. Stem cells have been shown to be able to regenerate functionally damaged tissue, depending on the stimuli or signals received. Stem cells studies in experimental animals have been carried out using biomarker parameters, including VEGF, Bcl-2, E-selectin, cGMP, eNOS and have been shown to be successful in increasing cell survival and angiogenesis, stimulating antiapoptotic, proneurogenic, proinflammatory, and antifibrotic effects and improvements to these biomarker parameters. This study aims to determine the efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells as a therapy for ED due to type 2 diabetes in human."

The novelty of the current UMSC01 treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via IA and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion."

In addition, it has been shown that infusion of third party MSC in HSC transplantation could be successfully used as treatment for grade II-IV steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.\n\nOne hundred and twenty patients with HLA-mismatched donors will be included over 6 years at multiple centers across Belgium through the transplant committee of the Belgian Hematological Society. The conditioning regimen will consist of fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI, followed by the infusion of donor HSC. Patients will be randomized 1/1 in double-blind fashion to receive or not MSC (1.5-.3.0 x106/kg) from third-party (either haploidentical family members or unrelated volunteer) donors on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression will combine tacrolimus and MMF. Except for the collection, expansion and infusion of MSC, the clinical management of the patient will not differ from that of routine NM-HCT."

                              "Spina bifida, or myelomeningocele (MMC), is a disorder where the lower part of the spinal cord of the fetus is exposed, meaning there is no bone or skin covering it. This is dangerous because the spinal cord contains cells which control one's ability to move their legs and walk, and also to be able to urinate and have bowel movements normally. One of the current treatments for fetal MMC is to perform a surgery on the fetus before it is born which has many names including in utero surgery, prenatal surgery, or fetal surgery. This is a surgery that occurs inside the uterus (the womb) where the surgeon closes the opening in your fetus' back to cover the exposed spinal cord.\n\nResearchers have found that adding stem cells to the repair is effective in improving the ability of animals with MMC to walk, and that the stem cells are safe in animal studies. These stem cells are thought to protect the cells in the spinal cord that control movement and developmental outcomes. This study is being performed to look at the safety and effectiveness of stem cells on the fetus's exposed spinal cord during prenatal surgery."

                              "Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is a serious public health problem in the world, it carries a high personal, social and economic impact. Currently, there are no drugs that modify the natural course of the disease. As analgesic therapy becomes insufficient, more invasive measures are applied, ultimately leading to arthroplasty.\n\nThe scientific community has joined efforts to develop new therapeutic approaches that allow the delay and regeneration of injured tissue in these patients. These include cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources. Although most of the clinical studies carried out in different parts of the world with this therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis have shown therapeutic benefit, it is necessary to develop clinical trials with high quality in our population.\n\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Cellistem-OA (biological therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord) in patients with knee osteoarthritis in the Colombian population.\n\nInvestigators proposed to carry out an experimental (clinical trial), randomized, controlled and parallel with 30 participants with knee knee osteoarthritis of the medical complex Fundaci\u00f3n Oftalmol\u00f3gica de Santander Cl\u00ednica Carlos Ardila Lulle. The participants will be randomized into two groups: i) 15 patients who will receive a dose of 2 x 106 Cellistem-OA and ii) 15 patients who will receive an active comparator (acetonide of triamcinolone 10mg / mL), which will be administered by intra-articular injection in the superolateral aspect of the knee. The outcomes to be evaluated will be: (i) decrease in joint pain, (ii) increase in joint functionality, (iii) improvement in quality of life and (iv) improvement of articular cartilage. These parameters will be evaluated at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 25, 28, 32, 36 and 52 post-treatments. Additionally, local and systemic adverse events will be recorded to establish whether or not there is an association between them and the intervention."

Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Besides, regulatory T cells(Tregs) had been proved as an immune regualtory T cell subsets, which could reduce immune cell activation and reduce liver injury severity. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis."

                              "Now it is commonly accepted that MSC produce an immune-tolerant environment in different settings. It has been shown (mainly for BM-MSC) that MSC can down-regulate T cells activation. This characteristic of BM derived MSC already has clinical implications and shows their potent effectiveness both in prophylaxis and treatment of resistant GvHD. Ongoing clinical trials of use bone marrow MSC for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD are successfully run on and some bone marrow donor registries included BM-MSC as a material for donation. According to our preclinical studies MSC from cells from marrow, placenta, umbilical cord vessels demonstrate similar pronounced immunosuppressive effect both with autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes. Our preliminary clinical experience shows that BM-MSC is an effective tool for treatment of steroid resistant GVHD. Present study aimed to demonstrate if human UC-MSC has in vivo immunosuppressive effect and can be used for GVHD treatment"

                              "Background:\n\n- Sometimes after stem cells are transplanted, donor cells attack the recipient s cells and cause tissue damage. This is called acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Researchers want to see if bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) can help treat GVHD. BMSC can travel in the body and help repair tissue. The BMSC in this study were grown from bone marrow from healthy volunteers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test whether BMSC are safe to use soon after GVHD is diagnosed and to see how the body s immune system responds to BMSC.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- People over 4 years old who had a stem cell transplant at NIH and now have acute GVHD. People who have had certain previous immunosuppressive therapy may be ineligible.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They will have a GVHD exam, including skin and stool tests. They must have a functioning central line.\nParticipation will last 11 weeks: 4 8 weeks of cell infusions, then follow-up for the rest of the weeks.\nUp to 12 cell infusions:\nParticipants will come to the clinic twice weekly.\nThey will get medicine to prevent side effects (like Tylenol and Benadryl).\nBMSC will be given through a small plastic tube in an arm vein or through an IV catheter. It will last 20 60 minutes.\nParticipants will be monitored for 1 hour.\nFollow-up visits: Up to twice a week, participants will have physical exam and blood tests. They may have a GVHD exam.\nParticipants who have a tissue biopsy outside the study will be asked to send a sample to the study."

Chronic liver disease in Egypt is recognized as a serious health problem affecting greater than (20 %) of the population, where the main cause is chronic infection.\n\nLiver transplantation is still the standard treatment for advanced decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, this treatment is quite limited in clinical practice. Therefore there is a concerted effort around the world to develop regenerative and alternative therapies, so, stem cell-based therapies are emerging as new alternatives to liver transplantation for end-stage liver pathologies."

Non-wearing parts of cartilage tissues were harvested from one osteoarthritic patient during the total knee arthroplasty surgery. Cartilage fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice.\n\nMoreover, the investigators will collect the discard cartilage to develop an acellular cartilage ECM-derived scaffold in the joint replacement surgery. In addition, the investigators will harvest the redundant bone marrow from drilling or useless synovium during the surgery to separate the mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, these mesenchymal stem cells will be transfected with hTERT for rejuvenation and then will be labeled with fluorescent dye PKH26 for application of animal study. To sum up, the investigators plan to use human, natural, and discard materials from the joint replacement surgery to develop appropriate allograft for cartilage repair and hope that one day this ideal would be apply in clinical."

Liver failure inpatients caused by hepatitis B were recruited and received the same medical treatments, among whom some patients underwent single transplantation with autologous MMSCs and other patients with matched age, gender and biochemical indexes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), prothrombin time (PT) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) ] were in control group. A total of 120 ml bone marrow were obtained from patients, diluted and separated. Then MMSCs suspension were slowly transfused into the liver through the proper hepatic artery by interventional procedures. The levels of ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD score of patients in translation group were compared with those in control group. In 3 ~ 48 months of follow-up, differences in long-term outcomes such as incidence of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and mortality between two groups were compared."

                              "Musculoskeletal conditions are common sources of pain. Specifically, osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations)."

A pair uremia patients receiving kidney grafts from a same donor are randomized into two groups: MSCs group and control group. Besides routine induction therapy (ATG or Basiliximab) and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs (low-dose Tacrolimus + MPA + prednisone), patients in MSCs group are administered MSCs treatment (1*10^6/kg). Allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are given intravenously at day 0 (post renal reperfusion during surgery), day 7, day 14 and day 21. The renal allograft function, rejection, patient/graft survival and severe adverse events within 12 months post-transplant are monitored."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "Failure rates of up to 30% are reported after proximal humeral fractures despite angular-stable devices. This may devastate not only the functional outcome but also the independence of elderly patients.\n\nTo increase bone mineral density and thereby holding-strength augmentation is an option. Autologous bone-graft, as current gold-standard, though is questionable in osteoporosis since osteoprogenitors are dysfunctional and the harvesting-morbidity considerable. Adipose tissue seems an alternative cell-source even in presence of osteoporosis.\n\nStromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from lipoaspirates display osteogenic and vasculogenic potential and can be harvested in high numbers. Expansion associated with costly good-manufacturers-practice facilities is avoidable, so are repeated interventions. These cells have been successfully used to generate osteogenic composite grafts with intrinsic vascularity in preclinical models.\n\nFor translation into clinical practice after a 20 patient external pilot a prospective randomized controlled trial with 270 patients is planned. For the trial lipoaspiration precedes open reduction and internal fixation in individuals over 60 years presenting with a proximal humeral fracture after low-energy trauma. Cells are isolated (Cellution\u00ae800/CRS) and wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules after embedding in a fibrin-gel for augmentation of the typical bone-void. Clinical/radiological follow-up is at 6 and 12 weeks for immediate complications and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Functional assessment is performed after 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months using the Quick-Dash- and Constant-Score.\n\nThe primary outcome is a reduction in secondary dislocation by 50% during the first postoperative year. Secondary dislocation is diagnosed on plain radiographs by an independent board certified radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal imaging if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\nMore than 20\u00b0 varus collapse of the humeral head fragment in relation to the humeral shaft\nScrew penetration through the humeral head"

MSCs in the blood will then be quantitated and identified using according to unique proteins found on their cell surface using flow cytometry. The results of flow cytometry analysis will then be compared to the patients characteristics (age, sex, race, etc.), their past medical history (hx of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) and to the patient outcome (length of hospital stay, mortality, etc.)."

Any knee joint trauma or the progression of osteoarthritis may lead to the progression of cartilage or osteochondral defects. Compared with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), peripheral blood MSCs have better chondrogenic differentiation ability. At the same time, the mobilization of peripheral blood MSCs and the advancement of extraction technology also make it feasible to treat osteochondral damage by using peripheral blood MSCs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of surgical transplantation of autologous peripheral blood MSCs to repair knee joint \u2163-degree localized cartilage injury, and to explore a new treatment for osteochondral defects based on the foundation of the research group's previous research."

                              "MSCs have been studied for the treatment of liver diseases as well as non-liver diseases. MSCs have been successful in treating conditions like acute steroid-resistant GVHD in hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients and also have shown to improve the MELD score in end-stage liver disease. There were no severe side effects observed in using autologous MSCs as a treatment option. The outcome of the studies done so far have been positive and it is encouraged to study the use of MSCs as cell therapy for treating liver diseases.\n\nThe estimated rate of cirrhosis in HBV patients in Singapore is about 1.6% per year, rate of hepatocellular carcinoma is about 0.8% per year overall and 3.0% per year in cirrhotic patients. Knowing that there are not many options currently available for Liver Cirrhosis patients and that they have a poor prognosis with an average life expectancy of < 12 months, this study uses autologous MSCs to treat Liver Cirrhosis patients in Singapore. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that autologous bone marrow is safe to be used in patients with liver cirrhosis as well as demonstrate that bone marrow MSC may improve liver function and prolong patient survival."

Based on extensive preclinical investigations, the technology of using freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells mixed with proteins seems safe and most effective for a one-step correction of cartilage defect and restoration of the osteochondral complex, because the same mixture can generate cartilage in the vasculature-free knee joint, and bone in the environment of bone defects."

Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires.\n\nMSC obtained from each patient's bone marrow will be isolated and expanded \"Ex-Vivo\" under GMP conditions at Xcelia-Divisi\u00f3n de Terapias avanzadas del Banc de Sang I Teixits. After 21 days, patients will be implanted a single-dose of approximately 40 millions of autologous MSC in the knee by articular injection, and followed up for 12 month. Articular cartilage changes will be determined by T2-weighted MRI (Cartigram) at 6 and 12 month. Clinical assessment will measure the pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS), the self-reported functional status by Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the quality of life by Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) at 3, 6 and 12 month.\n\nThe working hypothesis proposes that the expected regenerative articular cartilage effect of the MSC will be produced to a measurable degree by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires."

                              "Stem cells (SC) are the foundation cells for every organ, tissue and cell in the body. They are undifferentiated \"blank\" cells that do not yet have a specific function. Under proper conditions, they begin to develop into specialized tissue and organs. They are self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. They serves as a sort of repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish other cells as long as the person is still alive. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility and elevated serum gonadotropins. POF occurs in 1 % of women. In majority of cases the underlying cause is not identified. Management essentially involves hormone replacement and infertility treatment. This work aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous MSC transplantation in women suffering from Premature Ovarian Failure."

                              "Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mediated by stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) which leads to donor T-lymphocytes activation and target tissue destruction, particularly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver in acute setting. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.\n\nObjective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics\u00ae umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.\n\nStudy design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.\n\nFor Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20 patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.\n\nCyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires."

Its main clinical manifestations are chronic cholestatic lesions and is deemed as autoimmune liver disease. PSC are immune abnormalities that occurs in patients with genetic susceptibility. No other pathogenesis is revealed yet. Ursodeoxycholic acid is used as an empirical treatment, and there is no approved drug or a acceptable treatment regimen. The disease often progresses to liver decompensation and requires liver transplantation. In recent years, the clinical application of stem cell therapy has seen many important advances. Stem cells are characterized with properties of multiple differentiation, repair of damaged tissue and immuno-modulation. This study aims to employ UCMSCs to treat PSC patients and observe its efficacy and safety, and to explore the possible therapeutic mechanisms."

The patients are operated with phonomicrosurgical dissection of the scarred vocal folds, removal or scar tissue and injection of autologous mesenchymal stroma cells, aMSC (which were previously harvested from each patients\u00b4s bone marrow, purified, expanded and characterized according to standard procedure at the Center of Hematology and Regenerative Medicine Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge). 8 Patients is planned to be treated with a single injection of aMSC and 8 patients with injection of aMSC mixed with a carrier hyaluronan gel developed at Uppsala University Sweden and at the Karolinska Institute. The laryngeal status, vocal fold function, and voice function will be followed individually with an advanced battery of examinations performed before and up to 1 year postoperatively. Side effects and complications are noted and reported during surgery and following surgery at regular intervals during at least 1 year Since spring 2015 no new patients have been recruited and no treatments are given during 2016 or 2017. The monitoring authority was changed from Swedish National Board of Health to Swedish Medical Product Agency (MPA) in March/April 2016.

                              "The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, especially the critically ill cases. The significant clinical outcome and well tolerance was observed by the adoptive transfer of allogenic MSCs. We proposed that the adoptive transfer therapy of MSCs might be an ideal choice to be used. We expect to provide new options for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients and contribute to improving the quality of life of critically ill patients."

The ability of MSCs to differentiate into oocyte-like cells has been previously documented.

Mesenchymal stem cells are able to produce growth factors that provide support to diseased nervous cells.\n\nIn this study mesenchymal stem cells will be harvested from the bone marrow, cultivated in a test tube so that they multiply and then infused into the arteries that supply blood to the brain in 20 patients suffering from a rare form of parkinsonism, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Each patient will undergo two infusions, one with the stem cells and one without, at an interval of 6 months. The sequence of the two infusions will be assigned randomly; patients and assessors will not know the sequence (double-blind). Patients will be followed-up for up to 1 year after the last infusion, with regular assessments to assess safety, efficacy on motor and cognitive functions, and effects on the brain by neuroimaging techniques.\n\nThe study has a preliminary phase with 5 patients all given stem cell therapy alone, designed to assess safety"

                              "Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in diagnosis, the quest for the development of a disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. Human cartilage only has limited regenerative potential. Transplantation is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity of MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells - chondrocytes. The acquisition of MSC does not require invasive surgical intervention or cartilage extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based strategies. The investigators inject allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells to the cartilage lesions in patients via intra-articular injection method, and to investigate the efficacy and safety."

As a novel technique, stem cell transplantation provides a new option for patients with DPN. In 2012, Wuhan Central Hospital, took the lead in carrying out clinical research on the treatment of DPN with autologous bone marrow stem cells in China, and patients were significantly relieved. Based on this research, our clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN."

It has important physical and psychological consequences/impact in those patients.\n\nPremature ovarian failure (POF) is currently managed by non-physiological sex steroid regimens which are inadequate at optimizing uterine characteristics.\n\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and human cord blood mononuclear cells (hCBMNCs) have been shown to have the ability to modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising therapeutic strategy for POF.\n\nIn this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCMSCs and hCBMNCs transplantation combined with Hormone Replacement Therapy will be evaluated in patients with Premature Ovarian Failure. Participants will be followed for an expected average of 48 weeks."

                              "The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in the Western World, including Denmark. Cancer of the head and neck and its treatment often have a detrimental and lifelong impact on the quality of life of the patients. Radiotherapy is a key component for approximately 80% of all patients with head and neck cancer and despite the enormous improvement in ionizing radiotherapy, the radiation still leads to significant ionizing of healthy tissue, including the radiation-sensitive salivary glands. Salivary glands suffer severe damage from radiation, and as these cells are the principal sites of fluid secretion one of the most prevalent side effect of irradiation for head and neck cancer is hyposalivation and dry mouth syndrome, xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to debilitating oral disorders and major implication for the overall quality of life, including social life and professional life. Currently, only symptomatic treatment is available to patients suffering from xerostomia, and therefore there is an immense, unmet need for new treatment strategies for hyposalivation and xerostomia.\n\nStem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types, and stem cells have been suggested as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of stem cells from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life."

Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently."

                              "The morbidity of spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing significantly in China. The methods to treat SCI patients in sequela stage update are poor. Though traditional rehabilitation therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, its effect to improve the neurological disorders of these patients, such as the dysfunction of sense, motor, autologous adjustment of blood pressure control of urination and defecation, perspiration , etc. is unsatisfying. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function. Studies show that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can remarkably improve the neurological function of SCI in animals without any severe side effect.\n\nIn this study, the investigators use mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord to treat 40 SCI patients (20 cases in early stage and 20 cases in sequela stage). The investigators also follow-up ten patients who only receive rehabilitation and another ten outpatients who accept neither stem cell therapy nor rehabilitation. On this basis, the investigators can compare the efficacy of these two treatments."

On this basis, the investigators can compare the efficacy of these two treatments."

The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. Particularly, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) has been demonstrated to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the investigators propose a hypothesis that umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can also improve the disease conditions of LC patients, particularly reducing the decompensated conditions in these patients."

Pre-clinical sepsis studies suggest that mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells may modulate inflammation, enhance pathogen clearance and tissue repair and reduce death. Our team has completed a Phase I dose escalation and safety clinical trial that evaluated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients with septic shock. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial established that MSCs appear safe and that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is feasible. Based on these data, the investigators have planned a phase II RCT (CISS2) at several Canadian academic centres which will evaluate safety, signals for clinical efficacy, and continue to examine potential mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock."

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment for that. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organs. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. In the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented. We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of healthy volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes, and the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."

Several mechanisms have been incriminated in the pathophysiology of ICU-AW, but muscle regeneration has not been well investigated in this context, even though its involvement is suggested by the protracted functional consequences of ICU-AW. Recent data suggest that muscle regeneration could be impaired after sepsis, and that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) treatment could improve the post-injury muscle recovery."

                              "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the treatment for many malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a serious life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. The outcome for patients with aGVHD is poor and overall survival is low. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as the major complication of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT), limits the application of this curative therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells, which are able to modulate immune response in vitro and in vivo, and have possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as aGVHD. MSCs obtained from umbilical cord (UC) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. In addition, UC-derived MSCs can be used for off-the-shelf use and are obtained without any harm to donors than bone marrow-MSCs. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs in patients with aGVHD."

                              "Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by a series of time-dependent events orchestrated by the innate immune system. This begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense sterile inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes including monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI. There is increasing evidence to suggest inflammation is not limited to the infarcted myocardium and systemic imbalances in the post-infarct inflammatory cascade can exacerbate adverse remodelling beyond the infarct site. Therefore, it is very important that therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and antiinflammatory pathways timely after AMI. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been shown to exhibit immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and paracrine secretion of bioactive factors that can attenuate inflammation and promote tissue regeneration, making them a promising cell source for AMI therapy. However, it has been proved in our and other studies that perfusion of WJMSCs after 5 days of AMI can only slightly improve left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is the most important indicator of left ventricular remodeling. Thus, WANIAMI Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase#study designed to assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of WJMSCs in the treatment of patients in the acute phase ( within 24h) with the both of ST-Segment-Elevation or Non-ST-Segment-Elevation AMI."

Combining the self-renewal potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an epigenome editing approach as therapeutic strategy to rescue the activity of MLL4 will be developed.\n\nA step forward is expected towards the understanding of those the molecular mechanisms governing the aetiology of Kabuki Syndrome (KS) and that the proposed in vitro disease model will provide to the scientific community an experimental system to study the KS. Importantly, the aim is to define the molecular bases of KS and to develop a therapeutic strategy that could ameliorate some of the abnormalities associated with KS."

                              "RATIONALE: It has been shown that about 30% of patients do not respond to immunosuppressive therapy or experience recurrence, and graft rejection and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) decrease event-free survival to 30% to 50% in the alternative donor (matched unrelated, partially matched family member) transplantation. Although an overall and disease free survival of 85% to 100%, can be obtained in allogeneic blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation using an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor, only about 25% of patients have such a donor.\n\nPURPOSE: In an attempt to avoid GVHD, reduce earlier infection rate and decrease regimen-related toxicity while maintaining better engraftment, this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient's own adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) or AD-MSC transdifferentiated HSC (AD-HSC) transplant after an immunosuppressive regimen in treating patients who have severe aplastic anemia.\n\nThe patient will be in the study for one year for observation and active monitoring. After treatment and active monitoring are over, the patient's medical condition will be followed indefinitely. The principle measures of safety and efficacy will be :\n\nPatient survival probability at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.\nEngraftment at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year\nIncidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and Incidence of earlier infection rate as well as other complications within 6 months and 1 years."

                              "Actively developing stem cells (SCs) transplantation techniques cause natural interest to the problem of regeneration in the lungs. Numerous experimental studies proved the benefits of different types of SCs in experimental models of pulmonary emphysema (PE).\n\nG. Zhen et al. have shown that the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rats with papain-induced emphysema leads to their migration into the lungs, differentiation into type 2 alveolocytes, and inhibition of apoptosis and prevention PE.\n\nK. Schweitzer et al. have proved the activity of inflammation in the airways, alveolocytes and endothelial cells apoptosis decreased after adipose SCs intravenous administration to mice with emphysema caused by chronic exposure to tobacco smoke or VEGF receptors blockade. The study of E.P. Ingenito et al. found that endobronchial installed MSCs engraft into the alveolar wall and peribronchial interstitium and release integrins, extracellular matrix components (collagen IV, laminin and fibrillin), platelet-derived growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor \u03b22.\n\nOur study also found reliable deterrent effect of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs on the development of elastase-induced emphysema in rats at different terms of transplantation.\n\nAfter the success of pilot studies have started clinical trials. Currently, the website http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov reported three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in patients with COPD and emphysema. Two of them have already been completed and the results of the first pilot project published.\n\nAuthors on the example of 4 patients showed a complete absence of adverse effects, improved quality of life and stability of functional parameters at 12 months after starting treatment One of the problems of MSC transplantation in patients with respiratory failure is an accelerated apoptosis of transplanted cells under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Since it is proved that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxia increases their survival in hypoxic conditions, increases the expression of growth factors and antiinflammatory cytokines, we suppose that MSCs grown in hypoxic medium may have a significant positive effect on the disease."

The 100 study subjects who have previously banked their AdMSCs with Celltex, will receive three doses of autologous AdMSCs (approximately 200 million cells) intravenous infusion every three days. The 100 subjects in the control group who have previously banked their AdMSCs with Celltex will not receive any Celltex's AdMSC therapy but placebo treatments. All subjects are monitored for safety (adverse events/severe adverse events), COVID-19 symptoms, SARS-Cov-2 virus test, blood SARS-Cov-2 IgM and IgG antibodies tests, blood cytokine and inflammatory (CRP, IL_6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1) tests and disease severity evaluation for 6 months after the last dose of AdMSC infusion for the study group and 6 months after the enrollment for the control group."

                              "Cell therapy appears to be an alternative to treat bone defects. Scientific advances have shown in animal models and in humans that mesenchymal stem cells were good candidates to support cellular bone regeneration after transplantation. However, their collection requires invasive sampling usually bone marrow. A new candidate stem cells able to stimulate bone regeneration has recently been identified in the nasal cavity, these cells are called \"ecto-mesenchymal\" cells. These stem cells have very similar biological characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow. They exhibit a high mitogenic activity and hold great potential for differentiation into osteoblast lineage. Given their properties and their ease of access within the nasal cavity, ecto-mesenchymal stem cells offer new prospects for cell therapy targeting bone involvement. In this context, the ecto-mesenchymal stem cells represent a nasal bone reconstruction interesting alternative in particular in indication of the cleft. They are directly and easily accessible in these children when conventional surgical reconstruction. The investigators propose in this study to validate a production method of stem cell called \"ecto-mesenchymal\" isolated from a biopsy of the nasal cavity of children with cleft lip and palate to be able to soon propose cell therapy innovative in this indication."

Patients with spine problems often need surgeries that include fusion (bony healing) of vertebrae (bones in your back) together in order to hold the bones steady allowing them to heal together (fusion). If the vertebrae (back bones) fail to heal together, which occurs about 10-15% of the time, it can result in a slower recovery and may require revision (another) surgery. By using a small portion of the graft taken during surgery the investigators hope to define the cells that make bone most efficiently. This will help reduce the need for revision surgeries and improve patient recovery."

The possible postulation for this is possibly because when using autologous CD34+ cell infusion, the inflammatory milieu of the liver may not be conducive for sustained effects of the mobilized CD 34+ cells. MSC have immunomodulatory effect (ref) and may improve the liver environment making it more beneficial for the CD34+ cells to function and survive. In addition, MSC has ben shown to produce hepatocyte growth factor which is protective against liver injury and beneficial for liver regeneration (shown in above tables). However, it remains to be understood how MSCs promote liver stem stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes or expand the residual hepatocyte population. MSC can also directly inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, the main source of extracellular matrix via MSC derived IL 10 and TNF-\u03b1and may also induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis. Current lacunae in cell based therapy is based on the poor consensus and understanding on the best type of cells to be used, the ideal number of cells, the most appropriate route of administration and the need for repeat dosing . The concept that combination of autologous hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be more beneficial than infusing any one of them alone has been discussed in many scientific forums but there are no study till date to either see the safety as well as the efficacy of this proof of concept .\n\nWith this above background data, we propose a study design which will be a safety study for combination use of autologous CD34+ and MSC"

Mesenchymal stem cells are undifferentiated cells which can undergo self-renewal & differentiation into other cell types like muscle cells; thus can be used to regenerate the damaged sphincter muscles. In this study mesenchymal stem cells will be obtained from bone marrow from the patient, processed, & then re-injected periurethrally. Effectiveness will be compared to that of the surgical treatment (tension-free vaginal tape)."

                              "The axons of the retinal ganglion cells combine to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits electrical signals to the visual cortex by various synapses. Optic nerve axons are more sensitive to toxins than retina because they are outside the blood retinal barrier. Methanol, various solvents and heavy metals, carbon dioxide, antiarrhythmic, antiepileptic, antibiotics and some vasoactive drugs can cause toxic optic neuropathy. There is a different pathophysiology for each toxin. Methanol is easily accessible alcohol in all types of disinfectants. Methanol is converted into formaldehyde and formic acid while metabolized in the liver. Formaldehyde disrupts ATP synthesis by blocking mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. Formic acid causes demyelination as a result of metabolic acidosis. Neuroinflammation occurs when denatured proteins block axoplasmic flow. All these processes can lead to apoptosis and permanent vision loss. Sildenafil is a vasoactive drug used in erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil decreases optic nerve head blood flow. Neuroinflammation develops secondary to the cessation of axoplasmic flow after hypoxia. If hypoxia and neuroinflammatiom persists, apoptosis and permanent vision loss develop. Amiodarone is an ion channel blocker used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Long-term use may cause disruption of ion channel balance in the optic nerve. This condition leads to asymmetric neuroinflammation and apoptosis.\n\nWharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) can increase mitochondrial ATP synthesis with paracrine effects and suppress neuroinflammation with immunomodulatory effects. Repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rEMS) can rearrange ion channel balances and axoplasmic flow. The aim of this prospective phase-3 clinical study is to investigate the effect of WJ-MSC and rEMS combination in the therapy of toxic optic neuropathies. This combination is the first study in the literature for the therapy of toxic optic neuropathies."

Patients in control group are prescribed to current desensitization therapy including at least one of the following treatments: plasmapheresis (PP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab or Bortezomib, depending on individual pathological and immunological features (eg. DSA type and titer) of each study subjects. Patients in MSCs group receive additional BM-MSCs therapy besides desensitization treatments as in control group. Allogeneic BM-MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are intravenously administered every two weeks for four consecutive doses. All cAMR patients are followed up for one year. Renal function, DSA level, pathological features, patient/graft survival, and severe adverse events are monitored during the follow-up period.

                              "Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing. The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.\n\nIn addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.\n\nMSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19 Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective.\n\nThe current Phase I/II study of adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal stem cells is conducted with the broad objective of establishing safety and efficacy."

Subjects who meet the final inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomized to the test groups (low-dose group and high-dose group) or control group (placebo group) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Subjects assigned to the test groups were administered intravenously once with 5 x 10^7cells of DW-MSC for the low-dose group or 1 x 10^8cells for the high-dose group after registration. Subjects assigned to the control group were administered with placebo in the same manner as the test drug (DW-MSC). At this time, all of the existing standard co-treatment are allowed. DW-MSC is adjunct therapy to standard therapy.\n\nThis clinical trial is a double-blind trial, in which a randomized method will be used. To maintain the double-blindness of the study, statistician who do not participate in this study independently generate randomization code. Subjects will be randomized to the test groups (low-dose group and high-dose group) or the control group (placebo group) in a 1:1:1 ratio. After the completion of the trial, the randomization code will be disclosed after unlocking the database and unblinding procedures.

                              "HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency. A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However, it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to immune reconstitution in chronic HIV infection. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated to decrease immune responses of the host, and can suppress inflammation in HIV-infected non-responders. Here, the investigators propose a hypothesis that MSC can reduce immune activation which subsequently lead to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts dependent on dose of transfused MSCs in HIV-infected patients."

The investigators' selected model of research is based on maximizing the efficiency of the approach by choosing an autologous pattern which preserves the genetic make-up of an individual that is vital in infertility conditions. Additionally the approach involves injecting a combination of different but purified cell types which all aid in the retrieval of spermatogenesis, and the generation of mature spermatozoa. Expected outcomes of this study are defined in general improvements in infertile patients in regards of testicular morphology, sexual function, semen quality, development of primary or secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, or mature spermatozoa in the testis, seminiferous tubules, or semen."

                              "Limb-length discrepancy can be due to many causes. These are divided into three groups: congenital (from birth), developmental (from a childhood disease or injury that slows or damages the growth plates), and posttraumatic (from a fracture that leads to shortening of the bone ends). There are three ways to equalize the limb-length discrepancy: use a shoe lift, shorten the long leg, lengthen the short leg. Most patients do not like wearing a lift greater than 2 cm (3/4 in). For discrepancies greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm (2 in), shortening of the long leg can be considered, especially for tall persons. For growing children, this can be easily accomplished with a small, minimally invasive, uncomplicated procedure called epiphysiodesis.The investigators aim to evaluate if injection of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells can shorten the treatment period by acceleration of bone regeneration during distraction osteogenesis."

The literature search does not show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new material i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the addition of a patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this seems to be an additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human mandibular periodontal intraosseous defects."

The ready access of SF MSC to cartilage and other joint tissues offers a novel strategy for joint repair. Current arthroscopic procedures result in the removal of all SF MSCs due to continuous irrigation throughout the procedure. The current study would benefit the patient by greatly increasing the reparative capacity of the joint by bolstering MSC numbers and retaining those MSCs within the joint after surgery. By accessing MSCs from the synovium it is anticipated that these cells would be entrapped/migrate into the marrow clot formed by microfracture of the sub-chondral bone. These MSCs would supplement those from the marrow and may result in faster, better quality repair."

Using the potential features of MSCs in the treatment of fibrosis may offer new insights into reconstruction the damaged tissues. The project intends to transplant autologous MSCs to ten peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra-filtration failure. It's going to study infusion effects in clinical, cellular and molecular levels.\n\nSo in this trial, we will evaluate the effects of this intervention after intravenous injection of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in 10 peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra filtration failure (UFF). Fifteen UFF patients are also considered as the control group. Then they will be followed 20, 45 and 90 days, and also 4 and 6 months after first injection."

                              "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common hereditary retinal disorder (accounts for 20% of children attending blind schools in Pakistan) which causes degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. Rods and cones largely depend on the retinal pigment epithelium for their proper functioning. Various growth factors and their receptors are present in retinal epithelium and a number of genes are responsible for the production of these growth factors. Genetic mutation in any of these genes causes retinal degeneration by progressive loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. The disease initially starts with night blindness and leads to the loss of central vision and eventually total blindness. To date, there is no definitive cure for patients suffering from RP. Recently, stem cell based therapies have shown great promise for the management of RP. It is well documented that umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have the ability to release various paracrine and immunomodulatory factors that are similar to those synthesized by retinal pigment epithelium. Multiple routes including systemic (intravenous) and localized (subretinal, intravitreal, suprachoroidal and sub-tenon) have been employed to administer UMSCs for the management of RP. It is important to note that deep sub-tenon region (space between the sclera and the conjunctiva) acts as both natural culture medium for cells and as immune privileged site because of avascularity of the region. It has been reported that the injection of UMSCs in sub-tenon space of human subjects have improved the visual acuity even after 1 year post-injection. In addition, the injection of UMSCs in suprachoroidal space enhances the entry of growth factors released by the cells into choroidal flow and maintain the constant growth factors secretion to the choroidal and retinal tissues. Limoli and colleagues were the first to report the suprachoroidal administration of cells being the safe mode of cell delivery with no complications. The present study is aimed to investigate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of UMSC injection employing two different routes (sub-tenon injection versus suprachoroidal injection) for the treatment of RP in human subjects."

                              "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease that causes substantial loss of intrahepatic bile ducts, ultimately resulting in cholestasis, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Histologically, the disease is characterized by chronic portal inflammation with infiltration, destruction and loss of the epithelial cells in the small-sized and medium-sized bile ducts. Currently, Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13-15mg/kg/day is recommended as therapeutic drugs for PBC by AASLD and is approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with UDCA may delay disease progression and prolong survival free of liver transplantation. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both. UC-MSC has been application for the treatment of several severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for PBC patients will be evaluated."

                              "In COVID-19 infection caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a dysregulation of the immune system response that causes cytokine storm syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 works like a hijacker (hackers), sabotaging communication between cells so that the immune system, like T-cells, kills not only infected cells but also healthy cells. This dysregulation results in hyper-inflammation which cause damage to organs, not just the lungs. This is the cause of the high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.\n\nExosomes are vesicles with a size of 30-100 nanometers originating from within cells that function to communicate with other cells. Exosomes are transport containers that contain bioactive cargo: such as proteins, genetic material, and various other molecules. These containers move from cells of origin, flowing through blood vessels or other body fluids to target cells. Exosomes penetrate the cell membrane and act on various organelles within the target cell.\n\nAll cell types can produce exosomes. What differentiates them is the cargo they contain. The exosome produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contains bioactive cargo derived from mesenchymal stem cells, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, messengerRNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). The target cells are immune system cells, infected cells and progenitor cells from infected organs. On target immune cells, the anti-inflammatory cytokines work as immunomodulators to relieve hyper-inflammation. In infected cells, the miRNAs work to prevent viral replication by inhibiting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA (viral mRNA silencing and degrading). In lung progenitor cells and other infected organs, the growth factors work to stimulate protein synthesis processes that function for organ regeneration.\n\nThis study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) clinical trial with two arms: one intervention arm, and one control arm. The EXOSOME-MSC will be tested as adjuvant, on top of standard COVID-19 drugs. It will be injected to participants via intravenous route twice, in day-1 and day-7 of 14 days of study participation."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nNon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

Donor MSCs can serve as a source of recovery for niches in patients with graft failure (GF) after allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation. Since only few MSCs reach the BM after intravenous injection, MSCs were implanted into the iliac spine. Preliminary results suggest that MSCs participate in the restoration of niches for donor hematopoietic cells or have an immunomodulatory effect, preventing repeated rejection of the graft. Perhaps intraosseous implantation of MSCs contributes to the success of the second transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells and patient survival."

                              "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the liver, interface hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and the presence of autoantibodies. Disease presentation is varied but typically is based on characteristic aminotransferase elevations, histological abnormalities, elevated levels of serum globulins, and the presence of one or more autoantibodies. Two types of juvenile AIH have been identified according to seropositivity for smooth muscle and /or antinuclear antibody (AIH type 1) or liver kidney microsomal antibody (AIH type 2). Standard therapy in clinic consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which displays the efficacy in 80% of patients. However, 7% of patients deteriorate despite compliance with the standard corticosteroid regiments (treatment failure),13% of patients improve but not to a degree that satisfies remission criteria (incomplete response), 13% of patients develop serious drug-induced complications, and 50%-86% of patients will relapse after drug withdrawal. These serious drawbacks counterbalance the benefits of conventional therapy, and they are compelling reasons to refine current treatment strategies and pursue alternative therapies. UC-MSC has been the application for the treatment of several severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for AIH patients will be evaluated."

Qualified subjects after the screening will be divided into low, medium, or high dose groups to receive a single intravenous infusion of BX-U001 at the dose of 0.5\u00d710^6, 1.0\u00d710^6, or 1.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg of body weight, respectively.

                              "Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related pneumonia, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Investigators have seen recently from experience in Western countries with best health care systems that pandemics cannot be managed in hospitals. Investigators have seen ICUs crowded to capacity, healthcare workers being exposed and going to quarantine or dying after exposure to large doses of viral inoculums. Investigators recommend that institutions should register for Clinical trials and consider emergency use of TPE. In Pandemics, time is of essence to avoid mortality by intervening early with available evidence, preferably as part of clinical trial.Since the outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19), main treatment modalities have been antivirals, interferons, glucocorticoids, anti-coagulants and supportive treatment in addition to traditional Chinese medicine. There are also clinical trials exploring hydroxyquinoline / chloroquine sulphate, azithromycin, immunoglobulins, Vitamin-C, washed microbiota, nebulized interferon, teicoplanin as well as Mesenchymal stem cells. However, most of these trials were small and remain in the experimental phase with currently no effective / speci\ufb01c antiviral with robust scientific evidence as regards the mortality reduction in COVID-19.In an attempt to treat COVID-19, investigator will use different investigational treatment either alone or in combination to see mortality and morbidity benefit on the basis of limitted evidence available so far. These investigational modalities include Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), Convalescent Plasma (CP), Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in addition to standard supportive treatment."
