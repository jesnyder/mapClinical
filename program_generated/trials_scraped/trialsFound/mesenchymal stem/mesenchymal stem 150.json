The dose of hUC-MSCs will be successively divided into three increasing dose(group A: hUC-MSCs 0.5\u00d710^6/kg, weekly for 4 weeks, 3 patients; group B: hUC-MSCs 1.0\u00d710^6/kg, weekly for 4 weeks, 3 patients; hUC-MSCs 2.0\u00d710^6/kg, weekly for 4 weeks, 3 patients) with 3 patients in each group according to the dose. The principle of increasing dose will be carried out successively from low dose to high dose group. According to the results of the safety and efficacy data from these 9 patients, the investigator will determine one of the doses and expand the sample size to 6 cases."

MSC colony formation, which is known as marrow-like stromal cells and MPCs, is similar to fibroblast colony forming unit (CFU-F) in in vitro condition.

Mesenchymal stem cells exhibit immunomodulatory and anti- inflammatory properties by the use of paracrine effects. Exosomes as a vehicle for signaling, are responsible for a major part of cell to cell signaling. The preclinical animal studies manifested high safety and efficacy for MSC derived exosome treatment on various fistulas and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Placenta-MSCs derived exosomes in treatment of patients with complex preanal fistula (non-crohn's) in phase I and II of clinical trial."

The injection site (medial, lateral, patellar) will be determined based on the side with the most joint space from the findings of the most recent x-rays. The Physician will insert the needle fully into the joint space and begin to expel the fluid. He will achieve a continuous injection flow as he withdraws the needle back out of joint space. Immediately following the SURGENEX SurForce\u00ae injection, an injection of Predictive Biotech CORECYTE(TM) (1 cc) allograft umbilical cord-derived Warton's Jelly tissue matrix will be administered. This will be done using the exact same protocol as the SURGENEX SurForce\u00ae injection."

Donors aged 20 to 50 and tested negative to infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 (HIV-1/2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II), and Tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled. The eligible donor's bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest or femur. The collected BM-MSCs were then cultured, expanded and cryopreserved in a Good Tissue Practice (GTP)-complied laboratory. The qualified cells in cryopreservation meeting the release criteria will be thawed, mixed with lactated Ringer's solution, and transferred into a sterile syringe as the final product.",

For adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation the dosage of remdesivir is a single loading dose of 200 mg sta on Day 1 followed by once daily maintenance doses of 100 mg IV for 9 days (days 2 through 10). For adults not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 5 standard doses will be used. However, patients with known hypersensitivity to Remdesivir, multi organ failure, ALT > 5 times ULN and GFR < 30ml/minute will not be given Remdesivir. In some patients, where indicated other novel treatments including MSC therapy, Tocilizumab and therapeutic plasma exchange will be given.",
                              "Single Dose of 2 x 106 cells/kg will be administered either alone or in combination with other novel therapies. At Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre (AFBMTC), MSCs will be isolated from bone marrow harvested cells. About 50ml bone marrow will be collected from iliac crest using aseptic technique in syringes primed with anticoagulant. The collected sample will be diluted with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and MSCs will be separated using density gradient centrifugation. After resuspension the cells will be seeded at a fixed concentration of 100,000 cells/cm2 in specially designed flasks and incubated at 37Oc in 5% CO2. Medium will be changed after every third day till harvesting of MSCs from the flasks. Once confluent (approximately day 20) the cells will be harvested with sterile techniques using Trypsin- EDTA solution."
