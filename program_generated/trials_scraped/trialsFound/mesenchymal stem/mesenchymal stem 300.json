Data analysis will be performed separately on the knee osteoarthritis subgroup and on the focal chondral defect subgroup. This will consist of a comparison of mean values for VAS scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months. Clinically significant outcomes will be determined based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) occurring for each respective scale, which is defined as the smallest change score needed for the effect to be considered clinically relevant; described below.

The IKDC is a quantitative assessment of knee symptoms with daily and sporting activities with a high score of 100 representing no limitations or pain, with lower scores signifying pain or limitations in knee function. The Lysholm score rates knee pain and symptoms with a high score of 100, with scores > 90 representing excellent function and scores <65 representing poor function.",

T1 rho values increase as degenerative changes worsen; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, it is expected that T1 rho values would increase. T2 mapping values primarily reflect changes in water content and collagen anisotropy. Focal areas of increased T2 mapping values correlate with focal areas of cartilage damage; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, T2 mapping values would decrease. Clinically significant changes will be observed by comparing T1 rho and T2 values in areas of relatively preserved hyaline cartilage within our patients with the areas of degenerative change to utilize an internal control. Data analysis will consist of a comparison of mean values for quantitative T1 rho and T2 mapping data pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 12 and 24-months."

However, it has nine systems and many of the changes (from the Classic BILAG index) are in the items, glossary and scoring scheme.

The HAQ is based on five patient-centered dimensions: disability, pain, medication effects, costs of care, and mortality. It has been validated by mail, in the office, by telephone, and by comparison with paraprofessional and physician judgments as a reliable instrument, and has been significantly correlated with other PRO instruments. Typically, one of two HAQ versions is used: the Full HAQ, which assesses all five dimensions, and the Short or 2-page HAQ, which contains only the HAQ disability index (HAQ-DI) and the HAQ's patient global and pain visual analog scales (VAS)."

It is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity The instrument is presented by a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (symptom, pain, health) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the \"no pain\" anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. No pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm) (11).",

If all 10 sections are completed the score is calculated. Interpretation scores go from minimal 0% disability to 100% disability.",

Scoring - consisting of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.",

This scale is completed by treating consultant surgeon.

We hypothesize that the augmentation using HAM (as scaffold) seeded with AAdMSC would further lower the re-tear rates. We plan to record the recurrence of supraspinatus tendon tear (if any) based on radiographic evaluation with ultrasonography, which will then be confirmed with MRI. Ultrasonography provides an excellent anatomical evaluation of soft tissue which is able to assess any alterations during active locomotion. However, due to its user-dependent nature, we will also confirm the findings with MRI examination. Any grade of re-tear (grade I-III as evaluated by ultrasonography and confirmed with MRI) will be counted in and classified as \"re-tear\". When the patients do not complain about any symptoms of re-tear, we will record them as \"no re-tear\"."

Isolated adherent cells will be processed for the ability to differentiate down osteogenic-, adipogenic- and chondrogenic-lineage after cell harvest. Specifically, isolated cells are treated with different media to induce their differentiation into 1) osteo-progenitor cells (identified by positive staining with Alzarian red, 2) adipocytes (identified by positive staining with Oil-Red) and 3) chondrocytes (identified by positive staining with Alcian blue).

Karnofsky score between 50 to 70 stands for a semi-independent status, that is, the patient is semi-self-care. A score of 50 means the patients require help from others.
