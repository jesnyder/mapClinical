                              "STUDY BACKGROUND\n\nPerianal fistulas are diseases that, by their nature, do not tend to heal spontaneously and are very rarely cured with medical treatment. Their healing is usually pursued through surgery, which often needs to be repeated due to the natural tendency of the fistulas to recur. A surgical treatment that is currently able to provide a high chance of healing is fistulotomy which, however, can injure the anal sphincter and may result in degrading scars and possible fecal incontinence. One possible strategy could be the lipofilling, i.e., autologous adipose tissue transplant containing, among the many, pericytes and progenitor cells, including adult mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\nThis is a no profit interventional prospective multicenter study without drugs where 100 patients (10 each participant centre) with a diagnosis of trans-sphincteric anal fistula that is not suitable to be laid open will be enrolled.\n\nAfter the enrolment, medical history and clinical data will be collected and pre-operatory exams will be performed.\n\nMETHODS\n\n- Harvesting of the adipose tissue\n\nThe lower/lateral abdomen or, eventually, the inner/outer thigh will be chosen as donor site for adipose tissue harvesting under general or spinal anaesthesia. Before the harvesting, the donor site will be injected with 100 cc of Klein Solution (500 cc saline, 1 cc epinephrine 1/1000 IU, and 40 cc lidocaine 2%) using a disposable 17 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 60-cc luer-lock syringe. The fat will be then harvested (50-100 cc) using a 13 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 20-ml VacLok\u00ae syringe.\n\n- Processing of the adipose tissue with the Lipogems\u00ae device\n\nThe harvested fat will be immediately processed in the Lipogems\u00ae processing kit (Lipogems International Spa, Milan, Italy). Lipogems\u00ae is a disposable device that mechanically reduces the size of the adipose tissue clusters while eliminating oily substances and blood residues with pro-inflammatory properties. The entire process is carried out in one surgical step in complete immersion in physiological solution minimizing any traumatic action on the cells and microarchitecture. The processed micro-fragmented fat will be collected in a 60-cc syringe and positioned to decant the excess of saline solution. At the end, the product will be transferred in several 5-cc syringes to be re-injected in the patient.\n\n- Surgical procedure and micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems\u00ae) injection\n\nThe micro-fragmented autologous adipose tissue will be injected with wheals of no more than 1cc in the internal orifice, mucosal, submucosal and muscular layer, then in the fistula tract and external orifice.\n\n- Follow-up visits and outcome measures\n\nAll patients will be assessed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure."
