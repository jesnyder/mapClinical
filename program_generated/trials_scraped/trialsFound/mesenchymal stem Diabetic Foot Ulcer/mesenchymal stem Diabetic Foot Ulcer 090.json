                              "Diabetic foot ulcers are a significant and rapidly growing complication of diabetes and its effects on wound healing. Over half of diabetic patients who develop a single ulcer will subsequently develop another ulcer of which the majority will become chronic non-healing ulcers. Over the past decade, the outcomes for patients with ulcers have not improved, despite advances in wound care.These data suggest the importance and necessity of alternative and more effective treatment option for diabetic patients with non-healing ulcers. (Blumberg et al 2012). Stem cell therapy has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for various diseases including wound repair and tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) represent an important stem cell population with multipotent capabilities that may have high utility for translational clinical applications. MSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, especially fascia originated cells, and provide soluble factors for regeneration of tissues and organs(\u015eener et al 2015). Adipose tissue is an abundant source of mesenchymal stem cells, which have shown an improved outcome in wound healing studies. Adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs )are pluripotent stem cells with the ability to differentiate into different lineages and to secrete paracrine factors initiating tissue regeneration process. The abundant supply of fat tissue, ease of isolation, extensive proliferative capacities ex vivo, and their ability to secrete pro-angiogenic growth factors make them an ideal cell type to use in therapies for the treatment of nonhealing wounds(Hassan et al 2014), However the hostile microenviroment may interfere with viability and efficiency of MSCs injection specially in ischemic tissue , thus increasing needs for new strategies for further improvement of the stem cell therapy of diabetic wounds. Curcumin loaded chitosan nanoparticles into collagen-alginate is a novel biodegradable and biocompatible material that might help a lot in regenerative efficiency in ischemic wound healing"

The wound size reduction evaluation will start two weeks after the first IMP application. The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.\n\nPain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires.

                              "Diabetic foot (DF) is a concomitant illness of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is one of the main causes of non-traumatic amputation worldwide due to severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease with chronic critical limb ischemia being the most abundant problem. Ulceration occurs as failure of oxygenation, nutrient supply and progressive occlusion of larger blood vessels often exacerbates pre-existing microvascular abnormalities.\n\nPurified bone marrow mononuclear cells or expanded bone marrow cells enriched in Cluster of Differentiation 90+ (CD90+) mesenchymal stem cells (named tissue repair cells, [TRCs]) are used in the treatment of diabetic ulcers in comparison to bone marrow derived stem cells to induce revascularization of the affected limb and to enhance local perfusion. Cells are administered intramuscular or intraarterial. A control group of patients treated according national guidelines without stem cells serves as comparator.\n\nDiabetic foot patients with chronic limb ischemia and without the option for surgical or interventional revascularization were recruited and randomized to the transplant groups or the control group within this clinical trial. To measure the therapeutic effects of the various treatment arms patients were evaluated for (ankle brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TcPO2), and reactive hyperemia (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD]). Patients also underwent imaging with angiographic methods."
