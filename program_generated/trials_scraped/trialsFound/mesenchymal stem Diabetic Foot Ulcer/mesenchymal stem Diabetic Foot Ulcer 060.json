Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of lower extremity amputations in the industrialized world. The lifetime occurence of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) is 20% in diabetic patients.\n\nBetween 15% - 25% of the foot ulcers will lead to lower limb amputations.\n\nIt has been shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) could be an effective therapy for many diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, spinal cord injury, liver injury and critical limb ischemia.\n\nStem cells can be obtained from either the patient (autologous) or non-related healthy donors (allogeneic).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of cultured Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSCs) from allogeneic donors for treatment of chronic leg wounds of diabetic patients."

                              "Design: A randomised, controlled, prospective trial. Participants will be patients with non-healing diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nThe study will aim to recruit 15 participants per study group (30 participants in total). Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups:\n\nGroup 1: CYP-006TK\nGroup 2: Standard care This will be an open label study with respect to treatment allocation. However, the person reviewing images of the study ulcers to assess healing will be blind to the participant's treatment allocation.\n\nParticipants assigned to Group 1 will be treated with CYP-0006TK dressings on 8 occasions over 4 weeks. The dressings will be changed every 3 or 4 days. After the first 4 weeks, participants in Group 1 will revert to standard care for the rest of the study. Participants assigned to Group 2 will have their ulcer treated with standard care throughout the study.\n\nParticipants will attend a total of 16 scheduled visits over 24 weeks. There will be a mixture of on-site (hospital/clinic) visits, and home visits. The study will end 24 weeks after the initiation of treatment, unless the study ulcer is completely headed before then."

                              "The ageing population and the increase in diabetes raise the prevalence of chronic skin ulcers (CCU). In diabetics, precursor cell mobilization decreases. In wounds, the inflammation is prolonged and oxidative stress increases. This is an unfavorable microenvironment for healing. A major risk factor in the development of CCU is nutritional deficiency. Healing needs energy and nutrients for regeneration. In diabetics the malnutrition can be more than 60%. However, although the provision of certain nutrients can improve the healing capacity, it is not a common clinical practice to nutritionally evaluate diabetic with CCU. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that reflect the physiological state of the cells producing them. Stem cell derivatives exosomes are rich in factors, that can provide a favorable microenvironment for tissue regeneration.\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a therapeutic process to accelerate the healing of diabetic CCU, based on the correction of nutritional deficiencies, to improve the regenerative capacity, together with the application of exosomes from mesenchymal stem-cell (MSC) in the wound, creating a microenvironment that favors tissue regeneration. For this, a pilot clinical trial with diabetic patients with CCU is proposed, to evaluate the effect of personalized nutritional supplementation on healing and regenerative capacity."
