                              "Hemophilia B is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by the lack of ability to produce blood-clotting factor IX (FIX). Individuals with hemophilia B suffer repeated bleeding episodes, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes even death due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently. The current treatment is intravenous infusion of clotting factor concentrates, either prophylactically or in response to bleeding. The procedure is life time long and expensive while still cannot achieve a cure.Gene therapy is a novel technology that has been successfully demonstrated in a number of clinical studies for diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases. In this study, an advanced lentiviral vector system NHP/TYF will be used to deliver a functional FIX gene to overcome human clotting FIX gene defect in patients with hemophilia B. This study is a Phase I trial evaluating the safety and efficacy for infusion of gene modified autologous stem cells in patients with hemophilia B."
