In addition, many children who were recovered from this disease are suffering from many side effects such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nThe purpose of BPD treatment is to make a baby be able to do spontaneous breathing and to spontaneous breathing a baby needs much energy and because of this a baby may have difficulty to feed. For this reason, medication with steroid, diuretic and respiratory drugs are currently used. However, there is no effective cure so far.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate to pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSC differentiated to bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae is human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells and it is intended to treat premature infants with BPD.

Only data listings were created; no summary or inferential analyses were performed.\n\nSubjects were assessed during Screening and Baseline (prior to randomization) for eligibility in the study. Subjects then received a single IV dose of UNEX-42 at 20 pmol phospholipid/kg body weight, or placebo. After randomization, subjects were monitored in the hospital through 40 Weeks postmentrual age (PMA) or the time of hospital discharge (whichever came first).\n\nThe following efficacy and safety assessments occurred during the course of the study:\n\nEfficacy Assessments: incidence and severity of BPD, duration of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen therapy, duration of postnatal steroids, tracheal aspirate inflammatory biomarkers, and Respiratory Severity Score.\n\nSafety Assessments: physical examination, vital signs, adverse events, predefined complications of prematurity, clinical laboratory parameters, and chest x-ray.\n\nDose administration for Cohort 1 occurred so that there was an observational period of 3 days between dosing the first, second, and third subject to assure the opportunity for safety assessments in at least 1 subject on active treatment. In addition, enrollment between cohorts was to be paused for data review by a Data Monitoring Committee to evaluate the data available after each of the first 2 cohorts were enrolled.\n\nSubjects that completed the Post-treatment Phase (including those that were discharged from the hospital prior to 40 Weeks PMA) continued into the Long-term Outcome Phase and were assessed through 1 year of corrected age."

In addition, many children who recover from the disease suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is intended to treat BPD in premature infants.

                              "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of death for prematurely born babies with low birth weights. In addition, many children who recover from this disease suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is intended to treat BPD in premature infants. The purpose of the study is to evaluate 3-5 year long term safety and efficacy in patients who completed the earlier part of the phase I clinical trial of PNEUMOSTEM\u00ae."

                              "Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (uc-MSC).\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design."
