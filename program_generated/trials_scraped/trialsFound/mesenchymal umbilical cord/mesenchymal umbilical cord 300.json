                              "The BILAG-2004 is a comprehensive composite clinical index that has been recently validated for the assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity. This index is based on the Classic BILAG index and has many similarities with its predecessor: it is based on the principle of the physician's intention to treat, has transitional property that captures changing severity of clinical manifestations and has a similar ordinal scale scoring system. However, it has nine systems and many of the changes (from the Classic BILAG index) are in the items, glossary and scoring scheme. As with the Classic BILAG index, the individual system scores were not intended to be summated into a global score.",
                              "The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) has played an influential role in establishing health outcome assessment as a quantifiable set of reliable, valid and responsive hard data points. The HAQ is based on five patient-centered dimensions: disability, pain, medication effects, costs of care, and mortality. It has been validated by mail, in the office, by telephone, and by comparison with paraprofessional and physician judgments as a reliable instrument, and has been significantly correlated with other PRO instruments. Typically, one of two HAQ versions is used: the Full HAQ, which assesses all five dimensions, and the Short or 2-page HAQ, which contains only the HAQ disability index (HAQ-DI) and the HAQ's patient global and pain visual analog scales (VAS)."
