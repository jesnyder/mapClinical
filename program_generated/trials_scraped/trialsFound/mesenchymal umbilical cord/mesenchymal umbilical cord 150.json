To prepare UC-MSCs for therapy, aliquots of Passage 3 (P3) UC-MSCs will be thawed and cultured to P5 to get approximately 500 million cells and dispensed to 10 million UC-MSCs/ml/vial for cryopreservation. Upon request from the clinical team, aliquots of P5 UC-MSCs will be thawed in a temperature control water bath or incubator on the infusion day.

And after that there will be history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and hysteroscopy examination. If they agree to participate, they will receive separation of adhesions by hysteroscopy surgery and endometrial biopsies, then a collagen scaffold loaded with UC-MSCs will be transplanted into the uterine cavity. The procedure was performed after taking 6 mg/day \u00d7 10 days Progynova, continuous administration of the same dosage Progynova for 30 days and 60mg of progesterone were injected on the 30th day post-operation. Postoperative observation including ultrasound examination once a month for 3 times and hysteroscopy after 3 months. The doctor will select an appropriate time for pregnancy and follow-up including requiring patients to do some unscheduled visits."
