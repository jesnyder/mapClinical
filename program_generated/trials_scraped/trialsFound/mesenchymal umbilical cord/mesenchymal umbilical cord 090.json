Approximately 1 \u00d7 106/kg of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were administered by peripheral intravenous infusion once a month at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Routine medications were used.\n\nFollow-up: Patient follow-up was performed 7 times at 0, 4, 8, 20, 32, 48, and 60 weeks. Blood and urine were collected for determination of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-h urine protein ratio, liver and kidney function, fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, eGFR, blood lipids, and blood electrolytes at each follow-up visit. The daily dose of insulin was recorded. Blood samples were taken after each infusion of stem cells for flow cytometry and for the detection of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28+, Treg, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, CD83, and CD1a cells. Plasma levels of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, IL-12P70, IL-8, and IL-1 beta were also determined.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy within 60 weeks): The number and severity of adverse events, an evaluation of their association with the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell treatment, and the outcome of the adverse events.\n\nThe patients' discomfort and clinical symptoms during the study period were recorded.\n\nThe subjects' relevant laboratory test indices, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination results were recorded during the study.\n\nSecondary endpoint indicators:\n\nEfficacy measures: eGFR, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and percentage changes of 24-h urinary protein quantities from baseline to 60 weeks.\n\nData analysis:\n\nThe number of adverse events and the number of severity adverse events were determined based on the changes in the data summary (i.e., descriptive statistics).\n\nA multilevel statistical analysis model (mixed effects model) was used to infer the relationship between treatment factors and key indicators, reflect the changing trend of key indicators in different time periods, and draw statistical analysis conclusions."

                              "There are more than 100 types of arthritis, and the most common ones are rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The main cause of its pathogenesis is the compensatory hyperplasia of the articular cartilage caused by the body's degenerative changes, which will eventually cause the joint to partially or completely lose its function.\n\nIn the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made to treat OA. The treatment of OA changes with the development of the patient's condition. At present, there are many diagnosis and treatment options for knee OA, including conservative treatment and surgical treatment. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to postpone or terminate the course of OA.\n\nCell therapy for OA has developed rapidly in recent years and has received widespread attention. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with potential of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells are extracted from the patient's body and then implanted back. Their ability of regeneration and reproduction can fill the damaged cartilage tissue, so as to achieve an effective treatment of the joint damage.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction of joint pain, and restoration of joint function."

                              "Lumbar disc herniation causes patients severe lower back pain and radicular pain to decrease the quality of life and lead to great economic burden to patients and society. In recent years, full endoscopic discectomy has been widely used in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation due to its advantages of reduced trauma, enhanced recovery and less cost. However, the reherniation of the residual nucleus pulposus still exist after nerve root decompression. It is urgent to use stem cell and tissue engineering to replace the resection tissue and repair the residual nucleus pulposus for disc resealing. To observe the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) in the treatment of lumbar disc degeneration. This clinical trial is aimed to include a single group of 20 patients with lumbar disc herniation. Twenty million hUCMSCs will be injected into the lumbar disc of the enrolled patients in this non-random, self-controlled and single-dose open study design. The patients will be followed up for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the injection to evaluate the safety of the patients after grafting hUCMSCs. Additionally, improvement of patients' quality of life will be evaluated using the ODI score, VAS score and SF-36 score. Lumbar disc signals will be also quantified using MRI to demonstrate hUCMSCs transplantation could slow down lumbar disc degeneration."

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI), damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves, often causes permanent neurofunction deficit, including strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of injury. WHO reported 15-40/million people suffer from SCI each year, about 250,000 to 500,000 people. The majority of SCI victims are young patients, who are at the time of working age. As a result of that, SCI not only affects the physical and psychological health of those patients, but also bring huge economic burden to their families, as well as the society. The current treatments for SCI mainly include surgical operation, neuroregenerative medicine, physical therapy, chinese acupuncture and so on. However, none of these methods are efficient enough to make any functional recovery of neurological injury in patients, and most patients will have to face paraplegia or tetraplegia.\n\nThe most challenge of SCI treatment are reported to be regeneration of axon and rewiring of the damaged spinal cord. The properties of strong proliferation and differentiation make stem cell transplantation possible to replace the damage axon and rebridge the injury spinal cord. Currently, evidences from animal experiments and pilot clinical studies have reported that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation was a potential method to treat spinal cord injury, but its safety and efficacy remain controversial.\n\nThis study will conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of different phrases of SCI, including sub-acute, early stage, and late stage of chronic SCI. These three trials will investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal transplantation of UC-MSC in patients with SCI treatment. The study will be conducted at 3 hospitals in China, covering eastern, southern and western of Chinese mainland.\n\nThe primary outcome is the changes of motor and sensory assessment before and after intervention using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Score Scale. Secondary outcomes will include International Association of Neural Restoration Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIRFS), electromyogram test, residual urine test and adverse events.\n\nThe enrolled participants will be followed up at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation. Besides, the samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected, before and after treatment, to explore the potential mechanism of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of SCI.\n\nThe results of this study will, for the first time, provide high level of evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy."

SCI is not only a severe healthy problem but also a great social burden. To the best of our knowledge, cell therapy seems to be a promising alternative for the treatment of SCI due to numerous advantages. However, cytotherapy is still in its infancy since there are many disparities and uncertainties regarding subject selection, cellular type, transplantation timing, administration dose and deliver route in clinical trial protocols. Hence, a standardized well-designed clinical study is urgently required for the safe and effective treatment of SCI.\n\nIn this study, complete or incomplete cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar SCI subjects were recruited to join in a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial. Intervention is four times of subarachnoid administration of allogeneic hUC-MSCs. During the intervention and follow-up periods of this trial, any adverse event was identified rapidly and managed properly. The maximum intensity and relationship of any adverse event with hUC-MSCs administration were identified.The primary efficacy indicator is American spinal injury association (ASIA) total score at the fourth follow-up and SCI Functional Rating Scale of the International Association of Neurorestoratology (IANR-SCIFRS) total score at the fourth follow-up. Secondary efficacy indicators are these two indicators at the remaining time points, scores of pin prick, light touch, motor and sphincter, muscle spasticity and spasm, autonomic system, bladder and bowel functions, residual urine volume. Subgroup analysis of primary efficacy indicators was also performed.\n\nIn this trial, informed consent forms that had the approval of the institutional review board were obtained from all participants before recruitment. In this clinical study, subarachnoid transplantation of hUC-MSCs was performed a total of four times per subject with the delivery dose of 1\u00d710E6 cells/kg. After the completion of cytotherapy, subject was regularly followed up in the hospital at four time points, determined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the final administration of hUC-MSCs. At each time point of administration (the first, second, third, and fourth transplantation) and follow-up (the first, second, third, and fourth follow-up), safety and efficacy indicators were collected accordingly by two independent assessors."

Liver cirrhosis has become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality with over one million people died due to cirrhosis in 2010 worldwide. Currently, the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. However, the shortage in donor organ availability and the side-effect associated with long-term immunosuppression after transplant requires the development of new alternative therapies for liver cirrhosis. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) as well as umbilical cord-derive mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. In Vietnam, however, there are no clinical trials to date that investigate the potential of UC-MSCs for liver cirrhosis management. This is a phase I, open label, single arm trial using UC-MSCs to treat patients with liver cirrhosis that includes 20 patients. The primary outcome measure will be change in MELD score at 3, 6, and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation from baseline. The safety is assessed by frequency and severity of the adverse event or serious adverse event associated with stem cell injection. This study could reconfirm the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis and would open a novel cell therapy for the treatment of adult liver cirrhosis"

The research process is as follows: 1. Sixteen eligible patients with ischemic heart disease were recruited, fully informed, and signed a consent form, and randomly divided into placebo control group (n=8) or hUC-MSCs treatment group (n=8); 2. Knee replacement was performed under general anesthesia in both groups. In the cell therapy group, 1\u00d710^6/kg human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells were intravenously injected to the patient immediately after the surgery and at day 3 after the surgery. Before the operation, 6 hours, 3 days, 7days, 14 days, and 28 days after the MSCs injection, all patients receive a review of which main content includes symptom improvement, lung function improvement, and adverse events."

Regenerative medicine, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation, has developed extensively, with preclinical and clinical trials emphasizing the benefits of stem cell therapy for restoration of sexual deficiency. n our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency. In phase II, 40 males with hormone deficiency will be recruited and divided randomly into two groups (n=23 each). The group A will receive UC-MSCs intravenously at day 0 and day 90 \u00b1 7, while the group B will be infused with UC-MSCs at day 180 \u00b1 14 and day 270 \u00b1 14. Each group will be monitored for 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion. The phase II is to investigate safety and efficacy of UC-MSC infusion for the treatment of sexual hormone deficiency in males.\n\nThe primary outcome are: (1) numbers of AEs or SAEs during UC-MSC infusion and 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion; (2) Testosterone levels and sexual life quality through quantification of Aging Men Symptom (AMS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQoL-M) at day 90 \u00b1 7 and day 180 \u00b1 14 of the group A compared to those of the group B.\n\nThe secondary outcome are: (1) Testosterone levels and (2) sexual life quality through quantification of AMS, IIEF, and SQoL-M at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion of each group compared to the baseline; (3) cytokine concentration (TNFa, IFN-\u03b3, IL1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, IDO) in serum of the participants and their T cell immunophenotype at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion."

                              "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) refers to the clinicopathological synthesis of lymphocytes from the donor attacking the recipient's organs during the process of rebuilding the donor's immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) Signs (including classic cGVHD and overlap syndrome) are one of the main complications after transplantation, with an incidence of 30% to 70%. cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. main reason. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) About 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD.\n\nIn 2002, Frassoni reported for the first time that MSCs expanded in vitro were used to evaluate the efficacy of allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT transplanted patients with hematological malignancies were enrolled. MSCs were derived from the donor's bone marrow. After expanded in vitro, participants were combined with the donor's hematopoietic stem cells for reinfusion. As a result, the incidence of aGVHD in the MSCs expansion group and cGVHD within 6 months was significantly lower in the control group, the 6-month OS was significantly higher than that in the control group, and there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate. Subsequently, in 2004, Le Blanc and others successfully used third-party MSCs to successfully treat a refractory grade IV intestinal combined with liver aGVHD for the first time. Subsequently, MSCs were increasingly used in clinical studies for the treatment of GVHD. More clinical trials have shown that umbilical cord-derived MSCs cultured in vitro can not only promote the implantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), but also reduce the incidence of severe GVHD in patients, showing a good therapeutic effect."

For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

For the patients who have suffered from ischemic stroke in 3 months, indeed, they have the opportunity to get symptomatic improvement through receiving conventional stroke treatments that including rehabilitation. At the same time, these treatments are ineffective in some cases. Alternatively, the phenomenon of increasing brain plasticity after stroke provoke an essential therapy. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment enhances a functional improvement after cerebral ischemia, likewise, treament in rodent models are proved effective. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells therapy performs a role as take the place destroyed cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. The totality of evidence from trials running umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplanted into patients suffering from ischemic stroke support the safety of this approach.

                              "Viral pneumonia is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by respiratory viruses. It is mainly caused by the invasion of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and adenovirus into the lower respiratory tract. Every winter and spring is the epidemic season. Influenza virus and adenovirus have high infectivity and pathogenicity. The rapid progress of some patients may be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction And died of complications. The fatality rate of severe patients is 9.8% - 60%. Most of the dead cases were the elderly and the patients with basic diseases. In addition to the complications, the main cause of death is ARDS caused by virus infection, on the other hand, the basic immune function of the elderly is poor, so it is difficult to form an effective antiviral response in response to virus infection. The direct destruction of the alveolar epithelial barrier and the systemic inflammatory response induced by the infection, namely, the destruction of the alveolar capillary barrier by the inflammatory waterfall, are the important pathogenesis of ARDS. How to effectively regulate the inflammatory response, prevent the inflammatory exudation and edema of the lungs, improve oxygenation, and reduce organ damage; at the same time, how to effectively improve the basic immune function and enhance the anti-virus immune response of such patients, has become the key to the success of the treatment of patients with severe viral pneumonia.\n\nUmbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) can differentiate into the different germ layers and play an important role in immune regulation and damage repair regulation. Clinical trials have shown that MSC is safe and effective in the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, and it can improve the immune function of patients with viral infectious diseases. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against severe viral pneumonia.\n\nThis is a randomized, singlecenter, open lable, intervention controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 40) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The routine treatment group (n = 20) will receive the treatment according to \"Influenza diagnosis and treatment plan (2019 version)\", the HUC-MSCs adjuvant Group (n = 20) will receive intravenous infusion of definitive HUC-MSCs (1\u00d710^6 cells/Kg \u00d7 body weight(kg), which was selected by immunomodulatory assay through coculture with BV2 cell) on the basis of the routine treatment once at day 1 after joining. Follow-up duration is 90 days. The difference of 90 day mortality and average length of stay between the two groups will be observed and recorded. The changes of inflammatory index, viral load, oxygenation index and pulmonary imaging will be monitored at different time points after treatment in the two groups. The serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) will be observed during the period.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore the efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of severe viral pneumonia through improving the antiviral immune response of patients, reduce the lung inflammatory damage caused by the virus and the pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the injury, and finally achieve the goal of reducing the mortality and improving the prognosis of severe patients, and to evaluate the safety."

CP is an umbrella term and represents a group of conditions (not a single disorder) , has a broad range of expression with a static condition originally within the developing central nervous system . CP Is a disturbance of movement and or posture . At the present time there is no standard medical or surgical treatment for it .Stem cell therapy is a new and promising treatment .\n\n150 cases of diparetic and quadiparetic spastic CP between 4-14 years old selected among the patients referred to the pediatric neurology outpatient department of Children's Medical Center Hospital (CMC) affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences and had our inclusion criteria. HLA analysis were done for these patients and 36 cases of class 6 matched cases enrolled to the hematopoietic stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MNC) because of necessity of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching in this type of cells and 72 cases among the remaining patients randomly divided to Mesenchymal stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MSC) and control group . Therefore 108 cases enrolled in 3 divided group of 36 patients .\n\nPatients admitted to CMC hospital and intrathecal injection were done with sedation . Only one injection of stem cell was done for each patient . In the control group after insertion of the needle into the skin with an appearance of lumbar puncture simulation , no injection were done without the awareness of the patients or their parents. All of the patients admitted for one day and discharged the next day . As we wrote in the consent form for ethical consideration we are committed to perform stem cell injection for control participants free of charge after 12 months of the follow up . All of the participants will be referred for neurorehabilitation with a identical protocol .Both parents and clinical evaluators are not aware of the 3 divided groups and our study is double blind .Outcome measures will be evaluated 1, 3, 6. and 12 months after intervention .\n\nStandard brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) were done before injection as baseline and will be repeated after 12 months of clinical follow up . This study designed for the evaluation of therapeutic effects of intrathecal MNC and MSC derived from allogenic umbilical cord in change and probable improvement of developmental functions of spastic CP patients between 4-14 years old in comparison with control group .Different scoring systems such as Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) , Gross Motor Function Measure Score (GMFM66) , Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) , Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) , CP QOL , Life Habits Questionnaire and Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity were done at baseline and then will be repeated in follow ups until 12 months of final evaluation .\n\nAcute side effects and probable long term side effects will be reported and noted on our preformed questioners ."

                              "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure in which progenitor cells capable of reconstituting normal bone marrow function are administered to a patient. This procedure has been used to treat adults and children with life-threatening hematological malignancies and congenital immunodeficiency disorders.\nIn HSCT, therapeutic goal is an elimination of disease and enrichment of regenerating capacity to achieve engraftments resulting in continued generation of functional blood elements from the engrafted living cells. Transplantation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cells originating either from adult bone marrow or from peripheral blood often leads to graft-versus host-disease (GvHD), opportunistic infections and graft failure after transplantation.\nIn HSCT, MSC have been used as a therapy for GvHD and other complications. The aim of MSC infusions in HSCT is to use the cells' immunomodulatory effects to promote engraftment and to reduce the immunological reactions giving rise to GvHD.\nThere is a growing interest in co-transplantation of MSC and HSC to improve the donor outcome in the unrelated HSCT condition."

Each group contains 8 patients. Investigators treat the participants with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells via venous transfusion. First investigators arrange a whole test for participants, such as vital sign examination, laboratory test, ECG, CT, MRI, ultrasound etc. Investigators screen these patients with a complete eligibility criteria. Then investigators proceed the therapy in the 1st, 8th and 15th day. There are 8 times of follow-up visit for these patients, 4 times of those are proceeded during the hospitalization, while other 4 times happens after the discharge. The follow-up visit includes vital sign examination, laboratory test, ECG, CT, MRI, ultrasound, Child-Pugh grade, MELD grade, SF-36 test. These follow-up visit last 24 weeks since the first treatment. After that, investigators also arrange a survival visit through phone or clinic each 6 months, lasting another 1.5 years. The main object of this research is investigating the survival rate, promotion of the liver function, improvement of health, safety of hUC-MSCs, tolerability of patients, for exploring a new way for the therapy of decompensated liver cirrhosis with HBV."

                              "In recent decades, the percentage of Cesarean section (CS) deliveries has dramatically increased around the world. While it allows safe delivery in many situations, the risks of severe maternal complications associated with cesarean delivery are higher than those associated with vaginal delivery. These maternal complications include short term, long-term, the next pregnancy, and the non-pregnant state, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and postmenstrual spotting.\n\nUterine niche, also named cesarean scar defect, deficient cesarean scar, pouch, or diverticulum, is defined as a triangular anechoic structure at the site of the scar or a gap in the myometrium at the site of a previous caesarean section. It is one of the most common complications associated with previous cesarean section. The primary clinical manifestation is postmenstrual spotting, which may seriously affect the daily life of patients. The treatment includes medical treatment, such as oral contraceptives, and surgical methods, such as hysteroscopy resectoscopic correction, endometrial ablation, laparoscopic surgery, and transvaginal repair surgery. Although good outcomes are reported in each study, present treatments could not decrease the incidence among women after undergoing cesarean section.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are long-lived cells with the ability of both self-renewal and differentiation into multi-potential cells, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. Trials with MSCs in patients after myocardial infarction have shown an excellent safety and efficacy. In this trial, the investigators postulate that MSCs can reduce uterine niche and convert scar tissue to viable myometrium. To test the hypothesis, the investigators therefore undertake a Phase II clinical trial of the treatment for uterine niche among primiparous women who undergo cesarean section.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment on the caesarean section uterine scars. A total of one hundred and twenty (120) participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive direct local intramuscular injection of 1*10^7 MSCs (a dose of 1*10^7 cells in 1 ml of 0.9% saline) (MSCs group) or an identical-appearing 1ml of 0.9% saline placebo (placebo-controlled group). Cesarean procedures and care will follow usual practices. All participants will be performed by obstetricians from the investigators' department using a unified double-layer uterine closure technique with a continuous absorbable polyglycolic 1-0 suture. After suturing the uterine incision, direct local intramuscular injection will be performed in the uterine incision as soon as possible on the operating table. One ml solution will be injected as twenty aliquots of 0.05ml into each injection site on the incision. Injection sites will be selected near the incision at evenly 20 different sites. Participants will be followed up at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, the investigators will utilize an \"intention-to-treat\" study population."

                              "Cerebral palsy refers to a neurological disorder caused by a non-progressive brain injury or malformation that occurs in early childhood. It can result in central motor deficits, developmental retardation, abnormal posture, abnormal muscular strength, abnormal muscle tone and/or dysreflexia. It has a high disability rate. There is currently no effective treatment for cerebral palsy. Conventional treatments for cerebral palsy are often tiresome and expensive and have a slow onset of action. Stem cells have been recently used in the treatment of cerebral palsy. This provides a novel method for the treatment of cerebral palsy. According to the existing clinical studies, neural stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are mainly used as the seed cells for the treatment of cerebral palsy. UC-MSCs are the most promising seed cells for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of the advantages including rich sources, ease of harvesting, short doubling time, low immunogenicity, long-time survival post-transplantation, and no ethical issues. UC-MSCs have been widely used to treat Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, traumatic brain injury, aplastic anemia, and decompensated liver disease. However,only two studies, and performed only in China, are reported on the treatment of cerebral palsy with UC-MSCs. One from the Hospital 463 of PLA reported 51 patients with cerebral palsy whose symptoms had not been obviously improved after 1 year of rehabilitative treatment. These patients received intrathecal injection of UC-MSCs for three times, once a week, followed by one injection of UC-MSCs via the peripheral vein in the fourth week. Four UC-MSCs injections, once per week, were considered as one course of treatment. Activities of daily living scale score was compared between before and after treatment to evaluate efficacy. Another study is a case report from China. In this report, a combined intravenous and intrathecal injection of UC-MSCs was used to treat cerebral palsy in a 5-year-old child. 28-month follow-up results revealed that the child's gross motor function, immune function, muscle strength, and language ability improved and adverse reactions were not obvious."

The human umbilical cord (HUC) is a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), compared to embryonic stem cells, HUC-MSCs are noncontroversial with a painless collection procedure and faster self-renewal properties. HUC-MSCs can differentiate into the different germ layers and modulate immune responses. One possible mechanism for the onset and development of aging frailty is the depletion of stem cells. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against aging frailty.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 30) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The HUC-MSCs Group (n = 15) will receive intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells twice over a month (30 days interval), the Control Group (n = 15) will receive the same protocolized intervention with normal saline. Follow-up duration is 6 months after first intervention. The reported serious adverse events\uff08SAEs\uff09will be observed within one month post infusion. The short-item from health survey\uff08SF-36), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Fried phenotype scale will be evaluated. Short physical performance battery (SPPB) and plasm biomarkers will be assessed.The assessments will be performed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore domains of efficacy of HUC-MSCs through the reduction of signs and symptoms of aging frailty and to evaluate the safety of HUC-MSCs in subjects with aging frailty."

                              "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease involving primarily the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. The main clinical features are back pain and progressive stiffness of the spine. Oligoarthritis of the hips and shoulders, enthesopathy, and anterior uveitis are common, and involvement of the heart and lungs is rare. The current understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder is limited.It mainly about to hereditary susceptibility (eg hla-b27),infection and autoimmunity.\n\nAlthough traditional drugs, such as Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs such as MTX,SASP OR thalidomide) and steroids have been used in the treatment of AS, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response to these drugs is not satisfied. Addition, the severe side effects of these drugs have also been observed. The management of AS patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed. Human MSCs isolated from human umbilical cord/placenta have been shown to have immunoregulatory, immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC transplantation in the AS patients.\n\nThis study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MSC transplant +DMARDs therapy (experimental group) or DMARDs therapy (control group). Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. After 3 months, patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After six and twelve months from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated."

Patients with severe aplastic anemia produce too few blood cells, causing fatigue, easy bruising and bleeding, and susceptibility to infections. In many cases, the very low blood counts result from an autoimmune process. The patient's own immune system damages their stem cells in bone marrow.\n\nAlthough immune-suppressing drugs, such as corticosteroids, CsA and ATG, have been used in the treatment of SAA, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response rate to these drugs is less than 60%. Addition, the severe side effects of these immune-suppressing drugs have also been observed. The management of SAA patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed. Human MSCs isolated from human umbilical cord/placenta have been shown to have immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC transplantation in the SAA patients.\n\nThis study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MSC transplant and CsA therapy (experimental group) or CsA therapy alone (control group). Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. After 3 months, patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After six and twelve months from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated."

Currently, there is no treatment.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 variation from baseline at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be randomized to cell-treatment administered via intravenous route while the remaining 20 patients will be randomized to receive a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Patients will be followed up to 12 months after treatment.\n\nState of the art:\n\nMesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020), regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products.\n\nSo far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018) and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al., 2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010).\n\nOnce they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013) and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017).\n\nGiven the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 circulating levels and an increase in CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng et al., 2020)."

                              "Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty. Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July 2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies"

Human umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have documented anti-inflammatory properties, which suggest these cells may be effective at treating Bradykinesia. It is understood that perinatal products are potent immune modulators. It is believed that the positive symptomatic effects are secondary to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in pathological inflammation. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia."

It will also aid in the better understanding of the role of stem cell therapy in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson disease. The safety outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body. While the efficacy results if encouraging, would mean an improvement in the disability associated with PD and reduction in the life-time care and treatment provided to this category of patients in Jordan and the Arab region."

                              "There are about 1.7 billion people with different types of chronic liver diseases in the world, of which about 240 million are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and about 15%-40% of chronic hepatitis B can develop into liver cirrhosis and die of liver hardness every year There are hundreds of thousands of patients. There are about 90 million hepatitis B carriers in China, including about 20 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Every year, about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated liver cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. From the progression of liver fibrosis to the decompensation of liver cirrhosis, liver failure often occurs. Statistics show that slow increase The 28-day mortality rate of patients with acute liver failure of grade 1, 2 and 3 is as high as 22%, 32% and 77%. The 90-day mortality rate was 41%, 73%, 95%. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the most effective means to treat decompensated liver failure due to liver cirrhosis, However, the shortage of donor liver, immune rejection and high cost have become treatment obstacles. Application of artificial liver support system for blood flow Plasma replacement can remove toxic substances from blood, but it can't supplement albumin and coagulation factors, and it is important to whether reducing the mortality rate is still controversial. Therefore, it reverses or delays the process of liver cirrhosis and reduces the compensatory stage of liver cirrhosis It is an important link in the treatment of liver diseases that the patients develop into decompensated stage The curative effect of medical treatment on hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory period) is very limited; Liver transplantation is difficult to popularize in clinical application due to the lack of donors and high cost. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are derived from mesoderm in early development, is a high degree of self-renewal ability, Pluripotent stem cells with high proliferation ability and multidirectional differentiation potential widely exist in bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, and other tissues. They can be cultured and expanded in vitro, and can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, cartilage tissues, nerve cells, hepatocytes and so on under the control of specific conditions, which has great application value in cell therapy and tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory stage). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group, with 10 cases in each group, a total of 20 cases. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, namely, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with stem cells based on conventional medical treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of patients were observed in detail within 24 weeks after treatment, and the long-term effect of stem cell therapy was observed after 96 weeks of treatment."

                              "Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious complications and the main cause of death in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Type III, type IV and type V LN are severe clinical entities with poor prognosis, and its treatment remains challenging. Currently, type III, type IV, type V, type III plus V and type IV plus V LN are treated mainly according to the guidelines developed by KDIGO and the European Association for Anti-Rheumatism and European League Against Rheumatism/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERAEDTA). The main therapeutic regimens recommended by these guidelines include glucocorticoid combined with immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide (CTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), etc. These medications can significantly induce disease remission and improve the long-term survival. However, some patients do not adequately response to the treatment of the combination of steroids and immunosuppressants, and the disease activity cannot be well-controlled. The high prevalence of steroids and immunosuppressants related adverse effects, such as steroid-related diabetes, bone necrosis, hypertension, peptic ulcer, CTX-related bone marrow and gonadal suppression, MMF-related infection risk and so on, have been found in long-term follow-up study. In addition, to date, there is insufficient data to support the use of new biologics, such as rituximab and abatacept in the induction therapy in patients with LN.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be obtained from several tissues and possess multiple differentiation potencies and immunomodulatory effects. The investigators have investigated the usefulness, and confirmed the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment of LN in animal models, in vitro experiments and phase I clinical trial. The studies also for the first time found that the MSC abnormalities are involved in the onset and development of lupus both in the lupus mice model and in SLE patients. The investigators found that the efficacy of allogeneic (xenogeneic) MSC transplantation is superior to autologous MSC transplantation in LN mice model. Thus, in current opinion, SLE is not only a hematopoietic stem cell disease, but also a mesenchymal stem cell disease. The investigators treated the refractory LN patients with allogenic MSC treatment, the outcomes revealed that the total response rate was 60%, the mortality rate of 2 to 5 years decreased from 35% - 45% to 6%. These results strongly support the use of allogenic MSC transplantation in the refractory LN patients. The mechanisms of MSC treatment include correcting the immune unbalance, inducing immune tolerance, tissue repair and the improvement of organ function. Allogeneic MSC transplantation for the treatment of SLE and other refractory autoimmune diseases have shown significant efficacy and excellent safety. However, these studies have limitations due to the lack of large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective study to further confirm the efficacy of allogeneic MSC transplantation, as well as the guideline for MSC treatment in SLE needs to be developed. Therefore, a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority, prospective, multicenter clinical trial is urgent needed to promote the application of MSC transplantation in SLE treatment, to bring the benefit of the patients with SLE."

COVID-19 is characterized by sustained cytokines production and hyper-inflammation, can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness with a fatality rate around 2-5%. There are currently no prophylactic vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment agents available recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19.\n\nDuring the last decade, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial is needed to assess efficacy and safety.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs (4.0*10E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 30 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group.\n\nChange in lesion proportion (%) of full lung volume from baseline to day 10, day28 and 90, change in consolidation/ ground-glass lesion proportion (%) of full lung volume from baseline to day 10, 28 and 90, time to clinical improvement in 28 days, mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale, 6-minute walk test, maximum vital capacity (VCmax), Diffusing Capacity (DLCO), oxygen saturation, oxygenation index, duration of oxygen therapy, side effects, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days follow up."

                              "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (acute-on-chronic liver failure, ACLF) is a special type of rapid deterioration of liver function that occurs on the basis of cirrhosis or non-cirrhosis, which is characterized by sequential multiple organ failure and high short-term (28 days) mortality (15%). ACLF was first proposed by Jalan R and Williams R. in 2002. It is a newly discovered type of critically ill liver disease characterized by high short-term mortality after hospitalization [1]. At present, the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF is not clear, and its definition in Europe and Asia-Pacific is still controversial. However, severe systemic inflammatory response is often closely related to the cause, accompanied by single or multiple organ failure are three important characteristics of ACLF. In the past ten years, the prevalence of ACLF has increased. Due to the rapid progress of the disease and the close relationship between mortality and organ failure, there is no effective method to improve the survival rate of ACLF patients except liver transplantation. The latest literature review shows that the 28-day and 90-day mortality rates are as high as 27.8-37.6% and 40-, respectively. 51.2%[2].\n\nIn 2013, European Association for the Study of Chronic Acute Liver Failure\uff08EASL-CLIF\uff09 conducted a prospective multi-center EASL-CLIF Chronic Acute Liver Failure (CANONIC) study in 29 liver disease treatment centers in eight European countries, and proposed chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment\uff08CLIF-SOFA\uff09score is used as the clinical diagnostic criteria for alcoholic and hepatitis B virus\uff08HBV\uff09related ACLF. According to the CLIF-SOFA score, the 90-day mortality rate of ACLF patients is as high as 51%, while that of non-ACLF patients is 10% [3]. The European CANONIC study also shows that systemic inflammation is the main driving force of multiple organ failure, which is a typical pathogenesis of ACLF patients with western liver cirrhosis [4]. For another, the current Asian ACLF diagnostic criteria is the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) criteria, which reached a consensus in 2009, and the guidelines were improved in 2014, but there is still a lack of multi-center, prospective evidence-based medical evidence to support . In 2016, led by the person in charge of this project, an oriental ACLF prospective multi-center observation cohort was established in China, which included 3970 ACLF high-risk patients, filling the gap in the natural course and mortality of oriental ACLF patients, and established a 90-day oriental ACLF diagnostic criteria for mortality [5]. The person in charge of this project also explored the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF patients in areas with high prevalence of oriental HBV. The study showed that submassive hepatic necrosis is an important histological feature in ACLF patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. The systemic inflammatory response of multiple organ failure caused by parenchymal liver cells has a similar mechanism to that of western alcoholic ACLF [6]. Although the causes of ACLF type are not the same in the East and the West, the cohorts from the East and the West have confirmed the short-term high mortality rate of ACLF. Systemic inflammation, sub-large necrosis, and aseptic inflammation may all important reasons that lead to multiple organ failure and eventual death of ACLF patients.\n\nDue to the high short-term mortality of ACLF and the limited liver source for liver transplantation, exploring new methods for the treatment of ACLF is a major issue facing clinical research. Mesenchymal stem cells have great application prospects in regenerative medicine because of their strong self-renewal, low immunogenicity, non-tumorigenicity and strong immune regulation ability[7]. Many previous documents have confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells in animal models can promote liver cell regeneration, resist inflammation, regulate local microenvironment and anti-fibrosis [8-10]. Among them, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) have attracted attention of researchers because they are easily obtained from the medical waste-the umbilical cord, are not invasive, and have high expansion capabilities in vitro [11]. The possible mechanism of UC-MSC in the treatment of end-stage liver disease is that it can repair the liver. At present, there are the following opinions: \u2460 Cell rehabilitation. In the case of liver failure, MSC can differentiate into hepatocytes and play an alternative therapeutic effect. A large number of studies have shown that MSC can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in different inducing factors and culture systems in vitro, capable of storing glycogen and urea synthesis. Function; \u2461Immune regulation. Studies have shown that MSC can regulate immune cells by secreting a variety of cytokines in the body, and play an immunomodulatory effect; \u2462Anti-fibrosis. MSC can induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis or inhibit its activation, and can secrete anti-fibrotic substances such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor and matrix metallopeptidase 9\uff08MMP-9\uff09to reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix and inhibit the formation of liver fibrosis.\n\nAccording to the results of a single-center clinical trial published by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in the previous period, there were no serious adverse reactions at 6 hours and 72 weeks after intravenous infusion of MSCs. The dose was (1-6)*10^7 cells/time for 4 times, confirming the safety and effectiveness of both low-dose and high-dose treatments. Another open clinical trial of Beijing 302 Hospital used mesenchymal stem cells at a dose of 5*10^5 cells/kg (based on the patient's weight of 60kg, the dose was 3*10^7 cells/time), excluded severe ACLF patients accompanied by severe infections and other sever complications. In addition, previous pharmacokinetic tests showed that the half-life of mesenchymal stem cells in animals is 3 days.\n\nTherefore, this research plans to carry out a single-center open clinical trial to confirm the safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ACLF, and provide stronger clinical evidence for the safety of UC-MSCs in the treatment of ACLF."

Inclusion criteria for the study are knee OA patients who are eligible for HAM and HUMCWJ therapy of their knee, no previous HAM or HUMCWJ therapy, between the ages of 50-85, independently residing in the community, no previously diagnosed cognitive decline or mental illness, and not taking pain medication more than once per week for a condition other than knee OA. Recruitment will be done in two parts as participants will self-select to participate in one of two study groups. All participants who elect to have the procedure done at the initial consultation, meet inclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 1. Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection. The T1 and T2 data collections will use the same data collection procedures and questionnaires."

                              "The chronic kidney disease is caused by renal structural and functional impairment for more than 3 months due to various causes, including normal and abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), abnormal blood, urine, and imaging findings, or an unexplained decline in GFR (<60 ml/min). Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. The incidence of CKD and the primary causative factors vary from country to country and region, and the idemiological survey led by Peking University Hospital shows that the prevalence of CKD in China is 10.8% , the primary causative factor is glomerulonephritis, but as the incidence of hypertension and diabetes rises year by year, and the world will have more than 10 million people a year have acute kidney injury, the proportion of chronic kidney disease in the long-term course of the above population will be much higher than the normal population, chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.\n\nSummarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.\n\nCurrent treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. The presence of the above complications will reduce the service life of the patient's dialysis pathway while also causing blows to other organ systems. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier, and the average survival of transplanted kidneys is currently 12 years calculated by the American National Kidney Foundation, during this period, patients need to take anti-rejection drugs uninterruptedly, and these drugs (such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.) can also greatly damage the kidney organs and function. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease.\n\nProgression in chronic kidney disease includes tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis:\n\n1) Tubular interstitial fibrosis is mainly characterized by tubular hypermetabolism, tubular epithelial-interstitial transition, and hypoxic damage to the renal interstitium, which eventually leads to infiltration of inflammatory cells, abnormal increase in extracellular matrix components in renal tissue, and disappearance of parenchymal cells. 2)Glomerulosclerosis is the outcome of excessive response of glomerular constituent related cells to injury, including structural changes, cells' gradual atrophy, shedding, apoptosis of cells, loss of anticoagulant properties, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pro-fibrosis factors; Proliferation of mesangial cells, mesangial differentiation into myofibroblasts, causing collagen III to be deposited in the renal units, leading to irreversible hardening of the glomeruli; The number of pinus process cells decreases, the skeleton retracts or flattens, and inflammatory cell aggregation of chemokines is released, while synthetic cytokines and growth factors further aggravate globules capillary sclerosis.\n\nBoth pathophysiological abnormalities are characterized by parenchymal cell loss and activation of the inflammatory immune response. However, due to the weak regenerative capacity of renal tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells, foot process cells even lack regenerative ability, these renal parenchymal cells are difficult to repair themselves once damaged, and the kidney lacks stem/progenitor cells, which cannot achieve stem/progenitor cell differentiation and regeneration. Therefore, after severe kidney damage, the existing treatment methods cannot promote the complete repair of the kidneys, often resulting in the delay of kidney disease, which is also the main reason why chronic kidney disease has become the highest incidence of chronic disease in humans.\n\nMSCs are only briefly present in the renal vascular system, and Togel F, Hu Z et al. found that their presence was not detected within the renal parenchyma after 3 days of MSC infusion, and in general, stem cells were only briefly present in the blood vessels of the kidneys and could not colonize for long periods of time7. Studies such as Camila Eleuterio Rodrigues found that gene expression in the kidneys of MSC-treated rats showed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in several growth factors with pro-mitosis, pro-survival, and anti-apoptosis effects8. There is a large body of research evidence that MSCs modulate the immune response primarily through paracrine/endocrine nutritional growth factors and ultimately promote renal repair.1)Stem cells secrete immunomodulatory correlates;2) Stem cell secretion promotes renal vascular formation and tubular cell regeneration related factors;3)MSC may also reduce renal fibrosis and structural remodeling through immunomodulation;4)Stem cell secretion improves matrix metabolism-related factors.\n\nmesenchymal stem cell therapy has a good safety record, there is no obvious toxic side effects for patients, a small number of patients have injection of local discomfort, transient low-grade fever, etc., generally do not need special treatment, patients will recover naturally, long-term observation has not found that patients have increased microbial infections and the carcinogenicity of Mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nCharacteristics and advantages of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs isolated from umbilical cord tissue, not only maintain the biological characteristics of MSCs, but also have the following advantages compared to other tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells: 1) Convenient materials, which is waste utilization. 2) The process is less invasive to the donor than the extraction of bone marrow MSCs. 3) The isolated cell content and proliferation ability are better than bone marrow MSCs, and the immunogenicity is lower than that of bone marrow MSCs, which is not easy to trigger the immune response or cause graft-versus-host disease. 4) The differentiation potential is stronger, and differentiation can be carried out in multiple directions. 5) Stronger ability to secrete cytokines and may have a stronger paracrine (exosome) repair effect. 6) Compared with bone marrow MSCs, the results of gene lineage comparison show that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells can express more genes and proteins related to matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, which is more suitable in the field of nephropathy treatment.\n\nTherefore, in the field of nephropathy treatment, umbilical cord MSC has greater potential for application.\n\nThis study was a prospective, single center, randomized controlled and double-blind study, total duration 36 months, of which each patient study cycle is 13 months, and long-term safety follow-up is 12 months after the end of the study. It is grouped by the random number table method, divided into the experimental group and the control group according to the ratio of 1:1, 22 people were required in the experimental group and 22 people in the control group, for a total of 44 people. Experimental group will receive UC-MSC, while the control group will receive saline solution. The expected effect is UC-MSC can delay the progression of renal function in patients with brady nephropathy,reduced or alleviated chronic kidney disease-related complications (e.g., anemia, hypertension)."

                              "Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (uc-MSC).\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design."

Several studies have shown that the immune system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and umbilical-cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via its immunomodulatory properties have the potential to improve insulin resistance condition and pancreatic beta-cells dysfunction thus improve the glycemic control and insulin requirement in T2D patients. In this pilot study, we plan to recruit 15 T2D patients with total daily dose of insulin >= 0.5 unit/kgBW/day to receive BM-MNCs (5 subjects) or UC-MSCs injections (10 subjects).

                              "Research Methods Study Design This study is an experimental one arm study post test only. Estimated Study Time Research estimated time would be 24 months, from May 2014 to May 2016. Sample Gaining Procedure This research is a pilot study. Samples are obtained consecutively from all source population that meet the criteria. The number of samples from each mesenchymal stem cell ( adipose, bone marrow and umbilical cord) source are three. Each samples derived from three different donors that met the inclusion criteria. For the implanation, the subjects are five from each intervention. Yet regarding the limited funding source and time, we will recruit one subject for each kind of MSC.\n\nSubject Criteria Inclusion criteria for MSC donor\n\nBone marrow donor :\n\nMale/female aged 19-30 year without any comorbiditites (Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and any other autoimmune disease), HIV test Hepatitis B test and Hepatitis C test are negaitve, no fungal and bacterial contamination in the bone marrow. Subjects are willing to be aspiratied in the iliac crest in order to get the bone marrow.\n\nAdipose donor :\n\nAdipose tissue are gained from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure. Samples of adipose are free from HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nUmbilical cord donor :\n\nUmbilical cord are form elective seccio caecaria from a fullterm mother without any complications and free from HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and no fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nRecipient inclusion criteria Critical bone defect patients aged 6-55 who are willing to undergo surgical intervention.\n\nRecipient exclusion criteria Patients with pathological fracture caused by malignancy, immunocompromised ( HIV AIDS, Diabetes mellitus, active Hepatitis), in a immunosuppresant therapy ( chemotherapy or steroids).\n\nDrop out criteria Patients are ruled out from this study if he/she stated to do so in the time this research are held or she/he undergoes any other threatment that are not related to this study. Patient who does not show any clinical improvement in three consecutive months is categorized as failed to threat. All drop out and failed to threat patient could get other threatment.\n\nInformed Consent All subjects must fill and sign in the informed consent letters.\n\nResearch Protocol Mesenchymal stem cell taking method Bone Marrow taking Patient is lying down in supine position, anesthetized locally. Aseptic and antiseptic are done in the illiac crest location. Aspiration needle is inserted 450 to horizon in illiac crest. Hub is released and a 10 cc syringe that contain heparin is connected to te needle. We aspirated about 50 cc bone marrow from each subject.\n\nUmbilical cord taking Right after the delivering the baby, the umbilical cord are cut and kept in a sterile bowl containing 0.9% NaCl in 40 until the sample is proceed.\n\nAdipose taking Adipose tissue are derived from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure. It is kept in a sterile bowl containing NaCL 0.9% in 40 C. Processing of the sample is done within 8 hours after sample are taken.\n\nCryopreservation and re activation. All the samples are taken to culture laboratory in integrated service of stem cell medical technology Cipto mangunkusumo hospita.this laboratory is GMP (good manufacturing Product) certified. The samples ate cultured in appropriated medium until it reach confluence and harvested. The cells then undergo caracterisation test by flow cyto meter and viability and numbers are counted. Some of the cells then cryopreserved while some are directly implanted into patient. The cells are cryopreserved for three months and then reactivated. Viability and numbers then are measured. The cells then are implanted to non union patient.\n\nSpecimen sterility Sterility tests are done three times to ensure there is no fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nHA-CaSO4 and MSC For every centimeter of defect, 10 millions cells and 50 pellet HA-CaSO4 are needed. The diluted MSC then mix with the HA-CaSO4 and incubated 5 minutes before implanted.\n\nIntervention Surgical intervention is needed to assemble the fixation device in the long bone. During the surgery, pellet HA-CaSO4 are inserted into the defect. After soft tissue are closed the rest of the serum is injected into the defect area.\n\nObservation and follow up Clinical and radiological follow up is done every 4 weeks. Observation is done for 12 months or untill the bone unites. Every subject will be followed up in the third, sixth, twelfth and twenty forth or until the fixation device is taken off.\n\nRecipient criteria for non union fracture"

                              "Liver transplantation is the only lifesaving intervention for patients with end-stage liver diseases. The current immunosuppressive agents reduce the incidence of acute cellular rejection; however, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term side effects of these regimens now has become a major challenge for liver transplant recipients and is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need, for example, increases in the incidence of bacterial, viral infections, nephrotoxicity with chronic renal impairment, de novo diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurotoxicity, hematological toxicity.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Current clinical trails demonstrated that the use of autologous bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) for renal transplanted patients resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function. Compared with BM-MSC, umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) may be the better choice for clinical application. One main reason is that the collection of BM-MSC from liver transplanted patients would be harmful for the patients. Moreover, the proliferative abilities of BM-MSC from patients with liver disease are deficient, whereas, UC-MSC can be obtained from discarded umbilical cords and can be produced on a larger scale. Our and other studies reported that the infusion of human UC-MSC are feasible and can improve liver function of liver fibrosis and liver failure.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the conditions in liver transplanted patients. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in liver transplanted patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus UC-MSC treatment. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus placebo. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After UC-MSC transfusion, patients are followed up at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and the evaluation of liver function recovery was performed."

                              "Since December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\nHuman and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the \"New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)\", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases. Early research in this laboratory used UC-MSCs to intervene in endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice, and confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect mouse lung tissue from endotoxin-induced damage.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This trial will recruit 48 patients. 24 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (4 times) of 5.0*10E6 cells/kg of UC-MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 24 patients received conventional treatment were used as control group. The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days to 96 weeks follow up."

The umbilical cord is one of the important sources of MSC. Human UC-MSC compared with the bone marrow-derived MSC has the following advantages: (1) the umbilical cord, as a \"waste\" after giving birth can be obtained without any harm to the donor. (2) easy available, and no ethical issues. (3) its likelihood of contamination is small because of the protection of the placental barrier. (4) human UC-MSC has a stronger amplification capacity, a shorter doubling time, a higher colony forming efficiency and lower immunogenicity. (5) which avoids the activity and differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSC latent with the donor disadvantage of increasing age decreased.\n\nhuman UC-MSC not only for hematopoietic stem cell graft implantation and amplification has a role in promoting and exhibit immunomodulatory effects and characteristics of damaged or targeted sites of chronic inflammation. human UC-MSC in the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced organ transplantation immune tolerance and other fields has broad application prospects.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of exploration, the investigators and other practitioners caught studies found that the umbilical cord is more suitable as mesenchymal stem cells seed cells relative to the bone marrow, umbilical cord easily obtained, no ethical issues, better amplification ability in vitro, viral contamination risk is small, and many other advantages. Therefore, over the years, the investigator team for the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in a lot of the basic work has been confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells derived from the umbilical cord had safety and effectiveness in in the treatment of acute graft versus host disease in zoology test, and successfully establish a perfect umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in standard operating procedures (including screening umbilical cord, large-scale preparation, quality inspection, preservation, recovery, transportation, infusion, etc.).

Children ages 2-5 years with cerebral palsy due to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, or periventricular leukomalacia may be eligible to participate. All participants will ultimately be treated with an allogeneic cell product at some point during the study. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms: (1) the \"AlloCB\" arm will receive one allogeneic CB infusion at the baseline visit; (2) the \"MSC\" arm will receive three hCT-MSC infusions, one each at baseline, three months, and six months; (3) the \"natural history\" arm will not receive an infusion at baseline but will receive an allogeneic CB infusion at 12 months. Motor outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, six-months, and one-year time points. Safety will be evaluated at each infusion visit and remotely for an additional 12 months after the final visit. Duration of study participation will be 24 months from the time of baseline visit. Randomization to treatment arms will be stratified by GMFCS level at study entry and etiology of CP (Stroke vs. Other)."

This study will be concluded in 2 months, from May to July 2020, from subject selection to the end of follow up. Research subjects are obtained consecutively from Covid-19 patients who receive care in the intensive care unit (ICU) across four Covid-19 referral hospitals, including Persahabatan Hospital, Sulianti Saroso Center for Infectious Disease, Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, and Universitas Indonesia Hospital, with 10 subjects obtained from each hospital and total 40 subjects for this RCT. Subjects from each hospitals are divided into control and experimental groups. Subject belongs to the control group will receive standardized therapy (consisting of oseltamivir and azithromycin), whereas subjects in the experimental group will receive MSCs infusion, in addition to standardized therapy.\n\nSubject Criteria Inclusion Criteria for MSC Donor from Umbilical Cord:\n\nUmbilical cord is collected from elective caesarean section from a fullterm pregnancies without any complication and free from HIV, Hepatitis B, C, D virus, Cytomegalovirus, Rubella Virus, and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nInformed consent all of the subjects must be filled and signed up before ruled in this study.\n\nAs soon as after delivery, the umbilical cord is collected and processed in sterile specimen 0,9% NaCl at 4oC for 8 hours. The umbilical cord transported to the laboratory and cultured in GMP lab, at Stem Cells Medical Technology Integrated Service Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Cellular viability and proliferation are evaluated after cell characterization test by flow cytometer.\n\nSterility tests are done three times to ensure cellular sterility. Subjects will receive MSCs through infusion through intravenous for 1 hour, following the administration of diphenhydramine and anticoagulant to prevent clotting.\n\nFollowing the MSCs administration, monitoring at the patients is carried out every day, whereas laboratory testing for basic parameters (complete blood count, differential count, blood gas analysis, C-reactive protein, SGOT/SGPT (AST/ALT), Ureum/Creatinine, eGFR, electrolyte, procalcitonin, albumin, total bilirubin, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, troponin I and proBNP) are carried out every three days. Cytokine levels are measured before the administration and 7th day after the administration. Chest radiography is carried out every three days."

                              "The curative potential of Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), when applied as a therapy in the management of hematologic malignancies, specifically, derives from an immunologically driven, graft-versus-tumor effect mediated principally by donor T-cells, and is associated with a lesser risk for relapse when compared to high dose chemo-radio therapy and autologous HCT. Donor derived T-cells are also responsible for mediating the occurrence of GVHD, a common transplant-related complication, affecting a significant percentage of patients undergoing allo-HCT leading to the destruction of host tissues. The standard initial treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD is steroid-based therapy. Unfortunately, many of these patients will become resistant to steroid therapy and will subsequently be treated with second-line immunosuppressive agents. De novo high-risk aGVHD and steroid-refractory aGVHD portends a very poor prognosis; second-line agents frequently prove ineffective, and as a result, survival is < 10% at 5 years. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed to treat aGVHD following allo-HCT, particularly in the setting of de novo high-risk acute or steroid-resistant disease.\n\nDue to the large numbers of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that can be obtained from the umbilical cord, the availability of this tissue, their higher growth rates and expansion capacity, and their immune properties, including: (1) low immunogenicity and lack of stimulation of allogeneic T-lymphocyte proliferation, (2) suppression of the proliferation of activated T-lymphocytes, (3) increased production of regulatory T-cells, and (4) a shift in the immune response towards tolerance, Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSC) may be a preferred option for MSC.\n\nThe rationale for cell dosing in this protocol is based on published data from Kebriaei, et al. Dosing at 2 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight produced a complete response in 87.5% of the treated patients. Dosing at a level 4 times higher (8 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight) produced no improvement in complete response results. However, the higher dose produced some partial response and no patient failed to respond to therapy. Therefore, the Phase I study for MSCTC-0010 is designed to increase the dose of WJMSC from 2 \u00d7 10^6 MSC to 10 \u00d7 10^6 MSC/kg body weight, assuming no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at the lower dose."

However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems. Since current therapeutic options for LF that is usually with extremely poor prognosis are still limited, recent studies indicate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their function in immune modulation and liver-damage repair, are of great therapeutic potential for this disease. Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) replace hepatocytes in injured liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration.The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and initial efficacy of human umbilical cord MSC (UC-MSCs) treatment for patients with LF. In this study, MSCs were isolated from umbilical cord and generated in appropriate growth medium. 50 LF patients with LF received i.v. transfusion of 0.5-1.0\u00d7106 cells/kg of MSCs as the treated group and other 20 LF patients with LF were transfused with placebo without MSCs as control group. All 70 of them received the routine management for liver failure. During the 2-year follow up, the evaluation of safty and efficacy will be undergone to help to establish innovative cell-based therapies for the treatment of diseases."

                              "One of the hallmark features of the progression of COVID-19 is lung injury from the viral infection leading to potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. In patients who survive ARDS, regardless of the pathology, there is evidence that their long-term quality of life is adversely affected.\n\nThe rationale for the dose and dosing regimen proposed in this study is based on the safe administration and benefits of this treatment regimen reported to us last year by physicians trying to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. In those reports, the intravenous route of administration was used. It has been reported that dosing every 2 days amplified the benefit of the combination of exosomes and mesenchymal stem cells. It has been suggested based on clinical experience that the exosomes and MSCs are complementary to one another as well as enhancing the innate abilities of both.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, intravenous infusion of a mixture of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 was reported to benefit hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 related ARDS. This study is designed to systematically explore the risk and benefits of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS.\n\nThis is a proof of concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122, versus placebo, for use in the treatment of moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19. This is an add-on treatment study; subjects will be allowed to take standard of care treatments available.\n\nThe study will have two arms (n=10 each):\n\nExperimental/treatment arm: EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 plus standard care\nPlacebo: Cryopreservation media plus standard care\n\nThe study duration would be 5 days of treatment plus 12 weeks follow up."

                              "Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.\n\nThe most popular form of autologous MSC therapy has been through the use of autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate (MSCs, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a \"healing\" effect on the environment in which it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\n\nAdipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of MSCs versus that in bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known as stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.\n\nAlthough the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and \"dose\" have not been performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized study arms with different types of MSCs (bone marrow derived MSC, adipose derived MSC, and umbilical cord tissue MSC) and then will be further randomized to receive an injection of the MSC type they were initially assigned to or corticosteroid. Participants randomized to bone marrow derived MSC or adipose derived MSC will undergo a procedure (bone marrow aspiration or liposuction). Participants will be blinded to whether they receive the MSC or corticosteroid injection."

                              "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier between photoreceptor cells and choroidal blood vessels. Photoreceptor cells are vitally and functionally dependent on the RPE. The conversion of blood glucose to ATP, synthesis of proteins in the visual cycle and removal of metabolic waste takes place in the RPE. For these important processes, various peptide growth factors and their receptors are synthesized in the RPE. More than 260 genes in the RPE are responsible for the production of these peptide fragments. Mutations in any of these genes as well as ischemic, physical or chemical RPE damage causes retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration may be inherited, such as in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Stargardt's disease, choroideremia, Best vitelliform dystrophy and Bietti's crystalline dystrophy. Retinal degeneration may also be acquired through genetic mechanisms, such as age-releated macular degeneration. In retinal degeneration, there is a developing loss of RPE and photoreceptors, regardless of the underlying cause.\n\nUmbilical cord Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) have significant paracrine and immunomodulatory properties. WJ-MSCs secrete trophic factors that stimulate RPE or secrete trophic factors that are similar to those produced by RPE. In studies using animal models, WJ-MSCs have been found to be effective in stopping the progression of retinal degeneration and for rescuing photoreceptors in the dormant phase. WJ-MSCs are hypoimmunogenic and have significant immunomodulatory properties. WJ-MSCs have been shown to suppress chronic inflammation and prevent apoptosis in animal models of neurodegenerative and ischemic retinal disorders. WJ-MSCs also stimulate progenitor cells in the retina and elicit self-repair mechanisms.\n\nThe aim of this preliminary clinical study is to investigate the ef\ufb01cacy of deep sub-tenon injected WJ-MSCs as a stem cell treatment modality for the management of retinitis pigmentosa, which creates outer retinal degeneration. These functional and structural effects were investigated using microperimetry, electrophysiology and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective clinical study that utilizes a large number of RP cases, and cases that are in phase-3."

                              "As with other major joints of the lower limb that carry weight (hip, knee), the osteochondral lesion (LOC) of the talus, can be a major source of pain and disability for the affected patient. The LOC of the talus can appear after one (or repeated) traumatic injury, compromises the bone and adjacent cartilage, being able to cause blisters in the cartilage layers, lesions similar to a cyst within the bone under the cartilage, or fracture of the cartilage and the bony layers.\n\nThe ankle joint supports multiple loads of the corporal weight in the daily activities, the reason why the properties of the cartilage in the ankle are different from those that appear in the hip and the knee. In the absence of an injury, the cartilage of the ankle has better resistance and tension properties to face the increase of forces than the hip or knee throughout life.\n\nHowever, once an injury appears, the cartilage of the ankle appears to have less repair capacity compared to the hip or knee. Since the most common cause of LOC of the talus is post-traumatic, the average age of these patients is comparatively lower than that of patients affected by injuries to other joints.\n\nOsteochondral injuries have an incidence of 27 per 10,0000 inhabitants in the USA. They are injuries that usually affect the working population and active sportsperson, producing pain, functional limitation and that probably contribute towards the evolution of an accelerated joint degeneration. Currently, there are multiple treatment modalities used by ankle and foot surgeons. These include debridement and microfractures of the subchondral plaque, utilization of totipotential cells, osteochondral autograft/allograft, tibiotalar arthrodesis, and partial/total ankle arthroplasty. However, no treatment offers a clear superiority over the others.\n\nDebridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically is the most frequently used procedure and involves; the removal of degenerated cartilage and subchondral bone; obtaining firm lesional edges that prevent the spread of the lesion; and finally the stimulation of the bone marrow talar by performing microfractures of the subchondral plate. This with the hope that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Although this fibrocartilage has histological characteristics different from those of native articular cartilage, good results have been reported in 82% of the cases when combining good quality studies in this regard.\n\nThe standard technique is not able to generate a replacement articular cartilage strong enough to support the joint loads to which the ankle is exposed. Therefore, clinical trials seek to increase the traditional treatment of debridement and microfractures with the intra-articular use of totipotent cells at the end of the procedure. Although the results of these series are promising and comparable at least to those of traditional treatment, the absence of comparative studies between them complicates the choice of treatment for both the patient and the surgeon. For this reason, the investigators have designed a prospective, comparative, double-blind study that will allow elucidating which of these interventions is the best alternative for our patients.\n\nGeneral Objective:\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogenic stromal mesenchymal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nTo compare functional and radiological results before versus post-surgery within each group studied (control and experimental)\nTo compare functional results after surgery of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\nTo compare the quality of repair of the tissues of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\n\nWork hypothesis:\n\nThe augmentation treatment of the osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal cells produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with only debridement and microfractures."

The result of a survey of 5 regions in Southeast Asia showed that 39-72% of patients with DPN had severe or very severe impact on their quality of life. For the treatment of DPN, conventional drug therapy can almost only target a single pathogenesis and cannot treat it fundamentally. Therefore, new safe and effective treatment options for DPN are particularly important.\n\nBoth here and abroad, large number of experimental studies have shown that Bone Marrow or Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells have a significant therapeutic effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In 2012, the Department of Endocrinology of Wuhan Central Hospital took the lead in conducting a clinical study of Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells in the treatment of DPN in China. The results of the study showed that the nerve conduction velocity of the lower extremities in most patients was improved within 3 months after treatment compared with before treatment. No serious adverse events occurred during the period. Based on this research of our own. The clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN.\n\nThe investigators will do a Single center, randomization, open trial, controlled clinical trials design to assess treatment with the MSCs compared with the control group. 42 patients with DPN will be recruited in China. 21 patients receive i. m. HUC-MSCs both lower extremities (5 \u00d7 10^6 cells/mL, 1 mL per injection, each injection point is 2 cm apart ,1.0-1.5 cm deep, total amount of injection is estimated based on the surface area of the patient's lower limbs). 21 patients in the control group received i.v.

Traditional treatments have some limitations whereas preclinical data suggest that stem cell therapy is a promising regenerative medical treatment given the limited capacity of the central nervous system for self-repairs after ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that umbilical cord blood-derived Mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusion improves the outcomes of several neurological damage conditions, including stroke. These results encouraged us to initiate the phase I/II clinical trial aiming to evaluate the safety and the efficiency of UC-MSC transplantation in the treatment of patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke. This case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between 2021 and 2023. In this trial, 48 patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke will be enrolled into 3 groups: UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route group (16), UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal administration route group (16), and control group (16). The UC-MSC group (IV/intrathecal) will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x106 cells/kg patient body weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be measured using these scales including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-NIHSS, Functional Independence Measure -FIM, Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS, Fine motor skills-FMS, 36-Item Short Form Survey -SF-36. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months post-intervention."

                              "A randomized, multicenter, single-blinded phase III trial will be conducted to assess whether the intracoronary infusion of umbilical cord WJ-MSCs demonstrates a superior effect in reducing HF incidence following AMIs compared to standard treatment.\n\nThe sample size was determined with a 5% error, 80% power, a one-year HF incidence rate of 1.3-4%, and division between two groups in a 2:1 ratio (control:intervention), and a three-year follow-up period.\n\nA total of 360 patients with a history of an anterior ST-elevation MI (STEMI) successfully reperfused within standard golden time within 3-7 days after AMI will be enrolled.\n\nRandomization will be done via permuted block randomization through a web-based service. A block size of 4 will be considered. Two groups of equal proportion will be formed, where only one will receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs besides the conventional therapy provided to both groups. Those who assess the study outcomes will remain unaware of the allocation (single-blind).\n\nThis study will use cGMP-certified clinical-grade human WJ-MSCs (Cell Tech Pharmed Co. Ltd., Tehran, Iran).In the intervention group, all 120 patients will receive a single intracoronary infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs alongside the conventional treatment that will be provided to the same number of patients in the control group. Patients in the intervention group will be taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where the infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs will be done through the intracoronary route.\n\nBefore statistical analysis, adjudication of all measurements will be done by an experienced cardiology department member excluded from the research group. The adjudicator will assess the quality of each measurement and will exclude those with inadequate quality from the analysis, where they will be regarded as missing. An independent, blinded safety committee will evaluate potential major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Once the adjudication process is complete, the finalized database will be unblinded.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group. Treatment efficacy will be assessed according to the decrement in HF with the help of Cox regression analysis. The investigators will consider the EF to have improved significantly if a minimum increment of 3% is achieved after six months. The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat approach. The baseline characteristics of the two study groups will also be compared. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation, while frequencies and percentages will be given for categorical data. The EF, as the primary outcome, will be compared between the study groups using the independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The therapeutic effect will be estimated with a 95% CI. Two-sided P-values will be used. Safety will be compared between the two groups according to the occurrence of MACEs (death, recurrent AMI, ICD insertion, non-target vessel revascularization, etc.) and serious adverse events (SAEs). These events will be followed over time with Kaplan-Meier curves, which will allow us to understand their patterns. With the help of the Cox proportional hazards model, The investigators will assess the statistical significance and 95% CI.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group.

The DSMB will have the authority to stop the trial early if patient safety is compromised or if the primary research objective is met. All safety issues (unanticipated SAEs, mortality, intracoronary infusion complications, and severe arrhythmias, etc.) will be monitored by the DSMB, and the DSMB statistician will report the occurrence of safety issues in each study group quarterly. All deaths will be reported.\n\nThe investigators have discussed all ethical issues with the Institutional Review Board of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, which ultimately approved the study protocol (IR.SUMS.REC.1400.409). Informed consent will be obtained once patients are clinically stable and sedatives or strong analgesics do not alter their consciousness. Importantly, the use of low balloon inflation pressure and divided (three-part) infusions will prevent complications related to intracoronary cell infusion. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki will be upheld throughout this study."

Safety assessments include monitoring of acute infusion reactions, adverse events, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization. Clinical outcome measures will also be described. A key clinical outcome measeure is the change in social communication abilities from baseline to 6 months based on the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI), a commonly-used and well-validated coding system for rating the quality and quantity of social communication skills in toddlers with and without ASD.91 JERI coding rates social communication abilities on a 1 to 7 scale and factors in both the quantity and quality of skills. The total joint engagement score as well as ratings on all JERI subscales that comprise the total score will be described.\n\nOther clinical endpoints will include the PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) autism composite score, the mean of the Socialization Subscale Standard Score and Communication Subscale Standard Score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) - Severity and Improvement Scales, the Communicative Development Inventories (CDI-2): Words & Sentences subscales, attention abilities via eye-tracking, and brain activity.\n\nExploratory clinical endpoints will include autism symptoms measured by an app that elicits and records autism symptoms on an iPad (SenseToKnow), Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) Calibrated Severity Score (overall, social affect, and repetitive behavior), PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) Subscales, and VABS-3 Standard Score and age equivalent for the following subscales: Socialization, Communication, and Daily Living and the Standard Score and age equivalent for the VABS-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite.\n\nSafety and VABS-3 assessments will also be conducted remotely at three and 12 months.

MSCs will be derived from healthy donor umbilical cord cells and 1 dose of MSCs will be tested. MUSC has a good manufacturing practice (GMP) quality Clean Cell Facility to ensure the quality and safety of the MSCs prior to infusing into study participants. The goal of this study is to determine the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.\n\nThe MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually located in the arm or hand. All participants will receive standard of care and their safety will be monitored throughout the study."

Patients were recruited into three different dose groups, and 12 subjects were enrolled in each group. The subjects of each group will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, and 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg respectively. According to the principle of dose escalation, subjects preset to low-dose will receive the administration first. Each group will receive only one corresponding dose for safety and tolerability check. The subjects will be observed for 21 days after the initial dose due to limited proliferation or differentiation potential and relatively low immunogenicity of mesenchymal stem cell products. The safety measures will be discussed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether subjects who have received a single dose will proceed with subsequent injections. Once all subjects in the lower-dose group have completed the initial administration and observed for 21 days. The DSMB will decided whether to proceed with the next-dose group. All subjects will receive routine drug treatment during the study. Primary endpoint: incidence and severity of cell therapy related adverse events from the beginning of treatment to the end of the follow-up. Secondary end point of the study includes: the change in Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of the subjects from baseline, at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; the overall survival rate at the 12th month after the last administration; Changes in liver function compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; changes of child Pugh score compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; and the change of Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) score from baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration."

                              "Allergic rhinitis (AR), is a noninfectious inflammatory disease of nasal mucosa mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody and involved in a variety of immune active cells and cytokines after the atopic body is exposed to allergens. The incidence of allergic rhinitis increases as people's living standards improves. It is estimated that about 1.4 billion people worldwide have been affected by the disease. Some patients with moderate to severe AR have no improvement in symptoms after drug treatment, which continues to affect daily life and work. Therefore, these patients urgently needs a new, minimally invasive, effective and simple treatment. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the mesoderm, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat and other cells. MSCs can also secrete a variety of bioactive molecules, which have the effects of regulating immunity and anti-inflammatory. Based on its immunomodulatory effect, MSCs is gradually becoming a new star in the treatment of allergic diseases. In pre-clinical studies on the treatment of AR, MSCs have shown good therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThis study is a prospective, open, single-center clinical study. Participants were recruited into three different dose groups. The cohort size of each dose group was 6 participants. The subjects of each group each will receive one course of treatment with a single injection. Subjects of group 1 will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 2 will receive 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg; with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 3 will receive 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs. One month after each injection, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will comprehensively evaluate the results of the phased clinical research, and after determining the safety and feasibility of the research, the enrollment of the next phase will start. The subjects will be followed up on the 3rd day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the treatment. The main outcome measures are the severity and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcome measures are RQLQ score, VAS score, serum inflammatory factor detection, nasal secretion inflammatory factor detection, nasal function test and nasal endoscopy, etc. In addition, the investigators will also monitor safety indicators such as blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, immunological indicators, tumor markers, etc. At the end of the study, according to the data obtained, the clinical safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of UCMSCs in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent AR will be evaluated, so as to provide drug dose basis for the next stage of clinical research."

                              "A Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a treatment in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by COVID-19 is a pilot phase, open label, non-randomized study, with a single study center.\n\nThe current pandemic caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a health care crisis affecting hospitals, hospital workers and health care structure globally. Many countries are dealing with a disrupted infrastructure in health care and imminent economic downfall to an extent that has not been seen in recent years. COVID-19 has lead to a large number of deaths in several countries, and Mexico has not been an exception. Availability of supplies, hospital space and equipment for mechanical ventilation are running critically low, and it has been a challenge for hospitals coping with severe clinical symptoms in COVID-19. This disease is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough and occasional diarrhea, and the severity has been largely attributed to the high affinity of the virus to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main receptor, and the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease TMPRSS2 as the main host protease that mediates S protein activation on primary target cells in the lung and small intestine.\n\nMany agencies and professional societies are working worldwide in developing treatment guidelines to care for patients with COVID-19, since the present treatments are supportive but not yet curative, therefore these guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion, the use of an array of drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents that are being studied. Lately, Remdesivir, a novel small-molecule adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys has shown improvement in patients with oxygen support. The focus of the research for a cure of COVID-19 has been centered on the individual's response in an immunological context, where an over activation of the immune response can cause a production of a large quantity of inflammatory molecules resulting in a cytokine storm with severe physiological consequences. The cytokine storm induces an increase in inflammatory proteins that results in edema, improper oxygen exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other organ damage and secondary infection. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have proven to decrease the hyper inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to a steady recovery in patients with ARDS. The use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) may prove a potential effective measure for the treatment of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19.\n\nA step forward in a treatment strategy for the novel virus infection in humans would be critical for treating COVID-19 and especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently depleting resources around the world. Because efforts to control lung injury via pharmacological agents have been unsuccessful, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is being investigated, based on the characteristics of MSCs to self-renew in a limitless manner and their multipotency.\n\nFurthermore, MSC-based therapies have demonstrated in the past of having sufficient promising effects in experimental treatment of ARDS via inhibition of alveolar collapse, collagen accumulation, and cell apoptosis in lung tissue. Recent studies found that administrating allogeneic MSCs in patients with ARDS resulted in no pre-specified adverse events, including hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia. MSCs are currently attracting interest due to source potential, a high proliferation rate, and a painless procedure that is free of ethical issues. Selection of a starting dose of approximately 100 million cells has been chosen to approximate the standard dosage of cells employed in prior clinical studies. This dosage may be adjusted depending on the data generated during the conduction of the study.\n\nMSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are triggered further by the activation of TLR receptor in MSCs, which is stimulated by pathogen-associated molecules such as LPS or double-stranded RNA from virus, like the HCoV-19.\n\nThere are many pilot studies conducted with MSC transplantation to explore their therapeutic potential for HCoV-19 infected patients, in many of them the pulmonary function and symptoms of patients were significantly improved days after MSC transplantation. Thus, in this study we intend to prove the intravenous transplantation of MSCs as safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for patients in severe condition.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the feasibility and safety of intravenously administered MSCs in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess preliminary response in respiratory performance in patients with ARDS.\n\nTo assess overall survival of patients. To determine mortality rate at 14 days post treatment. To assess clinical and radiological improvements in patients.\n\nNumber of Subjects to be studied: 10\n\nEndpoints\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nEvaluate Respiratory distress symptoms based on Berlin definition (RR; Oxygen saturation at rest; Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / Fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2)).\n\nDetermine the degree of ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration in imaging studies (X-ray or CT).\n\nEvaluate clinical improvement based on APACHE II Score. Determine mortality rate at 2 weeks post treatment.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nAdverse events related to MSC infusion (description, timing, grade, seriousness, and relatedness) Hematological decompensation (based on CBC, SQ and metabolic panels) Objective response rate Progression free survival, overall survival, and best overall response rate Determine if any infusion reactions/toxicity occurs\n\nClinical and radiological parameters will be assessed at Baseline, 2, 4 and 14 day post-treatment, and there will be a 3 month follow-up by telephone contact."

                              "Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. BM-MSC has also been used to treat human liver diseases such as liver failure and liver cirrhosis. In a phase 1 study, autologous BM-MSC transplantation has potential to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can improve the longer term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well BM-MSC is tolerated and its safety in LC patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times UC-MSC treatment at 4-week intervals.\n\nArm B: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times saline infusions at 4-week intervals.\n\nUC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are infused intravenously. After cell therapy, patients are followed up for 75 months. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin(PA), the rountin blood test are detected at week 12, 24, 48 timepoints. Clinical symptoms as well as complication were also observed simultaneously."

Today there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nExperimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and are found in all structural tissues of the body.\n\nIn the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.\n\nAmong the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017) that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial."

In each cohort, eligible patients will be randomized to the two treatment arms at the ratio of 3:1 (BX-U001: Placebo). The patients in the first cohort will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 0.75\u00d710^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. In the second cohort, the patients will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 1.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. After the one-time infusion on Day 1, patients will be monitored for 52 weeks. During the study, besides BX-U001 or placebo infusion, patients will remain treated with their previous conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than biologics) in the same dosage/way.\n\nAt the end of Week 12, the patients will undergo efficacy evaluations to determine their response to treatment using the response rate of American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20). For patients who lack response to treatment as defined by not achieving 20% improvement on tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at Week 12, they will receive standard of care treatment including csDMARDs, biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and adjunctive agents such as corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and analgesics at Week 14.\n\nThe overall study duration is planned to be 2 years."

                              "This is a prospective, open label, phase one study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSCs are manufactured from umbilical cord tissue donated by healthy mothers delivering full term babies via Cesarean Section. The cells are extracted from the cord tissue, expanded and cryopreserved (frozen). One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant in this study.\n\nIt is hypothesized that immune dysregulation and/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that adversely affects normal brain development may cause core symptomatology observed in individuals with ASD. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated a multitude of immunomodulatory effects which are thought to be carried out via paracrine and trophic signaling. While MSCs modulate the immune response, MSCs themselves have low immunogenicity (the body does not have a strong immune reaction against them) and they do not permanently engraft in the recipient.\n\nAdults ages 18 to less than 35 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will have a screening visit that includes clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD, cognitive abilities, ASD symptom level, and confirmation of eligibility.\n\nOne dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant at a baseline visit. Participants will be admitted to the infusion center on the day of their baseline visit and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate) will be measured. Participants may require some sedation prior to IV placement if requested. A peripheral IV will be placed and prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Solumedrol, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs product will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluid maintenance will be given. Participants will be discharged after 1 hour, providing all vital signs are at their baseline and they are asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity. Participants will be evaluated the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications. A phone call or email will be done to assess safety of the infusion 7-10 days after the infusion. Remote follow up will occur one year after infusion. Participants will return to Duke six months after infusion for repeated testing and safety follow-up. The Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire assessing adverse events will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 12-months.\n\nThe main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization will be assessed. Key secondary endpoints will include ASD-specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after product administration. Exploratory analyses will include measures obtained by EEG, eye-tracking, pupillary light reflex, computer vision analysis, and tactile stimulation."

                              "Liver cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by the formation and accumulation of an extracellular matrix, which leads to the progressive distortion of the hepatic architecture. In China, the most important cause of liver cirrhosis is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver cirrhosis usually progresses irreversibly into advanced stage, such as a decompensated stage which is characterized by a series of clinical manifestations, including ascites, variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy with high mortality. Liver transplantation is the only option that can improve the survival of these decompensated liver cirrhosis patients; however, this procedure is associated with several limitations, such as the severe shortage of donor livers, long waiting lists, multiple complications, and high cost. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nAnimal models have shown that bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) can ameliorate liver fibrosis and reverse fulminant hepatic failure. In clinical, autologous BM-MSC have significantly improved liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. A recent research also found that autologous BM-MSC therapy safely improved histological fibrosis and liver function in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Allogeneic MSC therapy, such as umbilical cord-derived MSC (UC-MSC), have shown to be safe and beneficial for the patients with liver cirrhosis caused by autoimmune diseases. Our previous studies showed that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients and increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients. However, the single-center clinical study, the relative small size of the patient cohorts, absence of evaluation on long-term efficacy prevent firm conclusions being made with regard to the safety and efficacy of this treatment in liver diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how UC-MSC can improve the liver function, and the incidence of serious complications in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a multi-center clinical study."

                              "Patients selection:\n\nIn this clinical trial, investigators considered therapeutic effect of MSCs in SM-exposed male patients.Patients, had a documented encounter with SM during the Iran-Iraq war. The patients signed informed consent before study. They were selected according to the following criteria: (a) the severity of lung injury was ranged from moderate 50< forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <65 to severe 40<FEV1<50; (b) absence of contraindications spirometry (hemoptysis, cerebral arterial aneurysm or aortic, pulmonary embolism, uncontrolled blood pressure, recent pneumothorax, no doubt surgery/thoracic recent, recent stroke); and (c) no coagulation. The exclusion criteria for the selection process were as follow: (a) participate in another study at the same time; (b) smoking habitat; (c) the existence of pneumonia during the study; (d) the incidence of transfusion reaction; (e) underlying other diseases (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes).\n\nIsolation and culture of adipose derived stem cells:\n\n200mL of abdominal adipose tissue was obtained under local anesthesia by liposuction aspirates protocol. The lipoaspirate was washed with PBS to remove tissue debris. 100mL PBS containing 0.1% w/v collagenase A type I was added to isolated tissue and then incubated at 37\u00baC for 60 minutes. Collagenase activity was neutralized using MEM medium along with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium after centrifugation at 2000rpm for 10 min, and then transferred to culture flasks for 72 h at 37\u00baC in 5% CO2 condition. The culture medium in the flasks was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged for two times.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis:\n\nTo analyze the cell surface antigen expression, 5\u00d7105 fresh cells from third passage were harvested by trypsin-EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 1 min, resuspended in stain buffer (PBS, 2% FBS) and then incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Trypsin was neutralized by centrifuge and isolated cells were washed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in stain buffer. Cells were incubated in dark environment for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cells were labeled with anti-human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugated to fluorochromes. These antibodies were as follow: anti-CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD73-phycoerythrin (PE), CD11b-FITC, CD34-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD45-PE, CD105-PE. The frequencies of all immunolabeled cells were analyzed by FACS Canto II flow cytometer, in which approximately 500,000 events were assessed and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0).\n\nKaryotype analysis for abnormalities detection:\n\nStandard Giemsa staining procedure was performed and chromosome preparations were obtained from 80% confluent cells. To stop microtubule formation, the cells were treated with Colcemid solution. The mitotic arrested cells were then harvested using trypsin-EDTA. The cells were extracted and then immersed in 75 mmol/l KCl for 30 minute at laboratory temperature. Finally, they obtained by a centrifugation. The supernatant was replaced with fixative solution and the suspension was spread over slides for microscopic examination and imaging. At least, 15 metaphase spreads were analyzed. The karyotypes were considered with light microscope using a cytovision software.\n\nFreezing and Storage of Adipose-derived Stem Cells:\n\nADMSCs were harvested at 90% confluence before injection for freezing. To collect cells, culture medium was removed and replaced with sterile PBS and after three minutes it was replaced with trypsin-EDTA solution and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Complete medium (MEM with 10% FBS) was added to inactivate the trypsin, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in cryopreservation medium (80% FBS, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 10% MEM medium) with a final concentration of 5 million cells per milliliter and aliquoted into cryovials. The vials stored at -80 \u00b0C overnight and then transferred into a liquid nitrogen container for long-term storage.\n\nMSCs injection and Study plan:\n\nPatients received 100\u00d7106 cells every 20 day for four injections within 2 months and screened for 7 times. MSCs were injected intravenously along with 300 ml normal saline to the patient at a maximum rate of 2\u00d7106 cells/min. Each infusion took approximately 30 minute to be completed. After each injection, patient stayed at hospital for at least 6h as recovery time. Efficacy of MSCs treatment in these patients were evaluated using the following parameters: pulmonary functions test (PFTs) [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC], total lung capacity by body plethysmography, single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (CO diffusion) , exercise performance [6-minute walk test (6MWT)], Borg scale dyspnea assessment (BSDA), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SRGQ) and comprehensive safety evaluation."

                              "Trauma is the leading cause of soft tissue loss of the heel. Children constitute the largest group of victims of such injuries. Spoke wheel injury, road traffic accident are common mode in the children. These injuries can range from simple minor abrasions, lacerations to crushing of heel. Injury to heel pad and flap has serious impact in day to day life, causing disability because it is the major weight bearing area and inherently lacks adequate soft tissue.\n\nManagement of injury of heel pad in children depends on severity and extent of soft tissue injury. Oestern and Tscherne have classified soft tissue injuries into four grades from 0-4. The treatment of Grade 0 and 1 injuries is typical cleansing and application of a moist wound healing dressing. But further grades need surgical management with debridement and reconstruction.\n\nGrade III and IV can be reconstructed by using graft, flaps or various other techniques. Simple skin graft, lateral rotational skin flap, local muscle flaps, ingenious fasciocutaneous island flaps, cross-leg or cross foot flap, free tissue transfer and staged or distant jumped flaps are historically included in reconstructive ladder in repairing these soft tissue injuries. Generally, free flap reconstruction is the ultimate step of degloving wound coverage. Despite availability of various reconstructive techniques, covering of soft tissue loss of heel in traumatic events, remains a difficult and demanding procedure, especially when it is associated with fractures and complex wounds. Skin grafting offers poor functional and cosmetic results, although it is commonly performed with good take rates.\n\nStem cells are potential alternative to promote cutaneous wound healing because of its unique features like self-renewal and differentiation capacity. Mesenchymal stem cells are type of adult stem cells that reside in various tissues of the body. Besides, these cells are preferred for cell based therapies because they have immunomodulatory properties. These cells can be isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue and human umbilical cord blood and tissue. Recently,umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells have shown a tremendous potential for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Previous studies indicate that these mesenchymal stem cells can accelerate wound healing by enhanced proliferation and migration of human fibroblast, enhancing secretion of elastin, synthesizing collagen, angiogenesis and further maturing blood vessels present in wound site. Stem cell-based therapies will definitely be the major part of clinical medicine in next decade.\n\nIn the current study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord with informed consent from the mothers. This study will open a new avenue for the treatment of heel pad injury. Considering the role of stem cells in wound healing, study has been designed to accelerate the wound healing process in children with heel pad injury. Since the use of stem cell (especially in Pakistan) is completely a new technique in the management of heel pad injury, it will provide insight for better management by accelerating the wound healing process, reducing the hospital stay and cost of treatment. Rationale of our study aims to compare outcome of heel pad injury managed with skin graft with infiltration of mesenchymal stem cell Versus management with skin graft only."

                              "Since late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic, more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48 patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other 24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment."

                              "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes. It is a persistent and refractory disease. There is currently a lack of effective clinical treatments for DN. The basic pathological processes of DN are renal tissue cell damage, apoptosis and continuous increase of inflammatory cytokines induced by early high glucose, which gradually leads to glomerular sclerosis and renal fibrosis.\n\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), as the \"youngest\" adult stem cells, have powerful anti-inflammatory functions, stronger differentiation potential, and good safety. They are ideal seed cells for the treatment of DN. At present, studies on a variety of animal models of DN have shown that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can delay the progression of DN and have a certain repair effect on damaged kidney tissue and renal function. Our previous preclinical study showed that UC-MSCs effectively improved the renal function, inhibited inflammation and fibrosis, and prevented its progression in a rat model of diabetes-induced chronic renal injury. Some autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been carried out abroad treatment of chronic kidney disease caused by various reasons, including clinical trials of DN, phase I/II test results did not show obvious adverse reactions related to stem cell therapy, and can improve the patient's renal function and quality of life to a certain extent.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating DN patients. This trial will recruit 38 patients. 19 patients received the treatment of conventional treatment + equal volume normal saline containing 1% human albumin (placebo group) were used as control group; conventional treatment + 1*10E6 UC-MSCs/kg body weight (experimental group) for intravenous infusion (once a week, 3 times in total) to treat 19 patients with DN (by unified standard inclusion), and subjects will be followed a total of 48 weeks from time of initial cell treatment."

                              "Frailty syndrome is the most problematic expression of population ageing and profound implications for the planning and delivery of health and social care when population ageing is accelerating rapidly worldwide, from 461 million people older than 65 years in 2004 to an estimated 2 billion people by 2050 . Frailty syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in health and clinical symptoms of exhaustion, weight loss, a feeling of slowing down, and a decrease in functional capacity. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that carries an increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Health study as meeting three out of five phenotypic criteria: low grip strength, self-reported exhaustion, slowed walking speed, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss. Frailty is a disorder of several inter-related physiological systems, including genetic and environmental factors in combination with epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate the differential expression of genes in cells and could be especially important in ageing. Current interventions focus on interdisciplinary approaches which include nutritional supplementation, physical exercise, and cognitive intervention. Clinical studies of these preventative approaches have shown inconsistent and modest benefits, further highlighting the unmet clinical need. Therefore, development of new therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of frailty syndrome in adult patients is of urgent need. A variety of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are currently being tested to treat aging. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are represents an attractive option that addresses the pathophysiology of the syndrome."

Patients with COPD are characterized with airflow limitation and chronic inflammation, which is caused by cigarette smoking, noxious particles or gases. These inhaled irritants will induce inflammation, emphysema and fibrosis though chronic exposure. The current pharmacological treatment of COPD is symptomatic and is mainly based on bronchodilators, such as selective \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (short-and long-acting), anticholinergics, theophylline, or a combination of these drugs. In patients with continuing exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) may be added in the form of a triple fixed dose combination inhaler that includes ICSs, long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABA) and inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Although current clinical treatment strategies can improve and stabilize COPD states and quality of life, none of them are able to modify the progressive decline in lung function which is the hallmark of this disease. Therefore, development of new therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COPD in adult patients is of urgent need.

Briefly, human umbilical cord tissues along with informed consent forms will be collected from COVID-19- and hepatitis B, C virus-negative women with healthy pregnancies during the Cesarean Section surgery after completion of gestation period. The umbilical cord tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing penicillin and streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with 4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15ml PBS. The cord will then gently scrap with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced pieces will be incubated in 17.5ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50ml conical tube for ~3 hrs in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37oC. After ~3 hrs, the digested lysate will be passed through strainer and will be diluted three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two T-25cm2 flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37o C. The flasks will be fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic solution) every third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will be transferred in two T-75cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UMSCs at P3 will be characterized using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be employed for injection in RP patients."

This is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one or two intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with moderate to severe HIE who are recipients of therapeutic hypothermia. Infants born at 36 0/7 weeks gestation or later who have moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are receiving therapeutic hypothermia will be eligible to participate. Investigators project an accrual of 6 patients. All infants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of hCT-MSCs. The first cohort of three infants will receive a single dose in the first 48 postnatal hours. If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three infants will receive two doses, with the first dose given in the first 48 postnatal hours and the second dose given approximately two months after the first dose.\n\nThe potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization. Another risk of this study is loss of confidentiality or privacy. Every effort will be made to keep the infant's medical record confidential. The results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and statistical testing as appropriate. Continuous secondary endpoints will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, CV%, median, minimum, and maximum."

                              "The cartilage is a unique avascular, aneural tissue that does not regenerate easily once damaged. Chondral defects or damages to articular cartilages due to accidents, necrosis of subchondral bone tissue, or arthritis have become some of the more common disorders today. About 15% of the world's population is reportedly suffering from cartilage and joint damages such as degenerative arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. As population aging progresses and as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of the target patient group is also growing. However, despite ongoing research, an effective treatment for cartilage defects is yet to be discovered. Various different types of treatments are currently in use, such as drug therapy, arthroscopy, and artificial joint surgery. However, they all fail to address the root cause. Complete treatment, or regeneration of damaged or defective cartilage is impossible and continuous drug administration or secondary surgeries are required in many cases.\n\nAs a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized damage to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few life science companies both home and abroad are marketing this method of treatment called 'autologous chondrocyte transplant'. The treatment involves the extraction of healthy cartilage tissue from the patient which is then cultured and transplanted into the damaged site.\n\nHowever, this treatment requires the extraction of chondrocytes directly from the patient and thus causes trauma in healthy articular cartilage. Also, this type of treatment cannot be applied to large lesions, nor is the efficacy satisfactory in patients over the age of 40 whose cellular activation levels are low. Thus, autologous chondrocyte transplant is rather limited in the number of cells harvested and their activation level and is therefore restricted in terms of treatment site, severity of the condition, and the size of lesion. The current technology allows the application of treatments in local cartilage defects but not in degenerative arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The technology needs to be taken up to another level in order to benefit such prevalent arthritic disorders. Treatments using stem cells do not cause damage to healthy articular cartilage as they don't require the harvesting of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients. Moreover, the number of successfully cultured cells is larger due to the excellent proliferation capability of stem cells and thus, mass supply is possible.\n\nThis clinical trial for the stem cell therapies is essential because treatment of cartilage defects with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, known to have the highest level of activity among all adult stem cells, opens the possibility of articular cartilage regeneration even for aged patients and patients with large lesions unable to benefit from existing treatments.\n\nThe biggest challenge faced by nations competing in the field of \"tissue differentiation and regeneration using stem cells\" is the question of whether or not the use of embryonic stem cells is ethical. Chondrogenesis using umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells can not only avoid similar challenges, but also present an innovative treatment mode with significant clinical implications for the patients.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured, mixed with semi- solid polymer, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery in order to stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

                              "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common type of arthritis diagnosed. KOA is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of articular cartilage. The prevalence of the Knee osteoarthritis will continue to increase as life expectancy and obesity rises. Osteoarthritis is typically a progressive disease that may eventually lead to disability. The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.\n\nThe rate of progression also varies for each individual. Common clinical symptoms include knee pain that is gradual in onset and worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain after prolonged sitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment for knee osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options when conservative treatment fails. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis currently exist. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of KOA."

Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient.

                              "Although HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency, a chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. In particular, this immune activation has been identified as a disease determinant independent of viral load or cell death in HIV-1 infection. A series of clinical evidences have indicated that activated CD8 T cells may attack body cells infected with viruses. Because of this, CD4 cells infected with HIV are frequently destroyed by CD8 cells.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the adult stem cells originating from the mesenchymal and connective tissue of bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord, cord blood, peripheral blood, liver, etc. These cells show immunomodulation, self-renewal, and multi-directional differentiation potential. In particular, MSCs have recently emerged as promising candidates for cell-based immunotherapy because they can modulate the immune response in various ways. A series of studies have indicated that secretion of dissoluble cytokines and direct contact with MSCs can block the development and functioning of antigen-presenting cells, inhibit the differentiation of B cells, and suppress the immune response of T cells and natural killer cells. The immunosuppressive effect of infused MSCs has been successfully employed in the treatment of acute severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, MSC may reduce inflammatory responses and promote tissue recovery in human diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn what dose of transfused MSC reduces the level of activation of CD8 cells in people infected with HIV. The decreased activation of CD8 cells may lead to a more CD4 T cell restoration in HIV infection. This study will also look at what dose of MSCs is tolerated and its safety in HIV- infected patients.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms:\n\nArm A:Participants will receive 48 weeks of low dose of MSC treatment followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nArm B:Participants will receive 48 weeks of high dose of MSC treatment followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nArm C: Participants will receive 48 weeks of saline placebo followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nStudy treatment will be given at 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 week since the onset of treatment. There will be an additional 48 weeks of follow-up for purposes of safety. After treatment has started, participants will be asked to come to the clinic on Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48,60,72,84 and 96. At each visit participants will receive enough study treatment to last until the next visit. Each visit will last between 2 and 3 hours. At most visits participants will have a physical exam, answer questions about any medications they are taking and how they are feeling, and have blood drawn for safety to assess CD4/CD8 cell counts and viral load. Some additional blood will also be stored for immunology testing. At some visits participants will be asked questions about their medication and medical history, have pupils dilated, have a hearing test, and have an electrocardiogram (EKG). Some visits will require participants to arrive fasting. Pregnancy tests may also be conducted if the participant is able to become pregnant or if pregnancy is suspected."

                              "The role of MSCs as a novel treatment in ARDS. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are a mononuclear cell population that have the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages, and bone, cartilage and adipocyte cells in particular. Cell-based therapies have been termed the \"next pillar of Medicine\". MSCs constitute an innovative approach with substantial therapeutic promise for ARDS. MSCs possess several favorable biological characteristics, including convenient isolation, ease of expansion in culture while maintaining genetic stability, minimal immunogenicity and feasibility for allogenic transplantation.\n\nMSCs reduce inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance during rodent and murine bacterial pneumonia, and augment repair of the animal and human lung. Large animal studies have also replicated these beneficial effects. Bone marrow derived (BM) hMSCs decreased acute lung injury (ALI), without producing organ toxicity, in endotoxin injured pigs. Two randomised small phase 1 studies of plastic adherent MSCs in patients with ARDS have taken place. In Japan, investigators used adipose-derived plastic adherent cells in a small cohort (n=12) of patients with ARDS randomized 1:1 to MSCs or placebo: showing that the cells were safe and well-tolerated in this patient group, and were associated with reduced plasma levels of the alveolar epithelial cell injury marker SP-D. In the US Matthay has completed the phase 1 START trial, using a dose escalation study of plastic adherent bone marrow derived MSCs, in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. START showed that marrow derived MSCs at similar doses to those proposed in this study are safe and well-tolerated, (n=9), with a trend to reduced lung injury in the group treated with the highest (10x10^6cells/kg) compared with the lower doses, 1-5x10^6cells/kg.\n\nCurrent (20 March 2020) data on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that it causes a mortality rate of ~3.4%, compared with <0.1% with seasonal influenza. ARDS occurs in approximatel 20% cases of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. In a restropective multi-centre study of 150 confirmed cases in Wuhan, China, ARDS occured in significantly greater proportion of non-survivors 81% (55/68 patients) compared with only 9% survivors (7/82 patients); p<0.01. In another study of 193 confirmed COVID-19 cases, ARDS was observed at a significantly higher rate in non-survivors 93% (50/54 patients) compared with survivors, 7% (9/137) patients; p<0.0001.\n\nDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, MSCs have been administered in a pilot study of seven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A single infusion of 1 x 10^6 MSCs were administered intravenously when their condition was considered to be deteriorating despite other treatments, however only 1 of the 7 patients required critical care and mechanical ventilation. 4 patients were described as severe with compromise of respiratory function. Patients underwent follow up for 14 days and no infusional toxicity or adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial design:\n\nThe phase 1 trial is an open label dose escalation pilot study in which cohorts of subjects with moderate to severe ARDS will receive increasing doses of a single infusion of Realist Orbcel-C in a 3+3 design. We initially plan 3 cohorts with 3 subjects/cohort. Planned doses for the 3 cohorts pending absence of safety concerns are 100 x 10^6 cells, 200 x 10^6 cells and 400 x 10^6 cells.\n\nIn the completed Phase 1 REALIST trial, infusion of 400 million cells was achieved without any dose limiting toxicity at day 7 and has been approved by the DMEC as the intervention for this study.\n\nThe phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, allocation concealed placebo-controlled study using the 400x10^6 cell dose of Realist Orbcel-C in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to either COVID-19 or other causes of ARDS.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo assess the safety of a single intravenous infusion of REALIST ORBCEL-C cells in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nIn patients with moderate to severe ARDS to determine the effect of a single intravenous infusion of REALIST ORBCEL-C cells on:\n\nPhysiological indices of respiratory dysfunction reflecting severity of ARDS, as measured by oxygenation index (OI), respiratory compliance, and P/F ratio.\nSequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.\nExtubation and reintubation\nVentilation free days at day 28\nDuration of ventilation\nLength of ICU and hospital stay\n28-day and 90-day mortality\n\nPopulation:\n\nPatients will be prospectively screened daily. All patients with moderate to severe ARDS will be entered into a screening log. If possible during the phase 2 trial, all patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes of ARDS will be entered into a screening log. If the patient is not recruited the reason will be recorded. A fully anonymised minimal dataset will be recorded on these patients (age, gender, APACHE II score, worst P/F ratio at time of assessment, reasons for non-enrolment and vital status). APACHE II score and vital status will be collected using anonymised linkage to the ICNARC database through a defined CMP number (or equivalent). This will allow comparison to identify that the study population is representative of the overall cohort of patients. This information is required to establish an unbiased study population and to ensure the study can be reported in keeping with CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org).\n\nPatient consent:\n\nInformed consent procedure:\n\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The chief investigator (CI) (or designee) is responsible for ensuring that informed consent for trial participation is given by each patient or a legal representative. An appropriately trained doctor or nurse may take consent. The person taking informed consent must be GCP trained, suitably qualified and experienced and have been delegated this duty on the delegation log. Appropriate signatures and dates must be obtained on the informed consent documentation prior to collection of trial data and administration of the trial drug. If no consent is given a patient cannot be randomised into the trial. The incapacitating nature of the condition precludes obtaining prospective informed consent from participants. In this situation informed consent will be sought from a Personal Legal Representative or Professional Legal representative.\n\nPersonal legal representative consent:\n\nInformed consent will be sought from the patient's personal legal representative (Per LR) who may be a relative, partner or close friend. The Per LR will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and provided with a copy of the covering statement for the Per LR with an attached participant information sheet (PIS) and asked to give an opinion as to whether the patient would object to taking part in such medical research. If the Per LR decides that the patient would have no objection to participating in the trial the Per LR will be asked to sign the Per LR consent form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the Per LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical records.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there are likely to be visiting restrictions in place due to infection control measures and therefore it may not be possible to obtain consent from the PerLR at the clinical site. If the PerLR is not available at the site, the research may contact the PerLR by telephone and seek verbal agreement. The verbal agreement will be recorded in the PerLR Telephone Agreement Form.\n\nProfessional legal representative consent:\n\nAs the patient is unable to give informed consent and no Per LR is available, a doctor who is not connected with the conduct of the trial may act as a professional legal representative (Prof LR). The doctor will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and given a copy of the PIS. If the doctor decides that the patient is suitable for entry into the trial that doctor will be asked to sign the professional legal representative consent form. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the Prof LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical records.\n\nRetrospective patient consent:\n\nPatients will be informed of their participation in the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team once the patient regain capacity to understand the details of the trial. The responsible clinician or a member of the research team will discuss the study with the patient and the patient will be given a copy of the PIS to keep. The patient will be asked for consent to participate in the trial and to sign the consent to continue form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the patient and another copy placed in the patients' medical records. Where consent to continue is not obtained, consent from the legal representative will remain valid. If the patient refuses consent, permission to use data collected to that point and to access medical records for trial data will be requested from the patient.\n\nWithdrawal of consent:\n\nPatients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by Per LR or Prof LR) from the trial at any time without prejudice.\n\nIn the event of a request to withdraw from the study, the researcher will determine which elements of the trial are to be withdrawn from the following possibilities and this will be documented:\n\nOrbcel-C administration if ongoing\nOn-going data collection during hospital admission\nConfirmation of vital status\nOn-going data collection following hospital discharge In the event that the request is to withdraw from all elements of the study, only anonymised data recorded up to the point of withdrawal will be included in the study analysis.\n\nConsent will also be requested to use the samples collected to that point.\n\nInvestigational medicinal product\n\nThe Investigational Medicinal Products are:\n\nAllogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as a sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension containing a fixed cell dose of either 100 x 10^6, 200 x 10^6 or 400 x 10^6 cells in 10mL, 20mL or 40mL volumes, respectively to be further diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for the purposes of administration.\nPlasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls) as the placebo control solution.\n\nStorage, thawing and reconstitution of Orbcel-C cells:\n\nTrial guidelines will provide detailed information regarding the protocol for storage, thawing and reconstitution, and administration of the cell product Orbcel-C and placebo.\n\nDrug storage:\n\nThe study drug will be commenced as soon as possible following reconstitution and within 6 hours.\n\nStudy drug termination criteria:\n\nStudy drug will be continued until one of the following is met:\n\nStudy drug related adverse event\nDeath or discontinuation of active treatment\nRequest from Per LR or Pro LR to withdraw the patient from the study\nDecision by the attending clinician on safety grounds.\n\nStudy drug compliance:\n\nAny omission of the study drug will be recorded in the CRF to monitor compliance.\n\nStudy drug accountability:\n\nThe site clinical trials pharmacist and cell therapy facility staff will maintain full accountability for the study drug received, prepared and dispensed to patients in ICU. Records will be kept allowing traceability between the cell donor and the IMP recipient. Drug administration will be recorded on the patient's prescription chart.\n\nStudy drug return and destruction:\n\nAny partially used study drug should be disposed of/destroyed at the site in accordance with Trial guidelines and local biological waste management policies.\n\nUnused product should disposed of/destroyed under the supervision of the site clinical trials pharmacist. Records of return and destruction will be maintained.\n\nData Quality:\n\nThe NICTU will provide training to site staff on trial processes and procedures including CRF completion and data collection. Within the NICTU the clinical data management process is governed by SOPs to ensure standardisation and adherence to International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements. Data is to be entered onto the electronic database as per the CRF entry timelines. On-site monitoring visits during the trial will check: (i) the accuracy of the data entered into the CRF, (ii) entries against source documents alongside adherence to the protocol, (iii) trial specific procedures and (iv) Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This monitoring will be carried out as per the trial specific Monitoring Plan. Changes to data will be recorded and fully auditable. Data errors will be documented and corrective actions implemented. Data validation will be implemented and discrepancy reports will be generated following data entry to identify data that may be out of range or inconsistent, or protocol deviations, based on data validation checks programmed into the clinical trial database. For routinely collected clinical data the NHS record will be the source document and for study specific measurements the CRF will be the source document.\n\nData management:\n\nThe PI (or designee) will collect all data and record this in the CRF. Each participant will be allocated a unique participant study number at trial entry, and this, and initials, will be used to identify him or her on the CRF for the duration of the trial. Data will be collected from the time of trial entry until hospital discharge. Trial data will be entered onto a CRF and processed electronically as per NICTU SOPs and the study specific Data Management Plan (DMP). Submitted data will be reviewed for completeness and entered onto a secure, backed-up custom database. Due care will be taken to ensure data safety and integrity, and compliance with GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Data queries will be raised electronically. The designated site staff will be required to respond to these queries within 2 weeks and send them back to the CTU after the queries have been reviewed and signed by the CI/delegated staff member. Any amended information will then be entered in the study database. A copy of the signed data query form should be retained with the CRF at the investigator site.\n\nIf the participant is transferred to another hospital the PI or designated member of the site study team will liaise with the receiving hospital to ensure complete data capture as per CRF instruction. If this is not possible, the primary outcome must be collected as a minimum. CRFs are to be submitted to the CTU as per the CRF submission schedule. Data censorship for each trial will occur 90 days post randomisation.\n\nAnalysis Population The primary analysis will be conducted on all outcome data obtained from all participants regardless of protocol adherence, i.e. intention to treat analysis.\n\nIt is possible that some enrolled subjects may not be treated with study drug. Therefore a secondary analysis of the all-treated population analysis will be undertaken.\n\nFor the Phase 1 trial no formal statistical analysis will be performed on safety data. The primary analysis will be descriptive and will focus on adverse events. The number of pre specified cell infusion associated events will also be reported. Descriptive analysis of pulmonary and non-pulmonary organ function will also be undertaken. We plan to publish the data from the phase 1 study.\n\nIn the completed Phase 1 REALIST trial, infusion of 400 million cells was achieved without any dose limiting toxicity at day 7 and has been approved by the DMEC as the intervention dose for this study.\n\nFor the Phase 2 trial, adverse events will be reported as for the Phase 1 study. For continuously distributed outcomes, differences between groups will be tested using independent samples t-tests and analysis of covariance with transformations of variables to normality if appropriate, or non-parametric equivalents. Chi-square tests (or Fisher's Exact tests) will be used for categorical variables. A p value of 0.05 will be considered as significant.\n\nCorrelations between changes in the biological markers measured and physiological and clinical outcomes will be assessed by appropriate graphical and statistical methods including Pearson's (or Spearman's) correlation coefficient.\n\nA final analysis and report of the Phase 1 study is planned following the last patient's 90 day follow up. A final analysis and report of the phase 2 study is planned following the last patient's 90 day follow up. The 2 year follow up data will be published thereafter and will be an important long term outcome. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and approved by the independent DMEC prior to any analysis.\n\nAll the power calculations and methodology for data analysis have been confirmed by the trial statistician from the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU).\n\nMissing data:\n\nEvery effort will be made to minimise missing baseline and outcome data in this trial. The level and pattern of the missing data in the baseline variables and outcomes will be established by forming appropriate tables and the likely causes of any missing data will be investigated. This information will be used to determine whether the level and type of missing data has the potential to introduce bias into the analysis results for the proposed statistical methods, or substantially reduce the precision of estimates related to treatment effects. If necessary, these issues will be dealt with using multiple imputation or Bayesian methods for missing data as appropriate.\n\nSample size:\n\nThe phase 1 trial will recruit up to 18 participants. The sample size for the phase 2 REALIST trial is 60 patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and 60 patients with ARDS not due to COVID-19 (30 in each of the ORBCEL-C and placebo groups). Due to the clinical differences in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and other causes of ARDS, patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and other causes of ARDS will be recruited as separate cohorts. This will also facilitate timely reporting of the results from each cohort.\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the phase 2 trial is safety, there is, however, power to detect a difference in physiological outcomes.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure will be the difference in oxygenation index (OI) between the ORBCEL-C and placebo treated groups at day 7. Based on our data from a recently completed clinical trial in ARDS, the mean (standard deviation; SD) OI at day 7 in patients with ARDS is 62(51)cmH2O/kPa [4]. To allow 1:1 recruitment (ORBCEL-C vs placebo) a sample size of 56 subjects will have 80% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 using a two-sample t-test to detect a clinically significant difference of 39 cmH2O/kPa in OI between groups. In a previous phase 2 study of similar size, we have found that an intervention can demonstrate a change in OI of a similar magnitude confirming a treatment effect of this size can be achieved [4].\n\nAlthough we anticipate few withdrawals or loss to follow-up we have allowed for this in the sample size calculation. In previous UK multicentre studies in the critically ill <3% withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up [4, 65]. Therefore, a conservative drop-out rate of 5% has been estimated and the study will require a total of 60 patients (30 patients in the ORBCEL-C and 30 in the placebo group)."

In addition, many children who recover from this disease suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin.

                              "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive cholestatic disease associated with the development of cirrhosis and liver failure that may justify liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only drug approved specifically for the treatment of PBC. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into biliary epithelial cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in PBC patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus UDCA. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus UDCA. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 4,8,12,24,36 and 48. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase(ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time(PT), albumin(ALB), prealbumin(PA), are detected at these time points. Mayo risk score, portal hypertension, Liver histology, MELD score and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Stroke is the second most important cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Currently, the standard treatment for ischemic stroke is an intravenous tissue plasminogen activator(tPA; alteplase) and/or endovascular thrombectomy. However, the therapeutic time window for these treatments is narrow. Besides, endovascular thrombectomy requires specialized stroke expertise and endovascular skills. Less than 5% of ischemic stroke patients are treated by these therapy and not all patients achieve good outcomes. There is still a lack of therapy for the reduction disability from stroke. In 2018, at least 40 clinical trials intent to treat ischemic stroke using cell therapy. In particular, MSCs have shown great potential in the reduction disability from acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Meridigen is developing UMC119-06, a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human umbilical cord for the treatment of AIS disease."

                              "This phase I, multisite, pilot study will test whether infusions of human cord tissue derived MSCs (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\n\nThe study population will consist of six patients 18 to <21 years old with a life expectancy \u2265 72 hours and COVID-19 related MIS-C that is refractory to treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly recognized, serious, hyper-inflammatory syndrome that is occurring in small numbers of children, many of whom are within a month or so of recovering from a COVID-19 infection. While the clinical presentation varies, affected patients are typically previously healthy individuals who are less than 21 years of age. The diagnostic criteria include fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and multisystem involvement requiring hospitalization. Up to 75% of patients present with an element of cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, with some also requiring intubation with mechanical ventilation. Reported supportive treatments have included intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and aspirin. In the limited cases reported, up to 50% of children with MIS-C have antibodies to COVID-19 in their blood and may or may not be PCR positive on a nasal swab or throat culture. The disease is incompletely understood but currently believed, at least in part, to be a hyper-immune response to a recent COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, MSCs have been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and decrease production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, up to 70% of infused cells are engulfed by lung macrophages, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules by these macrophages. These observations have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may work through both anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and regenerative mechanisms.\n\nOver the past several months, MSCs have been tested in small cohorts of adult patients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to determine if the cytokine storm hypothesized to cause this complication could be suppressed by MSCs. Early results are encouraging, and formal clinical trials are underway. Extending this work into the pediatric population, the hypothesis of this study is that infusion of hCT-MSC can reverse the pro-inflammatory state in children with MIS-C.\n\nThis is a 6 patient, multisite, pilot study to test whether infusions of hCT-MSC are safe in pediatric patients with MIS-C. Information will also be gathered about the duration and severity of the participant's multisystem inflammatory syndrome. hCT-MSCs will be manufactured at Duke University Medical Center in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and shipped frozen to the treatment site, where they will remain stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until the day of dosing.\n\nThe baseline evaluation will include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate), echocardiogram, ECG or telemetry strip, HLA typing, Panel Reactive Antibody (anti-HLA antibody), inflammatory markers, blood counts, blood chemistry, coagulation, and COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests.Patients will be dosed with 2x10^6 hCT-MSCs/kg. Doses will be given on days 1, 2, 3, and a fourth, optional dose may be given on day 7 at the discretion of the investigator and the treating physician. Prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Hydrocortisone, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes via a syringe pump. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluids will be managed by the care team. Afterwards, the participant will continue to be monitored in their care setting per institutional standards. Participants will be evaluated by study staff the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications.\n\nThe participant will be monitored by study staff to assess for any infusion related adverse reactions or complications until discharge. Additional follow-up will occur on days 14, 28, and 90. Follow up testing will include assessment for adverse events as well as the tests done at baseline (with the exception of HLA typing and COVID PCR."

Standard therapy consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which is efficacious in 80% of patients. However, current treatment strategies are complicated by frequent relapse after drug withdrawal, medication intolerance, and refractory disease. Alternative medical therapy may be need for AIH.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in AIH patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus conventional treatment (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus conventional treatment. (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96.

                              "This study seeks to find and enroll participants with new onset Type 1 diabetes (T1D) within 6 months of the first dose of insulin. T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year."

                              "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the leading causes of vision loss and irreversible blindness. It is stated that 1.4 million people are affected in the world and its prevalence is 1:4000. Stem cell applications are methods that are increasingly gaining importance in the field of regenerative medicine and ophthalmology. In addition to many experimental studies in retinal diseases including retinitis pigmentosa, there are also clinical studies reporting successful results on humans. The most widely used stem-cell group in current clinical practice is mesenchymal stem cells. The advantages are that they are relatively easy to obtain and do not induce severe immune responses. Clinical studies in stem cell therapies for the eye suggest that stem cells benefit the surrounding tissue by secreting support such as growth factors, and extracellular vesicles, mostly due to their trophic and paracrine effects. In intraocular applications, there has been a tendency to apply mesenchymal stem cells around/outside the eye, including subtenon and suprachoroidal application due to side effects such as retinal detachment and epiretinal membrane.\n\nOther cellular products that have been studied in animal studies and clinical research in recent years are exosomes. Exosomes are a subgroup of extracellular vesicles released from cells. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles 30-150 nm in size and carry at least one of the exosomal proteins CD63, CD9, CD81, syntenin-1 and TSG101. Exosomes are secreted from different cells in the organism and are also found in body fluids. Exosomes play a role in the transportation of biomolecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins from one cell to another and in this way, they function in genetic information transfer, and reprogramming of the opposite cell and intercellular communication. One of the sources of exosomes is mesenchymal stem cells that secrete high amount of exosomes. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been reported to have therapeutic effects, just like mesenchymal stem cells. It is thought that stem cells also exert their clinical effects through paracrine factors they secrete rather than being implanted in the tissue. However, the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stem cells has not been fully understood, and exosomes are thought to contribute to the effect. The storage and durability of exosomes may provide advantages in therapeutic applications compared to mesenchymal stem cells and may provide more immunological advantages in allogeneic applications compared to cellular treatments since they do not contain cells.\n\nOne of the sources from which mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained is Wharton jelly, which is the mesenchymal tissue of the umbilical cord. Stem cells originating from Wharton gel are a good source of stem cells due to their high differentiation capacity, high regeneration capacity, constant doubling time, high proliferation capacity, low immunogenicity, and no ethical problems due to non-invasive methods, and easy availability.\n\nThis clinical trial will enroll patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. The diagnosis of RP is made by clinical fundus examination, examinations in our clinic, and genetic analysis.\n\nAt the beginning of the study, all volunteers will undergo a full ophthalmologic examination including best-corrected visual acuity, anterior segment and fundus examination with a slit lamp, OCT (optical coherence tomography), VF (visual field), ERG (electroretinogram), mfERG (multifocal ERG), OCTA (optical coherence tomography). Retinal and choroidal thickness and ellipsoid bandwidth in OCT, MD (mean deviation) value showing sensitivity in VF, amplitude and latency times in ERG and mf-ERG, vascular density and vascular flow ratios in OCTA will be recorded.\n\nThe volunteers will be randomized into three. The 1st group will be the placebo group (45 volunteers) and 0.5 cc saline physiological saline will be applied to the subtenon space. 2nd group of patients (45 volunteers) will undergo a subtenon injection of Wharton gel-derived mesenchymal stem cell suspension. A suspension containing mesenchymal stem cell exosomes from Wharton jelly will be applied to the subtenon distance to the 3rd group of patients (45 volunteers). A single eye of each volunteer will be included. Informed consent will be obtained from the volunteers.\n\nAllogeneic human Wharton gel tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells and their exosomes will be obtained from healthy female volunteers, who is over 18 years old, under sterile conditions after HBV, HCV, HIV virus and \"Treponema Pallidum\" (VDRL) tests were performed. Cord tissue obtained from birth will be carried in a sterile transfer solution and will be processed to obtain stem cells in Erciyes University Genome and Stem Cell GMP (good manufacturing practices) certified laboratories. Exosomes will be obtained by the ultracentrifugation method in the same facility.\n\nFor injection into the subtenon distance, the conjunctiva and tenon will be opened with a small incision about 10 mm away from the lower temporal area, then 20 gauge curved subtenon cannula will be advanced parallel to the sclera and injected into the posterior subtenon area. All volunteers will be prescribed antibiotics and steroid drops after the surgical procedure.\n\nFull ophthalmological examination and examinations at the beginning of the study will be performed and recorded again on the 1st day, 1st month, 2nd month, 3rd month and 6th months of the anterior segment and fundus examination, OCT (optical coherence tomography), VF (visual field) ), ERG (electroretinogram), mfERG (multifocal ERG), OCTA (optical coherence tomography) examinations will be performed.\n\nIn addition, a questionnaire evaluating the visual functions subjectively will be administered at the 1st, 3rd and 6th-month visits. (National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire - 25 / National Eye Institute (USA) Visual Function Questionnaire ). Two masked investigators will perform analyses.\n\nPost-procedure 1st Day, 1st Month, 2nd Month, 3rd Month and 6th Month data will be compared among study groups and within groups."

In designing this bio-system, we make use of several observations. First, bone osteoblasts are important in promoting hematopoietic stem cell expansion, accordingly, this bio-system will ensure the physical proximity of the cord blood stem cells to a 3D bone tissue derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These MSCs will be isolated from Wharton's jelly, and by using an osteogenic medium and special scaffolds, these MSCs will differentiate into osteogenic progenitors creating a 3D bone structure. The other observation is that, co-culture of cord blood stem cells with mesenchymal stem cells is superior to liquid cultures in terms of ex vivo expansion , accordingly, in this experiment, undifferentiated MSCs will be co-cultured with cord blood stem cells in this created 3D bone structure. This is a unique design that has the potential to expand cord blood stem cells more efficiently."

MODS is one of the chief causes of post-operative death for acute type A aortic dissection(ATAAD) patients, and it was reported that MODS accounted for more than half of the death after surgery for ATAAD. Despite recent advance in surgical technique, mortality rate remains high in such critical care conditions.\n\nIn animal models, studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of MSCs with respect to ischemia-reperfusion injury of heart, lungs, kidney, brains and livers. Several pilot studies have provided evidence that MSC may be effective in treating critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, acute renal failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, in the present pilot study, the investigators hypothesized that timely initiation of mesenchymal stem cells(MSC) will positively influence survival and biochemical indexesof patients with MODS after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft for ATAAD. The trial contain two parts:\n\nPart one(prenvention scheme): to explore the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSC, we will recruit patients who are diagnosed with ATAAD, and 8 patients will be administrated intervenously with MSC immediately after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft while other 8 not. Then we will monitor their MODS related biochemical indexes, sequential organ failure assessment(SOFA) scores, comparing to those don't be treated with MSC.\n\nPhase two(treatment scheme): for patients presenting severe MODS(SOFA score\u226510) after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft, we will randomly use MSC to 8 of patients while other 8 not. Then we will monitor their MODS related biochemical indexes, SOFA scores, comparing to those don't be treated with MSC.\n\nThe dosage of the MSC was determined on the basis of the previous clinical studies, which is 1000000 cells per kilogram of body weight and administrated intervenously ."

                              "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of death for premature newborns with low birth weights. In addition, many children who recover from the disease suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive.\n\nIt has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes, and so on.\n\nPNEUMOSTEM\u00ae consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is intended to treat BPD in premature infants. This is a long term follow-up study of the earlier part of the phase I clinical trial."

                              "Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are common debilitating complications after surgical repaired for ATAAD. MODS is one of the chief causes of post-operative death for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients, and it was reported that MODS accounted for more than half of the death after surgery for ATAAD. Despite recent advance in surgical technique, mortality rate remains high in such critical care conditions. In animal models, studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of MSCs with respect to ischemia-reperfusion injury of heart, lungs, kidney, brains and livers. Several pilot studies have provided evidence that MSC may be effective in treating critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, acute renal failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is increasing evidence that MSCs function in a paracrine manner. Exosomes have been reported to activate signaling pathways by binding to receptors. Compared with mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes are more stable and storable and no risk of aneuploidy. The possibility of immune rejection after allogeneic administration of exosomes is lower and can provide alternative treatment for a variety of diseases.\n\nThe trial contains two parts:\n\nPart one (prevention scheme):to explore the safety and efficacy of exosome of MSC, the investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with ATAAD, and 15 participants will be administrated intravenously with exosome of MSC immediately after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple branched stent graft while other 15 not. Then the investigators will monitor participants' MODS related biochemical indexes, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, comparing to those don't be treated with exosome of MSC.\n\nPhase two (treatment scheme): for patients presenting severe MODS (SOFA score\u226510) after ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft, the investigators will randomly use exosome of MSC to 15 of participants while other 15 not. Then the investigators will monitor participants' MODS related biochemical indexes, SOFA scores, comparing to those don't be treated with MSC. The dosage of the exosome of MSC was determined on the basis of the previous clinical studies, which is 180mg once a time and administrated intravenously."

                              "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) are considered the standard of care for many malignancies, such as lymphoma, myeloma and some leukemias, and so on. Graft failure after auto-HSCT is a formidable complication. It occurs in 2-9.5% of patients and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections and hemorrhagic complications. There are various options for the management of graft failure. The most common treatment of graft failure is growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)and recombinant erythropoietin,but it usually effective in the short term and no effect on platelet counts.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and so on.As an important source of hematopoietic stem cell, cord blood has been widely used in clinical practice. It is reported that cord blood combined with MSCs can increase engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, to our knowledge, the report about efficacy of treatment of graft that develops after auto-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor combined with cord blood is absent.If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors or MSCs combined with cord blood in treating patients with graft failure after auto-HSCT."

It is designed to:\n\ni) Determine dose safety of ORBCEL-C (selected Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human umbilical cord) ii) Evaluate treatment activity through assessment of biomarkers\n\nThis trial has two main stages:\n\nStage 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered by observing for occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).\nStage 2 will use the maximum tolerated dose found in stage 1 to and further determine safety and activity outcomes of ORBCEL-C.\n\nUpon completion of this trial we hope to be able to justify and conduct separate, larger scale trials using ORBCEL-C.\n\nOBJECTIVES For Both PSC and AIH patients\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 1 is:\n\n\u2022 To determine the maximum tolerated single intravenous infusion dose of ORBCEL-C over a 14-day reporting period to take forward to Stage 2 of the clinical trial (study). All patients who have been recruited to and completed the 14-day reporting period in stage 1 will continue to be evaluated for outcomes as per Stage 2.\n\nThe primary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\n\u2022 Is safe and tolerated over the period of trial follow up (up to 56 days)\n\nFor PSC patients only \u2022 Reduces serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients with PSC. This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate of clinical outcomes in PSC\n\nFor AIH patients only\n\n\u2022 Reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in patients with AIH. This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate marker of hepatic inflammatory activity and outcomes in AIH.\n\nThe secondary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C elicits a change over the duration of the study after treatment in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\nLiver biochemistry and function, immunoglobulin G concentrations (in AIH patients) and composite risk scores\nNon-invasive clinical markers of fibrosis\nPatient quality of life (QoL)\nSeverity of co-existent IBD in patients with PSC.\n\nFurther exploratory research objectives of the trial determine whether MSC infusion modulates the immune response by measuring whether treatment elicits a change in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\nMarkers of immune activation including immunoglobulin values and C-reactive protein concentration\nMarkers of biliary injury including total bile acid levels\nCirculating inflammatory cells profile this includes phenotypic expression of T regulatory cells (Tregs) a common mechanistic primary endpoint\nEndothelial cell activation markers such as VAP-1 and ICAM1\nSerum cytokine, chemokine, microRNA and RNA expression profiles"

                              "As biologic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial data have demonstrated, inflammation is a key driver of coronary artery atherosclerosis, which is associated with pathologic injury and dysregulation of the endothelial cells lining the luminal wall of arteries, accumulation of lipids, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, \"foam cells\", and aggregated platelets at the arterial luminal wall, resulting in plaque formation. Circulating biomarkers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of cholesterol and other traditional risk factors. Recently, a gigantic proof-ofconcept trial CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) showed that an antibody that neutralizes IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2 can reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in secondary prevention, which provides intriguing support for the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover, another agent widely used to treat inflammatory conditions, colchicine,the LoDoCo study (Low-Dose Colchicine) trial has also showed a highly significant reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events over a 3-year follow-up, which also showed promise anti-inflammation in coronary artery disease. Therefore, these studies has demonstrated beyond doubt that inflammation plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis and, more importantly, that it can be effectively modulated.\n\nHowever, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. Colchicine causes gastrointestinal distress sufficient to warrant discontinuation of the medication in over 10% of individuals, the both of which severely limits the wide range of clinical applications. Moreover, more recent clinical evidence from the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) has come to challenge the above presented clinical data. low-dose MTX, when compared with placebo, failed to reduce the adverse CV events comprising the original primary end point regarding the cardioprotective effects of MTX. Evidence suggested that the inconsistent cardioprotective effects of different anti-inflammatory agents may be a reflection of the distinct pathways targeted. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and immune disease involving multiple cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and mast cells (MCs). Thus, therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit inflammation injury.\n\nThe latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. In low-density lipoproteinreceptor knockout mice atherothrombosis models, MSC-treated mice displayed a signifcant 33% reduction in circulating LY-6C hei monocytes, a 77% reduction of serum CCL2 levels, and signifcantly affected lesion development, which was reduced by 33% in the aortic root. These lesions contained 56% less macrophages and showed a 61% reduction in T cell numbers. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-\u03b2,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) .We found WJMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI in mouse AMI models. At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC possess a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in atherosclerosis. In particular safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and other studies.\n\nGiven the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs can drive beneficial in therapy of atherosclerosis. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly assigning 300 patients with coronary artery disease to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs or placebo , to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with coronary artery disease."

Plain radiograph remained the main modality in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Chondrogen is a mesenchymal stem cell-derived from umbilical cord tissue product. The mesenchymal stem cell is used for the study because of its ability to proliferate and differentiate into various tissues such as chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteocytes. Various clinical studies have been conducted for arthritis, orthopedic, joint, and cartilage.\n\nThis study will enroll 100 patients age 30-70 years old. They will be divided into 2 groups which are the group which will receive the investigational drug (ChondrogenTM and HA) and another group will receive a placebo (saline and HA). It will be a randomized double-blinded study where the participants and the investigator would not know what are the things being received. This study will be conducted for 24 months. The injection will be given on the baseline day after screening the volunteers. The patients will be assessed on VAS, WOMAC, IKDC, KOOS PROMIS29, the interleukins, and MRI."

Eligible patients with chronic spinal cord injury will receive intravenous, lumbar, and local administration of hUC-MSCs/hUCB-MSCs (provided by Cell Bank of Stem Cell Clinical Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University). The primary outcome measure of this study is neurologic function scores, including ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) motor score, ASIA sensory score, ASIA impairment scale (ASIA classification), and acupuncture score. These scores will be used to evaluate the recovery of nerve function after spinal cord injury and determine the therapeutic efficacy and persistence. The secondary outcome measures of this study include Walking Index of Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI), Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Kunming Locomotion Scale (KLS), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and Visual Analogous Scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse reactions. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, patients will be followed up to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation in the treatment of spinal cord injury."

Approximately 26 patients (male and female) ages \u2265 2 and\u2264 45 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome caused by molecular findings consistent with a pathogenic mutation in the gene TCF4. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient's parent or legal guardian/ authorized representative (LAR) prior to participation in the study. The study includes screening, baseline, treatment and safety follow up periods. The procedure for intravenous administration is performed under the supervision of clinician with experience caring for patients with PTHS.\n\nEach patient will remain inpatient for at least 24 hours after the initial dose of AlloRx, for frequent vital sign monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine safety tests, and neurologic assessments. Investigators will work closely with the parent/legal guardian to ensure that any signs of discomfort/distress are immediately communicated to study staff. For the administration of the initial dose of study drug in each study cohort, patients will be dosed in a sequential fashion with no more than one patient receiving their first dose of study drug on the same day.\n\nAn independent data DSMB will review all safety and laboratory data throughout the study on a periodic basis and ad hoc should an SAE occur. The DSMB will also review all available safety data when all patients have received 2 doses of AlloRx and have had at least two weeks of follow-up in order to determine if it is safe to dose the next patient."

The cord tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 200 units/ml penicillin and 200 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with 4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15 ml PBS. The cord will be gently scraped with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced pieces will be incubated in 17.5 ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50 ml conical tube for ~3.5 hours in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37\u2070C. After ~3.5 hours, the digested lysate will pass through a strainer and will be diluted three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two 25 cm2 flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37\u2070C. The flasks will be fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic solution) every third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will be transferred in two 75 cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UCMSCs at P3 will be characterized using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be used for transplantation in patients. Fifteen (15) subjects will be treated with three intravenous infusions (IV) of 500,000 UCMSCs per Kg body weight delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion."

                              "Umbilical cord blood is a source of blood-forming cells that can be used for transplantation. The major problem with this type of transplant is the small number of blood-forming cells available in each cord unit, which may delay the \"take\" of the graft in the recipient. A strategy to overcome this problem is to give 2 cord blood units, increasing the number of cord blood cells in one of them in the laboratory before they are transplanted. This is done in order to increase their number. The expansion of 1, but not both, of the cord blood units will allow the research team to decide more effectively whether the laboratory expansion is responsible for the speed and content of the \"take.\" At this time, no proof exists that this expansion technique will improve the performance of the cord blood specimens.\n\nIn order to collect a larger expansion of the numbers of cord blood cells, recent research suggests that growing the cord blood cells on a layer of bone marrow stromal cells increases the number of expanded cells which can be collected. In the body, these stromal cells form a matrix or \"spider web\" in the bone marrow. Blood-forming bone marrow cells (looking like dewdrops) grow on this stromal cell matrix (spider web) and are nurtured by the stromal cells. In this research study, researchers will either collect marrow stromal cells from a family member through a bone marrow aspiration, or they will use \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells that have been collected from a healthy donor. These \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells were grown and frozen by Mesoblast Systems. These stromal cells from either your family member or \"off-the-shelf\" will hopefully improve the performance of the cord blood cells after they are given to you.\n\nPlacement of central venous catheter for collection of \"back-up\" peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC):\n\nBefore you have back-up PBPC collected or you receive chemotherapy, you will require placement of a hollow plastic tube (catheter) into a large vein inside your body. This catheter will be used to draw blood and to give medications and fluids. The catheter is inserted through the skin in the upper chest and extends to a point above the right side of your heart. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.\n\nCollection of back-up stem cells:\n\nBecause collecting additional cells from the donor of the cord blood is not possible if the transplant with cord blood fails, a back-up PBPC or bone marrow sample to ensure recovery of your marrow function will be collected from you and frozen before the high dose chemotherapy begins. This specimen will only be used if doctors think it is necessary.\n\nPeripheral blood progenitor cell collection (Leukapheresis):\n\nBefore collection of the PBPC, you will be treated with a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which will cause the important stem cells in the marrow to move the peripheral blood where they will be collected. This medication is given as a shot under the skin once a day for 3-7 days, at which time your PBPC will be collected from your central catheter during a 3-4 hour outpatient procedure. This procedure is standard, and is called leukapheresis. You will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.\n\nBone Marrow Collection:\n\nIf the leukapheresis cannot be performed successfully, you will receive general anesthesia in the operating room and will have multiple needle sticks of the hip bones in order to collect bone marrow. Less than 5 percent of your bone marrow will be taken. This procedure, if done, will also require you to sign a separate consent form.\n\nSelection of alternate back-up donor:\n\nIf your own back-up bone marrow or back-up PBPC cannot be collected, a family member will be asked to serve as a back-up donor or an identified third cord blood unit may be used should both the cord blood units fail to function. A back-up donor or product will be required for you to participate in this research\n\nSelection of a stromal cell donor for cord cultures:\n\nIn this study, researchers will identify a donor for the stromal cells. This will either be a family member or from an unrelated healthy donor whose marrow stromal cells were collected, grown, and frozen by Mesoblast Systems (off-the-shelf). If your family member is used, they will collect about 7 tablespoons of bone marrow from them.This family member's tissue type (HLA antigens) does not exactly match yours. That bone marrow will be taken to the laboratory where over 3-4 weeks, marrow stromal cells will be grown. These marrow stromal cells produce vitamin-like growth factors that may help your cord blood cells expand to greater numbers. If a family member is not appropriately HLA matched, does not meet eligibility, is not a candidate due to health reasons, or if the participant's disease is getting worse so that there is not enough time to grow the family member's marrow cells into marrow stromal cells, then \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells that have been collected from a healthy donor will be used for the procedure. These \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells were grown and frozen by Mesoblast Systems. These cells have been safely given to patients with peripheral vascular disease, but their use in this study is considered investigational.\n\nYour bone marrow transplant doctors will assign you to one of 3 chemotherapy treatments, which are discussed below.\n\nHigh-dose chemotherapy treatment (Myeloablative):\n\nIf you are between 1 and 55 years of age and can receive high-dose chemotherapy, or you are between 55 and 65 years old and your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine, clofarabine, busulfan, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and total body irradiation.\n\nYou will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over 60 minutes as an outpatient usually during the week before admission. If the test dose cannot be given as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -9 for IV fluids and the busulfan test dose. This low-level \"test\" dose of busulfan is to check how the level of busulfan in your blood levels changes over time. This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the target blood level that matches your body size.\n\nAbout 11 samples of blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of busulfan. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These blood samples will be drawn at various timepoints starting before the Busulfan infusion and continuing over approximately the next 11 hours. The blood samples will be repeated again with the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment. Each sample will be about 1 teaspoon of blood. A temporary heparin lock will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.\n\nIf you received the test dose as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8 and will receive fluids by vein. On Days -7 through -4, you will receive by vein fludarabine over 1 hour, clofarabine by vein over 1 hour, and busulfan by vein over 3 hours. You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. On Day -3, you will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation. You will \"rest\" (not receive chemotherapy drugs) on Days -2 and -1. Day 0 is the day of transplantation, so the negative day numbers are used to label the treatment days before transplant.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nLower-dose chemotherapy treatment (Non-myeloablative):\n\nIf you are older than 55 and 80 years of age or less, or are of any age with a pre-existing medical condition that prevents you from receiving high dose chemotherapy, you will receive fludarabine- cyclophosphamide-ATG-total body irradiation. You will receive cyclophosphamide as a single dose on Day -6. Fludarabine will be given once a day for 4 days in a row (Days -6 through -3). You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. You will also receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation on Day -1. Day 0 is the day of transplantation. Rituximab may be given on Day -9 if appropriate for your disease.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nReduced Intensity chemotherapy treatment:\n\nIf you are between the ages of 1 and 80 years old (and the study doctors think this would keep you from receiving the full myeloablative therapy), if you cannot receive low-dose total body irradiation, and if your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine-melphalan-ATG. Starting on Day -5 you will receive fludarabine given once a day for 4 days in a row (Days -5 through -2). You will receive Melphalan as a single dose on Day -2. You will receive ATG on Days -3 and -2. Day 0 is the day of transplantation.\n\nAll chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other medications that must be given by vein will be infused through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule. Chemotherapy may be stopped if intolerable side effects occur.\n\nExpansion of cord blood:\n\nOn Day -14, one of your two cord blood units will be thawed in the MD Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory and expanded over a layer of marrow stromal cells from your family member or from \"off-the-shelf\" marrow stromal cells. The expansion will continue for about 2 weeks and when complete, the cells will be given to you on Day 0 as described below. A small amount of cord blood cells (less than 3%) will be used for laboratory procedures that measure the quality of the product.\n\nThe CliniMACS System is a medical device that is used to separate types of blood cells from blood that is removed from the body during leukapheresis. These separated cells are processed for use in treatments such as stem cell transplants.\n\nTransplantation of cord blood:\n\nTwo (2) days after completion of high or lower-dose therapy (Day 0), both units of cord blood (the expanded and the unexpanded cord) will be infused into you (one at a time) through your catheter. The unexpanded cord will be thawed and infused first, followed by the infusion of the cells that were expanded in the lab. Each unit will take about 30 minutes to infuse. You will then be hospitalized until your marrow function is restored enough. This usually takes between 3-6 weeks. During this time, you will receive a variety of medications, transfusions, and other standard procedures aimed at decreasing the risks of this procedure, such as graft vs. host disease (GVHD).\n\nGraft versus host disease (GVHD) preventive therapy:\n\nGVHD results from a reaction of the transplanted cord blood cells against certain tissues in your body. In an attempt to prevent or decrease the severity of GVHD, you will receive 2 drugs. Mycophenolate will be given through your catheter 2 times per day (morning and evening) on Days -3 through Day 100. Tacrolimus will be given as a 24-hour continuous infusion over 3-6 weeks. Around Day 30 or 40 (after engraftment), the tacrolimus will be changed to pills given once a day for 180 days (6 months). If GVHD is present, tacrolimus may then be continued longer. The number of tacrolimus pills may vary according to the blood levels of the drug, but usually are between 1-5 pills. Your dose of tacrolimus can be gradually lowered around Day 180 if no GVHD is present. This medicine is used for 6-9 months (longer if chronic GVHD occurs).\n\nYou will remain on study as long as your disease does not return. If your disease returns, you will be taken off study and you may be offered participation in another study or other standard treatments.\n\nFollow-up after transplant:\n\nAfter you leave the hospital, you will be seen regularly in the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation at MD Anderson. The frequency of the visits may vary, but may be as often as daily. Routine blood (1-2 tablespoons) and urine tests will be performed. The frequency of blood tests may also vary, but may be performed daily. You will have bone marrow samples collected before transplant and then as needed during the first 100 days after transplant, every 3 months during the first year after transplant, and then once a year while you are on study. After that, bone marrow samples will be collected once a year, indefinitely. These samples are being collected to look for tumor (as a staging test) and to looFk for chimerism (the percent of tumor cells detectable that can predict graft failure and/or relapse). To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.\n\nParticipants with lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease will need a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed before transplant, then as needed during the first 100 days after transplant, and then every 3 months for the first year after transplant. After that, these scans will be done yearly. You will be on study for 1 year but then will be followed yearly as is standard of care.\n\nThis is an investigational study. All treatment drugs given to you are FDA approved and commercially available. The CliniMACS device is not FDA approved. At this time, it is being used in research only. Up to 125 patients may take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
