Higher scores indicate better motor function. The primary endpoint in this study was computed from the GMFM-66 score in three steps: 1) The \"observed\" change in motor function from Baseline to Month 12 was calculated (positive values indicate improvement, negative values indicate reduction, and zero indicates no change) for each participant; and 2) The expected change in motor function was determined for each participant based on published growth curves; and 3) The expected change in GMFM-66 was subtracted from the observed change to yield the final primary outcome. Positive values indicate a greater change than would be expected, zero indicates change as expected, and negative values indicate a smaller amount of change than would be expected."

Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0-5 according to the adjacent table, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0-2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. Each side of the body is graded independently. The ISNCSCI exam is used for determining the neurological level of injury.

Each performance item is rated on this scale with a given number of points from 0 to 10 or 0 to 15. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 100. A higher number is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence.

In designing this bio-system, we make use of several observations. Firstly, bone osteoblasts are important in promoting hematopoietic stem cell expansion , accordingly, this bio-system will ensure the physical proximity of the cord blood stem cells to a 3D bone tissue derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These MSCs will be isolated from Wharton's jelly, and by using an osteogenic medium and special scaffolds, these MSCs will differentiate into osteogenic progenitors creating a 3D bone structure . The other observation is that, co-culture of cord blood stem cells with mesenchymal stem cells is superior to liquid cultures in terms of ex vivo expansion , accordingly, in this experiment, undifferentiated MSCs will be co-cultured with cord blood stem cells in the created 3D bone structure."
