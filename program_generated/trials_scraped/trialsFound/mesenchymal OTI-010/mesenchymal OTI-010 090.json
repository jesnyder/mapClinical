                              "OBJECTIVES:\n\nCompare the safety and efficacy of OTI-010 vs placebo as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HLA-identical sibling matched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (18 to 34 vs 35 to 55) and donor/recipient gender (female donor/male recipient vs female donor/female recipient vs male donor/female recipient vs male donor/male recipient).\n\nConditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV once daily on days -5 and -4 and undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -3 to -1 OR busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV once daily on days -3 and -2.\nGraft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. Patients also receive cyclosporine orally or IV (over 1-4 hours) twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing for at least 6 months followed by a taper until 1 year after transplantation.\n\nOTI-010 therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.\n\nArm I: Patients receive placebo IV 4 hours before peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0.\nArm II: Patients receive OTI-010 IV 4 hours before PBSCT on day 0.\nArm III: Patients receive a higher dose of OTI-010 IV 4 hours before PBSCT on day 0.\nAllogeneic stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.\n\nPatients are followed at 18 weeks, at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients (33 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 months."
