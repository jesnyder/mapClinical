Due to a lack of anticoagulant in the tube, PRF becomes a gel after 15-20 minutes of being isolated. These properties make PRF useful in reconstructive and aesthetic medicine but may also be beneficial for scar therapy in the same way PRP is currently used.",
                              "Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) has been used in surgical settings to stimulate healing and promote tissue regeneration. In the field of cosmetic medicine, PRP has been used topically or as an injection to stimulate collagen production and enhance the efficacy of cosmetic procedures such as fat transfer, hair loss therapies, laser treatments, and microneedling. Harvested PRP has platelets, fibrin, and white blood cells, which contribute to wound healing, neocollagenesis, and elastogenesis"
