                              "Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes will be developed and patented as an advanced technology platform as an autologous treatment protocol to repair damaged cartilage tissue. The fact that this treatment is obtained from an autologous source will significantly contribute to the literature in the field of personalized therapy (personalized medicine) and will pave the way for discoveries. Experiences from clinical trials may guide the use of MSC exosomes in other tissue and cell damaged pathologies and immune pathologies or chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nThis study was supported by a grant (1004, 20AG031) from The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)."

Gaining access to this valuable source of regenerative cells could improve the outcome of joint restorative procedures. To avoid costly two-stage procedures and ex vivo manipulation, exploiting these autologous cells in a minimally invasive way with minimal manipulation could provide a novel cost-effective approach.\n\nThis study will evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a novel medical device (a synovial brush) and procedure (synovial brushing) to increase the number of autologous minimally manipulated MSCs in the knee. Twenty patients undergoing microfracture for isolated chondral defects will be randomly assigned to either a control group (microfracture only, 10 patients) or the intervention group (microfracture plus synovial brushing, 10 patients). The device is intended to increase the number of MSCs within the joint as a final stage during surgery, aiding repair by bolstering those MSCs recruited from the bone marrow."
