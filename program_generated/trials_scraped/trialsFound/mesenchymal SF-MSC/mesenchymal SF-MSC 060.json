                              "This is a proof-of-concept study to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel device to increase the reparative capacity of the knee. The discovery of a resident population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within synovial fluid (SF) was the first description of this reparative cell population having direct access to superficial cartilage and joint structures. The ready access of SF MSC to cartilage and other joint tissues offers a novel strategy for joint repair. Current arthroscopic procedures result in the removal of all SF MSCs due to continuous irrigation throughout the procedure. The current study would benefit the patient by greatly increasing the reparative capacity of the joint by bolstering MSC numbers and retaining those MSCs within the joint after surgery. By accessing MSCs from the synovium it is anticipated that these cells would be entrapped/migrate into the marrow clot formed by microfracture of the sub-chondral bone. These MSCs would supplement those from the marrow and may result in faster, better quality repair."
