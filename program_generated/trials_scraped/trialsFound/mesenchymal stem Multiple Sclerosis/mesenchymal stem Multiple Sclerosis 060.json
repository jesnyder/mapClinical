                              "Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination. The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs. Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin.Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow derived MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur center will perform a clinical trial with intra venous transplantation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell.our purpose is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of cell transplantation after 1year following up."

Neuronal stem cells were shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.\n\nIn this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and restoration of neuronal function.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.\n\nSignificance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in general."

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as disease-modifying agents (DMDs).\n\nUnfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the deleterious immune reactions. According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS, an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune process, to protect axons and neurons from degeneration, and to enhance repair and facilitate remyelination.\n\nA specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown remarkable ability to modulate the immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs in people with MS."

                              "Immunomodulatory therapies to treat the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS) are designed to ameliorate the inflammatory processes that mediate the damage to the central nervous system (CNS) and to delay progression of the disease. To date, there is no effective means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single injection of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the effects of BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological, immunological and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow aspirates, purified by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single dose of autologous BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and immunological assessments will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at 1, 3, and 6 months after transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after transplant. Proposed trial will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a feasible and safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an environment of immune tolerance and through the local production of neurotrophic/growth factors, might induce neuroprotection and improvement in CNS function."

The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the injections.\n\nThe primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as secondary endpoints."
