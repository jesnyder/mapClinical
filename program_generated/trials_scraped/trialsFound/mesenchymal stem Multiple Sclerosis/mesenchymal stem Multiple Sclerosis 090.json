                              "This study, is designed as a phase 1/2 open-safety clinical trial. At its first phase, 15 consenting patients with MS are included.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nConsenting patients fulfilled the following 4 inclusion criteria for this study:\n\nthe clinical criteria of Poser et alfor definite MS;\nmen and nonpregnant women aged 25 to 65 years;\nduration of disease longer than 5 years; and\nfailure to respond to the currently available and registered agents for MS (ie, interferons, glatiramer acetate [Copaxone], and immuno-suppressors), as manifested by an increase of at least 1 degree in the EDSS score during the past year or the appearance of at least 2 major MS relapses during the same period.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\npatients who were treated with cytotoxic medications (ie, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and azathioprine) during the 3 months before the trial;\npatients with significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure or any other disease that may interfere with the ability to interpret the results of the study;\npatients with an active infection; and\npatients who showed severe cognitive decline or were unable to understand and sign the informed consent.\n\nBone marrow aspiration is performed under short general anesthesia with puncture from the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or a right lateral position. Approximately 200 mL of bone marrow inocula are obtained from each patient.\n\nMSC Preparation and Culture A culture of purified MSCs is prepared under aseptic conditions (positively pressurized clean rooms) using filtered sterilized Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with low glucose lev- els (Qiagen, Valencia, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- nystatin solution (all from Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit- Haemek, Israel).\n\nMesenchymal cells are cultured for 40 to 60 days, until they reach confluency, and then harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide-containing medium in liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C). At 2 weeks, a sample is taken for sterility testing and quality control. After sterility confirmed, the MSCs are transferred to the laboratory on dry ice, thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and washed twice with normal saline solution to remove any residual dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells are then resuspended in normal saline at a concentration of 10x106/mL to 15x106/mL. Two-thirds of the total number of cells (usually 60x106 to 100x106) are injected intrathecally, and one-third, intravenously. A sample of the cells to be injected is tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis; cells (98%) should express the surface markers characteristic of MSCs (CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and be negative for CD34, CD45, and CD14.\n\nTreatment Protocol All patients receive an intrathecal injection via a standard lumbar puncture (mean of 1 million cells per Kg of body weight) and an intravenous injection of 0.3-1 million cells per kg, intravenously..\n\nAn extension phase is scheduled for patients completing the first phase of this trial as an open prospective study with repeated intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous MSC in patients from the initial trial and 10 additional ones (total up to 24 patients) with progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive or relapsing-progressive). Patients should be defined as failures to first and second lines of immunomodulatory treatments experiencing deterioration (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS scale) during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major relapse without sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of body weight, intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or IV-injections of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the trial is 4 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).\n\nImmunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month 6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS) analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune activation or of regulatory cell phenotype."

An international panel of MS neurology and stem cell experts, as well as immunologists formed an \"International Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation\" (MSCT) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism that underlie the benefit. 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells.

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Onset typically occurs in early adulthood. Patients present with intermittent symptoms that are partially reversible; this form is termed relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Over time, most patients develop secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) which manifests as irreversible and gradual neurological impairments that often progress without acute relapses. Beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate represents the first line therapeutic option for RRMS. Clinical trials confirm that show partial efficacy, though they do not prevent the onset of secondary progression. SPMS, is the consequence of axonal loss and neurodegeneration and no current therapy has been effective. Stem cell therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. Clinical indications for adult stem cells, which can be safely harvested and normally behave well without formation of tumours, are rapidly increasing. The majority of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both, which can be easily obtained in clinically sufficient numbers from peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or umbilical cord blood and placenta. MSC can readily be isolated from a small sample of bone marrow and rapidly expanded so as to generate large numbers of cells for autologous therapies. When administered intravenously have an immune suppressive effect that can ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. When intravenously injected, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of brain-resident cells. Several disease models demonstrate axonal neuroprotection following MSC therapy, with some evidence that this is potentially mediated through the production of neurotrophic/growth factors, and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSC. For that reasons, MSC have become the focus of research as a potential cell therapy for inducing neuroprotection in human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.\n\nA growing body of literature confirms the therapeutic MSC biological properties, and provide a plausible mechanism of action to guide clinical trial design with a number of phase I/II trials in MS patients now underway. Experimental clinical trials in MS are being considered or have recently been initiated by several research groups, which are testing the therapeutic potential of different sources of MSC. Learning from previous clinical studies, and taking advantage of the potential that adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair and remyelination, to plan a clinical trial in patients with inflammatory MS seems reasonable. We propose a safety trial of a single intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSC into 8 subjects with RRMS. The trial proposed here will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC therapy during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS can establish a immunomodulatory and regenerative microenvironment and reverse neurological disability in RRMS patients."

Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of scanner used at baseline. Scans will be analyzed centrally. The 'baseline MRI scan' will be the reference for brain volume changes.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nDescriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed. Proportion of adverse events at each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution. The frequency, severity, timing and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize the safety of the intervention.\n\nThe probability of overall event-free survival (as well as progression-free, relapse-free, or MRI event-free survival) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated. The end point of progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater than 0.5 from baseline. Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with Wald-type 90% CIs based on Greenwood's formula for SE.\n\nDescriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using descriptive statistics. Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this efficacy measurement scales (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion.\n\nThe percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of those who have not met the end point by month 12.\n\nOther primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value minus the baseline value. The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from baseline measurement in the values at the month 1, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits was significantly different from zero,with baseline measurement defined as the screening assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other end points.\n\nTo calculate MSFC, results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint. The z scores that compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database."

Immunomodulatory therapies are useful in reducing the frequency of inflammatory processes (relapses) but don't delay significantly the progression of the disease, prevent long term disability or induce the repair of damaged tissue. This proposal contemplates the use of adult autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat patients with active MS. This is a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial in which 8 patients with active forms of MS and moderate disability will enter the trial with the primary objective of assessing the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of BM-MSC. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by gadolinium enhancing lesions though magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological effects and immunological effects. Once randomized, patients will undergo BM extraction and once confirmed the availability of the needed dose, they will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms (BM-MSC named XCEL-MC-ALPHA, or placebo). XCEL-MC-ALPHA will be cryopreserved for all patients regardless the allocated arm. At month 6, the treatment will be crossed. Patients will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years."

                              "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune de-myelinating disease in which the myelin sheaths of nerve cells in the central nervous system are damaged.This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and psychiatric issues. To date, There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks.\n\nStem cells possess strong immunomodulatory properties that are shown to play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesion. Clinical studies have shown that stem cells can be safely harvested and do not form tumors. Most of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both. When administered intravenously they have an immune inhibitory effect that can ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). When administered intravenously, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of nervous cells. Hence, MSC have become the focus of studies as a potential cell therapy for stimulating neuro-protection in human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.\n\nWe propose a safety and efficacy trial of a intravenous and intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells into patients with MS."

The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the injections. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as secondary endpoints.\n\nApplications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a \"run-in\" period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.\n\nOne month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post last MSC-injection.\n\nTo establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-\"run in period\" and for the whole duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared to the progression rate during the \"run-in\" period.\n\nThe follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters: WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.\n\nAll selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen. One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using our previously described protocol with slight modification.\n\nOne month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula."
