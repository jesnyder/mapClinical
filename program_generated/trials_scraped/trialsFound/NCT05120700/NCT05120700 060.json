                              "A phase I/II clinical trial (first in human) to assess the effectiveness and safety of the treatment of cartilage injury with a tissue engineering construct composed of stromal vascular fraction collected from the synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat of the injured knee, submitted to enzymatic processing in a single surgical time, associated with a collagen scaffold.\n\nThe primary outcomes will be assessed by 3T magnetic resonance imaging, quality of life and knee function questionnaires, in addition to perioperative and post-operative complications. Secondary outcomes will be evaluated by measuring the health resources used to ensure compatibility, reproducibility and generalizability of the technique.\n\nThe authors believe that adverse events will be similar to current surgical procedures and that there will be an improvement in knee function scores and quality of life of patients undergoing the procedure."
