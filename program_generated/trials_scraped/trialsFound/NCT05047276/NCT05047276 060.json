                              "This is a non-randomized, single arm, single center, phase I/II study of AloCelyvir in subjects with mUM to the liver, the main site for M1 in this disease. This study is divided into 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter in the Screening phase to assess eligibility criteria and perform a mandatory tumor biopsy. Upon meeting criteria, eligible subjects will be entered into the Treatment phase. Patients will receive AloCelyvir in weekly intravenous infusions at doses of 0.5x106 cells/kg for 8 weeks. After 4 first treatment doses a new tumor biopsy will be mandatory. Treatment will be maintained for 2 months (8 weeks) but can be stopped earlier if disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Subjects that are no longer receiving AloCelyvir will enter the Follow-up phase. Subjects that are no longer receiving AloCelyvir because of unacceptable toxicity or due to investigator judgment will undergo radiological evaluations of the tumor every 8 weeks during the first 12 months (48 weeks), and then every 12 weeks until the progression of disease (progression follow-up). Subjects that are no longer receiving Alocelyvir because of progression will enter the long term OS follow-up until their death or until the end of the study, whatever happens before. Subjects who have switched to an alternative treatment without disease progression will receive a formal follow-up with images tests until progression, and after progression long term follow up to record the date of death."
