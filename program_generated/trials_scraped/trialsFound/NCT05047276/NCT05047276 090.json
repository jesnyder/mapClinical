                              "0. Background:\n\nUveal melanoma (UM) is an orphan neoplasm but it is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults. Global overall survival (OS) at 5 years is lower than 50%. This elevated mortality rate is caused by a high incidence of metastases, and lack of active therapy. The metastatic behavior differs from cutaneous melanoma (CM) given the purely hematogenous dissemination and the tendency to metastasize to the liver 3. When liver metastases develop, life expectancy is reduced to 8-9 months. Chemotherapy treatment is unsuccessful in metastatic UM (mUM) and results in less than 5% overall response rate (ORR). There is no proof that chemotherapy prolongs survival and the 5-year survival rate of patients with UM has not improved in 25 years . New targeted therapies have not improved results.\n\nThe PULSE-UM study plans to treat mUM patients with an advanced therapy that seeks to activate the immune system and to study the mUM immune-environment in different ways to identify new immunotherapy targets.\n\nOverview of study design.\n\nThis is a single arm, single center, phase I/II study of AloCelyvir in subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma with liver disease. This study is divided into 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter the Screening phase to assess eligibility criteria and perform a mandatory tumor biopsy. Upon meeting criteria, eligible subjects will be entered into the Treatment phase. Patients will receive a weekly infusion of AloCelyvir. New tumor biopsy will be mandatory and performed around day +28 +/- 3 days (week 4). Treatment will be administered for 8 consecutive weeks but can be stopped because disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Subjects that have finished the 8-weeks period or has stopped the treatment because of unacceptable toxicity or due to investigator judgment will enter the follow-up phase (firstly for PFS until progression and lately long term follow-up until death).\n\nSubjects that have finished the 8-weeks period or has stopped the treatment because of unacceptable toxicity or due to investigator judgment will undergo radiological evaluations of the tumor every 8 weeks during the first 12 months (48 weeks), and then every 12 weeks until the progression of disease (progression follow-up). Also, patients that have received at least 1 dose of AloCelyvir will also initiate the safety evaluations. Safety evaluations will performed be every 8 weeks during the first 12 months (48 weeks).\n\nSubjects that are no longer receiving AloCelyvir because of progression will enter the long term OS follow-up until their death or until the end of the study (whatever happens before).\n\nSubjects who have switched to an alternative treatment without disease progression will receive a formal follow-up with images tests until progression, and after progression long term follow up to record the date of death.\n\nScreening phase.\n\nScreening will occur between Day -28 and Day 0 that is before first treatment administration. The purpose of the screening period is to establish protocol eligibility, as specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\nInformed consent of study procedures and tumor biopsy sample should be obtained prior to the 28-day screening window after the study has been fully explained to each subject, in order to permit tumor biopsy sample acquisition and analysis prior to enrollment.\n\nIf laboratory or imaging procedures were performed for alternate reasons prior to signing consent, these can be used for screening purposes with consent of the patient. However, all screening laboratory and imaging results must have been obtained within 28 days of enrollment.\n\nA mandatory fresh tumor tissue from liver biopsies before starting therapy, to compare stromal cell populations after combination treatment with AloCelyvir should be collected during screening visit (after informed consent is signed by the patient) and managed according to what is detailed in the laboratory manual. The collection of baseline tumor biopsies and around day +28 (week 4) is mandated unless the procedure confers a risk to the patient. The collection of tumor biopsies at the time of progression is optional but strongly encouraged.\n\nResults of screening assessments must be obtained prior to the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1/Day 1). Assessments may be performed on Day -1 or on Cycle 1/Day 1 prior to dosing. Clinical laboratory tests including pregnancy test (where applicable) can be performed within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects who complete the baseline visit and continue meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will begin the treatment phase of this study.\n\nTreatment phase.\n\nThe treatment phase will begin at the time of enrolment of the first patient and will consist in 2 cycles of 4 weeks (28 days). The treatment phase will end when the last patient finishes treatment plant.\n\nOnce registered and having received the confirmation of enrolment form from eCRF, subjects will receive a weekly IV infusion of AloCelyvir 0.5x106 cells/kg.\n\nTreatment will continue for 8 weeks or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Any grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity according to CTCAE criteria will be discussed in a safety committee formed by Principal Investigator, the head of UICEC Pharmacovigilance Team and the Clinical Trial Unit at IDIBELL. This committee will deem the toxicity as unacceptable or not.\n\nEvery effort should be made to minimize the time between enrollment and starting treatment. (i.e. within 2 day of enrollment).\n\nAn additional mandatory fresh tumor tissue from liver biopsies on day +28 +/- 3 days should be collected to compare stromal cell populations after combination treatment AloCelyvir. Management of sample is detailed in the laboratory manual.\n\nResults for LFTs, full blood count, and creatinine must be available before commencing an infusion of AloCelyvir, and reviewed by the treating physician or Investigator prior to dosing/dispensing.\n\nSubjects will be visited by Investigators every other week during the treatment phase, to closely follow up toxicity. Patients should be visited at least every month thereafter and every time that Principal Investigator deemed necessary.\n\nSubjects will undergo radiological evaluations of the tumor every 8 weeks during the first 48 weeks and then, every 12 weeks until disease progression. This schedule MUST be followed regardless of any delays in dosing or end of treatment due to other reason than disease progression.\n\nSafety assessments will be performed at each visit and include patient interview and reviewing of additional source documentation such as investigations, medical history and concomitant medications, as needed.\n\nEnd of treatment visit.\n\nThe visit scheduled 4 weeks after AloCelyvir last planned dose will be considered the end-oftreatment visit. This visit should be scheduled for 28 +/-3 days after the end of treatment for any reason.\n\nProgression (PFS) follow up.\n\nPatients that end treatment due to any reason other than disease progression, according to RECIST 1.1, will follow tumor evaluations every 8 weeks (up to week 48) and every 12 weeks or clinically indicated thereafter, until disease progression.\n\nLong term follow-up phase.\n\nAll patients (both, after disease progression or in the case that patients have switched to an alternative treatment without documented progression), should be followed until death or study closure. Date and reason of death should be documented consistently in patient record and in the eCRF.\n\nStudy oversight for safety evaluation.\n\nThis protocol will contain a safety part followed by an expansion part. The first 3 patients will be included in the safety part. Due to lack of standard treatment and dismal prognostic in this disease, no time restriction between patient enrollment will be applied.\n\nWhen all these 3 patients received at least 4 AloCelyvir administrations, the Principal Investigator together with the head of the Pharmacovigilance Team of the UICEC and the Clinical Trial Unit at IDIBELL will discuss and review the reported toxicity. If no grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity was presented, the safety part will be closed and then the expansion part will begin. If a grade 3 toxicity was presented and after the team evaluation, another 3 patients will be included in the safety part. The same toxicity evaluation will be applied in this new safety part.\n\nPatients in both the safety and the expansion part will have a weekly visit during treatment phase followed by the end-of-treatment visit. Onwards, all patient will enter in the progression follow-up phase. In this phase, along with the progression visits, patients will also have the safety evaluation. Safety evaluations will be performed every 8 weeks (after the las dose of AloCelyvir) during the first 48 weeks.\n\nA subject may elect to discontinue AloCelyvir at any time for safety, medical, or personal reasons. Patients who choose to discontinue study drug prior to the end of the 8-weeks treatment period will be followed in the progression follow up period and continue to undergo regularly scheduled disease assessment until documentation of disease progression or start of an alternative anticancer treatment. Also, patients that have received at least 1 dose of AloCelyvir will also initiate the safety evaluations.\n\nAll subjects will be followed for overall survival and all post progression cancer treatments administered will be recorded. Subjects may at any time, withdraw consent for further study participation. A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by mail, phone, or other means as much as possible to gather information such as the reason for failure to return and the status of treatment compliance, presence or absence of adverse events, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms, and the information will be recorded in the eCRF.\n\nSubjects who early withdrew from the study or treatment will be discontinued for 1 of these primary reasons: adverse event(s), lost to follow-up, subject choice, progressive disease, or administrative/other. In addition to the primary reason, the subject may have indicated 1 or more of these reasons as secondary reasons for discontinuation. Study disposition information will be collected on the appropriate eCRF. A subject removed from the study for any reason may not be replaced.\n\nSafety will be assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs including all CTCAE grades (for both increasing and decreasing severity) and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular monitoring of hematology and clinical chemistry; physical examinations; and regular measurement of vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) as detailed in the schedule of visits and procedures.\n\nSafety evaluation will be performed by PI in each visit, all findings will be collected in the eCRF and, when applicable, will be expedited informed to Sponsor according to what is detailed in Assessment of Safety section. Coordinating Investigator will be the principal contact in IDIBELL for pharmacovigilance surveillance and will be informed by the UICEC of each new SAE received and will participate on the management of study emergent toxicities. Furthermore, a monthly report with all new SAE reported by sites will be distributed both, to sites and Sponsor. Annual Safety Reports (DSUR) will be elaborated with the cumulative safety information of the trial and submitted to Coordinating Investigator, Sponsor and Industry Partner, before sending to Competent Authorities as required by current regulation for clinical trials.\n\nAdditionally, the Principal Investigator together with the head of the Pharmacovigilance Team of the UICEC and the Clinical Trial Unit at IDIBELL will meet monthly to discuss all SAEs reported . They will meet also every time a Grade 3-4-5 toxicity is reported to asses causality to AloCelyvir and oversight safety profile of the Study. Also, the will meet after the 3 first patients in the safety part of the study have received the first 4 infusions of AloCelyvir.\n\nIf at any time safety profile of the study is not acceptable, corrective measures will be implemented by the Sponsor, otherwise the study would be halted."
