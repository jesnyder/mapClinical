The safety analysis will be based on subjects who experienced toxicities as defined by CTCAE, v5.0, the attribution to drug, time-of-onset, duration of the event, its resolution, and any concomitant medications administered will be recorded. AEs will be analysed including but not limited to all AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes. Furthermore, specific immunerelated adverse events (iris) will be collected and designated as immune related events of clinical interest (ECIs)."
