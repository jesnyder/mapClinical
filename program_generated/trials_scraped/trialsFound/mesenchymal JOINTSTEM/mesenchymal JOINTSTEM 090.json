Following a 2-week screening period, approximately 260 patients will be randomly assigned into one of the following two arms in a 1:1 ratio (1 JointStem : 1 placebo control). After each patient completes 6-month visit (Visit 5) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis."

                              "degenerative arthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It is estimated that 26.9 million Americans 25 years old or older have clinical degenerative arthritis of some joints, with a higher percentage of affliction in the older population. Its clinical manifestations include joint pain and impairment to movement, and surrounding tissues are often affected with local inflammation. The etiology of degenerative arthritis is not completely understood; however, injury, age, and genetics have been considered among the risk factors.\n\nDegenerative arthritis is a progressively debilitating disease that affects mostly cartilage, with associated changes in bone. Cartilage has limited intrinsic healing and regenerative capacities.\n\nDue to the increasing incidence of degenerative arthritis and the aging population coupled with inefficient therapeutic choices, novel cartilage repair strategies are in need.\n\nThe availability of large quantities of MSCs and their potential for ready chondrogenic differentiation after prolonged in vitro expansion have made MSCs the most hopeful candidate progenitor cell source for cartilage tissue engineering.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue and cultured, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery.\n\nIt will be stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."
