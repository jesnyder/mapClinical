Following a 2-week screening period, approximately 140 subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the following two arms in a 1:1 ratio (1 JointStem : 1 Placebo). After each subject completes 48-Weeks visit (Visit 8) and the data management team confirms all individual data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis."

After each subject completes 6-month visit (Visit 6) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.Only subjects who are assigned will be requested to visit the study center for 9-month and 12-month follow-up visits (Visits 7 and 8). To see long-term effects of JointStem, all subjects who complete Visit 6 will be requested to visit the study center at 24-month after the injection."
