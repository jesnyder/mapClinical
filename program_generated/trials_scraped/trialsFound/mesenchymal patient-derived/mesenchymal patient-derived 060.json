Using alternative strategies to obtain patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells, an integrative approach will be adopted for defining both the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks perturbed upon the loss of function of KMT2D. Combining the self-renewal potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an epigenome editing approach as therapeutic strategy to rescue the activity of MLL4 will be developed.\n\nA step forward is expected towards the understanding of those the molecular mechanisms governing the aetiology of Kabuki Syndrome (KS) and that the proposed in vitro disease model will provide to the scientific community an experimental system to study the KS. Importantly, the aim is to define the molecular bases of KS and to develop a therapeutic strategy that could ameliorate some of the abnormalities associated with KS."
