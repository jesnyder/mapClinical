                              "This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of ABCB5+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with chronic venous ulcer (CVU). Autologous MSCs will be isolated ex vivo from a small skin biopsy and will be expanded in vitro. The IMP APZ2 containing the ABCB5+ cells will then be applied on the wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia.\n\nPatients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.\n\nThe wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing. The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.\n\nPain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of APZ2 an additional follow-up visit at Month 12 post IMP application is included."
