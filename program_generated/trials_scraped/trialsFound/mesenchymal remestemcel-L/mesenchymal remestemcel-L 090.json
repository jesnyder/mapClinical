                              "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum, which continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons, resulting in a significant burden to the healthcare system. UC is characterized by persistent mucosal inflammation of the colon and rectum with a chronic remitting and relapsing behavior which leaves patients on chronic immunosuppression and hospitalizations to treat the disease symptoms, but unable to cure the disease. Despite the ever-growing armamentarium of immunosuppressive medication, up to 30% of patients still require a colectomy for medically refractory disease.\n\nParticipants with medically refractory ulcerative colitis will be treated by targeted endoscopic delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected into the submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.\n\nPatients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.\n\nThere will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150 million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24 participants.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory ulcerative colitis."

                              "Diabetes mellitus refers to disorders in which the body has trouble controlling its blood glucose levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is being studied in this trial, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own immune system attacks and destroys the cells that make insulin. These cells are called beta cells. As beta cells are destroyed, less insulin can be made. This causes blood sugar levels to increase above normal and can cause life-threatening hypo- and hyper-glycemic reactions. For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to help control their blood sugar levels. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can lead to a variety of serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, blindness, amputations, kidney disease, and nerve damage. Insulin is the primary method of controlling diabetes by regulating blood glucose levels, but it may not reverse or prevent disease progression. The active ingredient in PROCHYMAL\u00ae is adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have been shown to interact with the immune cells in the body, reducing inflammation and assisting in tissue repair. This study will help determine whether MSCs can protect normal pancreatic tissue from autoimmune attack and repair damaged pancreatic tissue, leading to an increase in insulin production and decrease in circulating blood glucose. The characteristics and biologic activity of PROCHYMAL\u00ae, along with a good safety profile in human trials to date, suggest that PROCHYMAL\u00ae may be a good candidate for addressing Type 1 Diabetes."

                              "Approximately 6300 patients receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants in the United States each year (International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [IBMTR], 2003). Nearly 50% (approximately 3,150) of these patients develop acute GVHD (Goker et al). A fraction of these patients (approximately 870) will progress to the severe stages of the disease, Grades III-IV. It is estimated that nearly 82% of those patients with severe acute GVHD will be steroid refractory (Przepiorka et al., 1995) and of these, only 50% of steroid-refractory patients will respond to secondary and tertiary treatments (Greinix et al., 2000). Thus, roughly 350 patients each year face tremendous odds against survival. In addition, most patients who initially responded to secondary and tertiary treatments have a high risk of dying within the first year (Remberger et al., 2001; Anasetti et al., 1994). Development of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with steroid refractory, acute GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need. Participants will receive standard of care in addition to adult mesenchymal stem cells or placebo."

Patients receiving HCT can develop a life-threatening condition called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donor T cells from the donor bone marrow recognize host cells as \"foreign\" and initiate an inflammatory immunological response. The standard of care for treatment of acute GVHD consists of intravenous delivery of methylprednisolone starting on day 1 and continuation of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. This regimen of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may relieve symptoms of GVHD, but some patients are refractory to current standard of care treatment. For treatment-refractory patients with grades III-IV GVHD mortality is approximately 80%. A therapy that could effectively suppress the immunological response from GVHD and help repair the damaged tissue could significantly decrease the mortality rate from this disease."
