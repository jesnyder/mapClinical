Cymerus\u2122 refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus\u2122 process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique."
