Mesenchymal stem cells exhibit immunomodulatory and anti- inflammatory properties by the use of paracrine effects. Exosomes as a vehicle for signaling, are responsible for a major part of cell to cell signaling. The preclinical animal studies manifested high safety and efficacy for MSC derived exosome treatment on various fistulas and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Placenta-MSCs derived exosomes in treatment of patients with complex preanal fistula (non-crohn's) in phase I and II of clinical trial."
