Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in treating a Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa.\n\nThis study is a follow-up study without intervention.\n\nOther Names:\n\nAllogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells"
