The patients who were enrolled in this study were those who did not make any improvement after administration of 10 mg/kg of intravenous infliximab and seton placement. Patients were excluded if they had anti-TNF \u03b1 treatment for less than six months, had no prior surgical interventions, or had a history of malignancies or immunodeficiency diseases. Pregnant patients were also excluded.\n\nMSCs in third passage 3 were cultured in T175 flasks with D-MEM F12 culture medium (Gibco) supplemented with Pen/Strep, Strep, and 10 % exosome depleted FBS(Gibco) for 48 hours at 37 \u00b0C with a CO2 concentration of 5% at and humidity of 90 % humidity. Under 5% CO2. The conditioned media of MSCs (CM) were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 400\u00d7g to eliminate suspended cells, 30 min at 2500\u00d7g to remove debris and apoptotic bodies, and then ultracentrifuged for 120 min at 100000\u00d7g (Beckman, USA). The supernatants were collected and further ultracentrifuged for 120 min at 100000\u00d7g. Then the pellets containing exosomes were dissolved in PBS.\n\nTo verify The production of MSC- derived exosomes, vesicle protein content was measured by Bradford colorimetric assay (BCA) from 100 ml of CM. The size distribution of MSC- derived exosomes were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Moreover, to assess the expression of CD9, CD63 and CD81 were confirmed with flow cytometry and western blot., FITC mouse anti-CD63 (BD Pharmingen) and PE mouse anti-CD81 (BD Pharmingen) were used as reagents. Furthermore, the morphology and size of isolated exosomes were assessed using TEM by the previously set protocol in the previous study.\n\nThe procedure was undertaken in the operation room, and the patients were NPO 6 hours before the operation with intravenous sedation and oxygen supplementation with a mask. The patients, placed were placed in a lithotomy position. The external fistula opening was inspected, the tract was palpated, and using an Eisenhammer Retractor, the internal orifice was exposed seen. The lot was irrigated with saline several times using a small catheter to clear the pus and fecal material. After irrigation, a flexible fistula probe was inserted into the tract. Using the probe as a guide, we injected 5 mL of exosome solution into the tissue surrounding the lot. The injection depth was about 2about 2-3 mm of the soft tissue and sphincters of the anus. After the injection, the tract probe was extracted, the patients were under observation in the operation recovery rooming room recovery for 3 hours, and vital signs were monitored. The patients were then transferred to the surgery ward and were observed for 48 hours. The patients were again examined under sedation in the operation room for further evaluation six months after injection."

                              "Symptoms of Peyronie's disease include penile pain and curvature of the penis that prevents penetration and/or causes erectile dysfunction (ED). It is characterized by plaques that form along the top or bottom side of the penis inside the tunica albuginea; the plaque begins as a localized inflammation then develops into a hardened scar. Cases can range from mild to severe. In several cases, the hardened plaque reduces flexibility, causing the penis to curve during erection. The sexual problems as a result can lower a man's self-esteem and interfere with a couple's physical and emotional relationship.\n\nThe cause is unknown; however, possibilities include trauma, inherited conditions, Vitamin E deficiency, diabetes, and vascular disease.\n\nConservative treatments used in the acute phase (initial onset of symptoms) include oral therapies. Vitamin E and antioxidants can decrease the build-up of harmful chemicals that can cause injury to tissue. It is often used as the traditional treatment; it is inexpensive and with proper dosing, there are minimal side effects. Other oral agents include Potaba (aminobenzoates potassium); however, it is expensive ($1000 per year) and has associated gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nOther therapies involve injections directly in the plaques (intralesional) with chemicals such as collagenase or calcium-channel blockers.\n\nSurgical therapies are offered once the disease is stable (symptoms present for one year). Invasive surgical options consist of correction of the penile curvature or the placement of a penile prosthesis to straighten the penis to allow for erections.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for a variety of medical treatments to repair and regenerate acute and chronically damaged tissues. These cells have the potential to repair human tissue by forming cells of mesenchymal origin, such as cartilage, bone, fat, muscle, and blood vessels. Most research has focused on bone marrow derived stem cells (BMC) however the process for harvesting the cells is invasive, painful, and yields a low cell count. The human placenta offers an alternative source form MSCs. Placental Matrix-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (PMD-MSCs) are compromised of a novel cellular repair matrix derived from placental mesenchyme. Mesenchyme is the meshwork of embryonic connective tissue in the mesoderm, from which are formed the muscular and connective tissues of the body and also the blood vessels. PMD-MSCs provide the extracellular matrix viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that coordinate the tissue repair process, regenerative growth factors, and anti-inflammatory cytokines required to regenerate the damaged vasculature of the penile corpora.\n\nThe research proposed here will establish the safety and feasibility of utilizing intracavernosal, intralesional injections of PMD-MSCs to treat Peyronie's disease with the intent of avoiding surgery."

ED is a physical condition triggered by a man's mental, emotional, and medical state. Defined by the repeated and consistent problem sustaining an erection suitable for sexual intercourse; ED can lead to performance anxiety and depression as a result partners of men with ED also suffer emotional and psychological effects.\n\nLifestyle, smoking, medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and vascular problems, prostate cancer and medication side effects all can contribute to the cause of ED.\n\nConservative treatments can begin with lifestyle change; natural remedies include the use of herbs such as L-Arginine, Ginko, Zinc, and Yohimbe. Prescription medications known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are often used but are costly. other therapies involve the penis pump/penis vacuum, penile implants that offer a permanent solution and surgery to improve the blood flow to the penis can improve erections.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for a variety of medical treatments to repair and regenerate acute and chronically damaged tissues.

                              "Historically, treatment of MMC was limited to post-natal surgery to close the dura and skin over the spinal cord to prevent meningitis, which had no effect on motor function. The potential benefit of earlier intervention was realized when prenatal ultrasound of patients with MMC early in gestation revealed near-normal leg movements despite displaying paralysis at birth. This finding gave credence to the two-hit hypothesis that paralysis was progressive during prenatal life and suggested that fetal intervention could prevent the secondary damage to the spinal cord. Fetal repair of MMC did confer improvement in motor function of children treated in the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) randomized controlled trial. The promising results of the MOMS trial demonstrated the potential for improvement of paralysis for these patients, but distal motor function still remained severely impaired in the majority of patients with MMC with standard in utero repair alone. While this demonstrated that the ideal time to intervene to prevent paralysis is in utero with the goal of preventing the accrual of ongoing damage to the spinal cord, there is still room for improvement. The remarkable regenerative capacity of the fetal environment combined with regenerative capacity of placental mesenchymal stem cells offers potential for augmentation of the fetal repair of MMC with a novel therapy to further reduce and repair the sustained spinal cord damage."

The main clinical features are back pain and progressive stiffness of the spine. Oligoarthritis of the hips and shoulders, enthesopathy, and anterior uveitis are common, and involvement of the heart and lungs is rare. The current understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder is limited.It mainly about to hereditary susceptibility (eg hla-b27),infection and autoimmunity.\n\nAlthough traditional drugs, such as Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs such as MTX,SASP OR thalidomide) and steroids have been used in the treatment of AS, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response to these drugs is not satisfied. Addition, the severe side effects of these drugs have also been observed. The management of AS patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed. Human MSCs isolated from human umbilical cord/placenta have been shown to have immunoregulatory, immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC transplantation in the AS patients.\n\nThis study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MSC transplant +DMARDs therapy (experimental group) or DMARDs therapy (control group). Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. After 3 months, patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After six and twelve months from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated."

This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

In patients who survive ARDS, regardless of the pathology, there is evidence that their long-term quality of life is adversely affected.\n\nThe rationale for the dose and dosing regimen proposed in this study is based on the safe administration and benefits of this treatment regimen reported to us last year by physicians trying to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. In those reports, the intravenous route of administration was used. It has been reported that dosing every 2 days amplified the benefit of the combination of exosomes and mesenchymal stem cells. It has been suggested based on clinical experience that the exosomes and MSCs are complementary to one another as well as enhancing the innate abilities of both.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, intravenous infusion of a mixture of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 was reported to benefit hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 related ARDS. This study is designed to systematically explore the risk and benefits of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS.\n\nThis is a proof of concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122, versus placebo, for use in the treatment of moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19.

Severe respiratory consequences of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, have prompted urgent need for novel therapies.\n\nCell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - common manifestation of cytokine storms, and the cause of death in many COVID-19 patients.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells are a powerful immunomodulator, they secrete many anti-inflammatory biologically active substances (cytokines) that reduce the inflammatory process in the lungs. Also mesenchymal stem cells secrete numerous growth factors that contribute to the recovery of not only the affected lung tissue but also other organs."

Recruitment will be done in two parts as participants will self-select to participate in one of two study groups. All participants who elect to have the procedure done at the initial consultation, meet inclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 1. Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection. The T1 and T2 data collections will use the same data collection procedures and questionnaires."

                              "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of one and two intravenous infusions of human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC), the first administered in the first 48 postnatal hours, and the second at two months postnatal age, in term and near term infants with moderate to severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). This is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one or two intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with moderate to severe HIE who are recipients of therapeutic hypothermia. Infants born at 36 0/7 weeks gestation or later who have moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are receiving therapeutic hypothermia will be eligible to participate. Investigators project an accrual of 6 patients. All infants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of hCT-MSCs. The first cohort of three infants will receive a single dose in the first 48 postnatal hours. If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three infants will receive two doses, with the first dose given in the first 48 postnatal hours and the second dose given approximately two months after the first dose.\n\nThe potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization. Another risk of this study is loss of confidentiality or privacy. Every effort will be made to keep the infant's medical record confidential. The results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and statistical testing as appropriate. Continuous secondary endpoints will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, CV%, median, minimum, and maximum."

The downstream effects of the intrauterine exposure to diabetes and gestational lipotoxicity will be tested in the infant: 1) at birth by studying adipogenic pathways and mitochondrial function in umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells cultured in myogenic conditions[13], and 2) by studying metabolic flexibility in the infant in a whole body infant calorimeter in response to a standardized meal.\n\nMothers will be enrolled between (33-35 weeks of gestation) and their infants will be enrolled between 10-30 days of life with the following aims.\n\nAim 1. Characterize metabolic flexibility and lipotoxicity in diabetic and non-diabetic pregnancies.\n\nHypothesis 1A: In response to a standardized meal in late pregnancy, diabetic pregnancies will be metabolically inflexible (blunted switch in RQ from the fasted state to the postprandial state) compared to non-diabetic pregnancies matched for maternal age and pregravid BMI.\n\nHypothesis 1B: Placenta from diabetic pregnancies will have higher lipid content, reduced mitochondrial content and lower rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption compared to placenta from non-diabetic pregnancies.\n\nAim 2. Test whether intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes infers disordered substrate oxidation in offspring at birth (in myocytes cultured from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells) and early in postnatal life (metabolic flexibility in response to a standardized meal).\n\nHypothesis 2A: Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells cultured in myogenic conditions from diabetic pregnancies will have greater lipid content, reduced mitochondrial content, and lower rates of mitochondrial electron transport oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation.\n\nHypothesis 2B: In response to a standardized meal, offspring of diabetic pregnancies will be metabolically inflexible (blunted switch in RQ from the pre- to postprandial state) compared to offspring of non-diabetic pregnancies."
