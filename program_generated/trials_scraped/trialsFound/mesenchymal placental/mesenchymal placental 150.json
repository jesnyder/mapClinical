The injection site (medial, lateral, patellar) will be determined based on the side with the most joint space from the findings of the most recent x-rays. The Physician will insert the needle fully into the joint space and begin to expel the fluid. He will achieve a continuous injection flow as he withdraws the needle back out of joint space. Immediately following the SURGENEX SurForce\u00ae injection, an injection of Predictive Biotech CORECYTE(TM) (1 cc) allograft umbilical cord-derived Warton's Jelly tissue matrix will be administered. This will be done using the exact same protocol as the SURGENEX SurForce\u00ae injection."

Cord tissue is harvested from the placentas of male babies delivered by elective C-section after a normal, full- term pregnancy."
