                              "The problem of the incontinence imposes considerable strain on the child and their parents. These patients suffer from a long-life handicap and they need support and follow-up. The cost associated with these diseases has clearly been illustrated to be a major component in the healthcare spending picture, may be adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to healthcare cost, as well as loss of productivity in the work force. Fecal incontinence treatment has been a difficult challenge for surgeons for several generations until now the current traditional surgical result is unsatisfactory. Mesenchymal Stem Cells injection may represent a new attractive treatment option for anal sphincter lesions. Moreover, experimental injury of muscle of anal sphincter in rats has been successfully treated with stem cells injections. In this study, the investigators will shed more light on the ability of Mesenchymal Stem Cells to induce myogenesis and regenerate anal Sphincter of patients with fecal incontinence. It will be very useful to many Egyptian patients."
