Stem cell research in animals has been an ongoing program in the west with fruitful results. Current challenges with the use of stem cells in clinical practice will be solve the many unanswered queries. To study the potential therapeutic effects of local Mesenchymal Stem cell injection in children presenting with fecal incontinence (FI) after posterior sagittal ano-rectoplasty (PSARP) operation for high imperforate anus. Children whom suffering from FI after PSARP for high imperforate anus will included in this study. Autologous MSC from the upper posterior iliac crest bone marrow sample will be extracted from patients under general anesthesia, in a suitable clean operation room. Will be Cultured and injected into the external anal sphincter defect using direct pena stimulator or ultra sound guidance. Then followed up for 180 days post injection, to assess the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to induce myogenesis of the anal Sphincter of patients with FI after PSARP."
