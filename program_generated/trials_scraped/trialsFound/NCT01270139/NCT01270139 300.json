The end point in this study was cardiac event-free survival during follow-up, starting at randomization. Cardiac events included cardiac death, myocardial infarction and unintended revascularization. Cardiac death was defined as sudden death, death after the onset of symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia and death due to heart failure. Noncardiac death was defined as death due to all other causes. Myocardial infarction was defined as an increase in cardiac enzymes or new pathologic Q-waves on the ECG, or both. Unintended revascularization was defined as PTCA or CABG performed due to worsening of the patient's clinical condition, rather than the PTCA or CABG assigned by the revascularization team when patient management was determined.",

In all patients, measurements were performed in two segments on site of intervention while 960 seconds. The artery diameter was calibrated against the contrast-filled tip of the catheter. Vasoconstriction to acetylcholine was defined as a 3% change of the mean lumen diameter after infusion of the maximal dose of acetylcholine.
