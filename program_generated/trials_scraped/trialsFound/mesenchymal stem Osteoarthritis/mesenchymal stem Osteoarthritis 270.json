Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the \"no pain\" anchor and the participant's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. The recommended cut points for VAS are: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).",
                              "The KOOS questionnaire assesses the participant's opinion about their osteoarthritis and associated problems. It consists of 5 subscales; pain, symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL) function, sport and recreation function, and knee related quality of life (QoL). The pain subscale has 9 items and response options are given on a 5-point Likert scale where 0 = no problems and 4 = extreme problems. Scores are transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 with 0 indicating extreme symptoms and 100 indicating no symptoms."

It is a 24-item patient-reported questionnaire with a total score ranging from 0 to 96. The sub-scores range from 0 to 4 for each item with a higher score indicating a more severe OA symptom. The WOMAC includes 3 domains: (1) Pain: 5 items (score range: 0 to 20), (2) Stiffness: 2 items (score range: 0 to 8), and (3) Functional limitation: 17 items (score range: 0 to 68).\n\nFor ease of interpretation, WOMAC scores (including total scores and sub-scores) will be linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale."

This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms.
