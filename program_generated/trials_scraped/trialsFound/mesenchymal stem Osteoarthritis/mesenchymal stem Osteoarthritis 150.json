Stem cells will be separated from fat cells in the adipose tissue then activated in Tissue Culture Lab at Research Center- Jeddah. The activated stem cells will be injected into the knee joint via 22G spinal needle. The intra-articular stem cells injections will be performed under Ultrasound guidance at the theater under spinal anesthesia. Each patient will receive 1.0\u00d7 108 stem cells in 3 mL of normal saline."

An abdominal fat liposuction is required to obtained Celstem\u00ae. The preparation of the product is carried out exclusively in a clean laboratory room under the conditions described by the AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) standards. The treatments application is carried out on the same day of the extraction, at some point between the next 6 hours from the end of the extraction. Firstly, ultrasound joint evaluation is performed. Under sterility measures, intraarticular infiltration of SVF treatment is performed at affected knee or knees. Previous synovial fluid aspiration is performed, if required. Once the procedure is completed, rehabilitation recommendations and clinical follow-up information is provided."

Bone marrow aspirate concentrate is chosen as a source of mesenchymal stem cells, because of safe and easy procedure.\n\nBone marrow aspiration is done under local or general anesthesia, depending on the individual case. Around 50 cc of bone marrow is aspirated from the posterior iliac crest after proper sterilization using bone marrow aspiration needle (size according to the patient) and collected in heparinized syringes. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) are obtained by centrifugation. The isolated MNCs are checked for viability manually and confirmed on automated cell count machine.\n\nThe separated MNCs is administered intra-articularly immediately after centrifugation."
