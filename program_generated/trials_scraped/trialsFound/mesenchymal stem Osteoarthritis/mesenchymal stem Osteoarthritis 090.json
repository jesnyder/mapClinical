                              "There are more than 100 types of arthritis, and the most common ones are rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The main cause of its pathogenesis is the compensatory hyperplasia of the articular cartilage caused by the body's degenerative changes, which will eventually cause the joint to partially or completely lose its function.\n\nIn the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made to treat OA. The treatment of OA changes with the development of the patient's condition. At present, there are many diagnosis and treatment options for knee OA, including conservative treatment and surgical treatment. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to postpone or terminate the course of OA.\n\nCell therapy for OA has developed rapidly in recent years and has received widespread attention. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with potential of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells are extracted from the patient's body and then implanted back. Their ability of regeneration and reproduction can fill the damaged cartilage tissue, so as to achieve an effective treatment of the joint damage.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction of joint pain, and restoration of joint function."

                              "Knee osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Treatments involve high costs in terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded \"in vitro\" and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has demonstrated that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation through its action on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one carried out in an equine by our research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy evidence proposed treatment protocol. Our research group has also experience in preparing clinical-grade MSC from bone marrow for other clinical trials and has all the necessary facilities and permissions to comply with GMPs imposed by recent EU legislation. Finally, our clinical team has a wide experience in regenerative therapies in several previous clinical trials for bone and cartilage.\n\nWe present here an alternative proposal, aiming to anti-inflammation and regeneration by injection of single dose of mesenchymal stem cells expanded from autologous bone marrow by the GMP-complying IBGM-Valladolid procedure (MSV). Treatment involves two non-invasive surgical procedures with low morbidity: obtaining bone marrow under local anesthesia and sedation, and 4 weeks later, articular injection of the cell product (20 millions MSVs). The injection of cells does not even require anesthesia and obtaining bone marrow requires an outpatient admission two hours following safety criteria.\n\nPatients will be evaluated clinically, including pain score (VSA), pain and disability indexes (WOMAC and Lequesne) and life quality (SF-36), and by radiologic and MRI procedures no contrast and allowing quantification of morphological and structural changes of the cartilage region studied (MRI T2-mapping).\n\nThe design of the study is an open-label prospective, multicenter study. It will recruit 12 patients with osteoarthritis of II-IV Kellgren and Lawrence grades, Patients will be evaluated clinically by previous studies imaging (X-rays and MRI). If they are eligible for the study we shall provide them information about the clinical trial with the \"Patient Information Sheet, quoting them for the Inclusion Visit. In the \"Inclusion Visit\" if the patient decides to participate in the test should sign the Informed Consent Document and a schedule for MRI and X-rays will be scheduled. The results of this exploration will be considered the standard to which compare any given change in the controls at 6 and 12 months. On this visit, routine preoperative examinations are performed (EKG, chest X-ray AP, basic analytic coagulation tests and identification of HIV, Lues and hepatitis B and C and the valuation by the Internal Medicine Service).\n\nDuring the visit V0 we shall verify that all inclusion criteria persist and not exclusion criteria have appeared, and we shall program V1 (to obtain bone marrow) and provide a preliminary date for MSV injection 4 week later (V2). After application, the patients will have follow-up schedule at 8 days (V3), 3 (V4), 6 (V5), 12 (V6) and eventually 24 months (V7) as detailed below.\n\nV0: Eligibility. Clinical History. Analysis, Imaging test. Programming of the following visits V1 (day 0): Bone marrow aspiration under local anesthesia and sedation V2 (day 23). MSV Implantation. V3 (+8 days from Implantation): Security evaluation. V4 (+3 months from Implantation): Security evaluation.

All drop out subjects could get another treatment.\n\nInformed consent all of subjects must be filled and signed up before ruled in this study.\n\nAs soon as after delivery, umbilical cord is collected and processed in sterile specimen 0,9% NaCl at 4oC during 8 hours. The umbilical cord transported to the laboratory and cultured in GMP lab, at UPTTK Sel Punca Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Cellular viability and proliferation are evaluated after cell characterization test by flowcytometer.\n\nSterility test are done three times to ensure cellular sterility. Subjects are positioned in supine position, site of injection are determined by the operator. Injection from superolateral or superomedial in extension knee position, injection from anterolateral or anteromedial in flexion knee position. Aseptic and antiseptic in site of injection use povidone iodine 3 times, then swab by alcohol. Local anesthetic by lidocaine 1% is injected subcutaneously.\n\nMonitoring at the site of injection encompass allergic reaction, pain, and swelling. Patients are approached to be followed up every three months, in 1st ,3rd ,6th ,12th month, for clinical examination, VAS, IKDC and WOMAC Score.

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from adult tissues. These are characterized in vitro by their extensive proliferative ability in an uncommitted state while retaining the potential to differentiate along various lineages of mesenchymal origin, including chondrocyte, osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages, in response to appropriate stimuli.MSCs can be induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Centeno et al.in 2008 reported about the beneficial effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis of knee. The regenerative effects of MSCs in osteoarthritis can be due to their ability to differentiate themselves into chondrocytes and structurally repair the articular cartilage. Recently, MSCs have been shown to possess many potent paracrine effects through secretion of various soluble factors which can influence the local tissue environment and exert protective effects with an end result of effectively stimulating regeneration in situ. Recently Amgad etal.in their study reported even more effective results with use of platelet rich plasma along with mesenchymal stem cells. Platelets play an instrumental role in the normal healing response via the localsecretion of growth factors and recruitment of reparative cells. Its use in orthopaedic began early in this decade as PRP was used with bone grafts to augment spinal fusion and fracture healing.\n\nWakitani et al. in 1994 described repair of defects in articular cartilage in rabbits.Murphy et al.studied the effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in caprine knee joints.Quarto et al.reported the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to repair a large musculoskeletal defect with successful healing of a large bone defect in three patients. Centeno et al. reported one case in which they showed that isolated and expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells when percutaneously injected into a knee with symptomatic and radiographic osteoarthritis, resulted in significant cartilage growth, decreased pain and increased joint mobility. Mishra et al. reported that PRP could enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, and that TGFbeta and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which are factors present within PRP, were important for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs.Hence present study is designed to study the efficacy of use of PRP enhanced mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis knee.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of Platelet rich plasma enhanced autologous mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet rich plasma in knee osteoarthritis.\nTo correlate the clinical improvement with the radiological findings."

It is estimated that 26.9 million Americans 25 years old or older have clinical degenerative arthritis of some joints, with a higher percentage of affliction in the older population. Its clinical manifestations include joint pain and impairment to movement, and surrounding tissues are often affected with local inflammation. The etiology of degenerative arthritis is not completely understood; however, injury, age, and genetics have been considered among the risk factors.\n\nDegenerative arthritis is a progressively debilitating disease that affects mostly cartilage, with associated changes in bone. Cartilage has limited intrinsic healing and regenerative capacities.\n\nDue to the increasing incidence of degenerative arthritis and the aging population coupled with inefficient therapeutic choices, novel cartilage repair strategies are in need.\n\nThe availability of large quantities of MSCs and their potential for ready chondrogenic differentiation after prolonged in vitro expansion have made MSCs the most hopeful candidate progenitor cell source for cartilage tissue engineering.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue and cultured, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery.\n\nIt will be stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

It is a degenerative type of arthritis that occurs most often in patients, as the cartilage in the knee joint gradually wears away. As the cartilage wears away, it becomes frayed and rough, and the protective space between the bones decreases. This can result in bone rubbing on bone and produce painful bone spurs. The patient experiences pain that worsens over time.\n\nAlthough current surgical therapeutic procedures to cartilage repair are clinically useful, they cannot restore a normal articular surface, and in many cases, resulted in the growth of inferior quality fibrocartilage. Therefore, techniques and practices have been developed to collect minimally manipulated bone marrow aspirate (BMA), that contains Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMDMSCs) and other endogenous acellular components, from knee OA patients for autologous transplantation in the treatment of their knee OA.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to study arms to receive a BMA injection to the intra-articular knee, subchondral knee, both intra-articular and subchondral knee, or to receive a corticosteroid injection to the knee. A corticosteroid injection is currently the standard of care for osteoarthritis patients having knee pain. All participants will undergo a procedure. Participants will be blinded as to whether they receive a BMA injection or a corticosteroid injection."

Because some patients with articular cartilage defects may progress to osteoarthritis, such defects need to be repaired even though their exact natural course remains obscure. Traditional methods for repair, such as micro fracture, perforations, abrasion arthroplasty, have not produced consistent satisfactory long term clinical results. Transplantation of autologous bone marrow MSCs expanded in culture would be a promising approach in the repair of articular cartilage defects in human osteoarthritic knees. This method is clinically straightforward to perform because autologous cells can be readily harvested and expanded in culture without losing their capacity to differentiate into chondrocytes.

                              "Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.\n\nThe most popular form of autologous MSC therapy has been through the use of autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate (MSCs, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a \"healing\" effect on the environment in which it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\n\nAdipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of MSCs versus that in bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known as stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.\n\nAlthough the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and \"dose\" have not been performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized study arms with different types of MSCs (bone marrow derived MSC, adipose derived MSC, and umbilical cord tissue MSC) and then will be further randomized to receive an injection of the MSC type they were initially assigned to or corticosteroid.

                              "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common type of arthritis diagnosed. KOA is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of articular cartilage. The prevalence of the Knee osteoarthritis will continue to increase as life expectancy and obesity rises. Osteoarthritis is typically a progressive disease that may eventually lead to disability. The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.\n\nThe rate of progression also varies for each individual. Common clinical symptoms include knee pain that is gradual in onset and worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain after prolonged sitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment for knee osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options when conservative treatment fails. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis currently exist. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of KOA."

Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection.

For subjects with bilateral OA knees, only the knee with more severe symptoms will be selected as the target knee. If the severities of the OA symptoms are the same for both knees, the knee with more pain should be selected, where the WOMAC pain score will take the priority over the VAS index. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of the study groups, Chondrochymal\u00ae Group or Control Group, in 1:1 ratio.

                              "Osteoarthritis of the knee (Knee Osteoarthritis, Knee OA) is a joint disease that primarily affects cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within the joint. In people who suffer from knee OA, articular cartilage top is broken down and worn away, resulting in the underlying bones to rub against each other. This friction can cause pain, joint swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM). Eventually, the joint may become deformed and bone spurs may form around the edges. With the advances in biotechnology, cell therapy in the application of cartilage reconstruction has gradually matured. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) injection of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for knee OA. The same cell products used in this trial have been applied in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in Taiwan for the treatment of critical limb ischemia, and so far no treatment-related adverse effect has been observed. In the current trial, allogeneic bone marrow MSCs of up to 4 donors will be isolated. BM MSCs are expanded and applied for a phase I/IIa study in treating 15-24 recipient patients with knee OA. The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first stage is a traditional 3+3 open dose-escalated study design with three cohorts of dosing groups: (1) 1 x 10^7 cells, (2) 5 x 10^7 cells and (3) 10 x 10^7 cells. At the second stage, knee OA patients will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as determined by the results of the first stage. All the study subjects will be followed up to 6 months (24 weeks) after the treatment for safety and preliminary efficacy evaluation, which the latter will include both clinical and imaging study assessments."

                              "Musculoskeletal conditions are common sources of pain. Specifically, osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations).\n\nThis research study involves the participant being randomly placed into one of two groups; one group will have cells taken from one hip, and the other will have cells taken from both hips. Both of these approaches are performed in clinics currently, and both are considered to be standard of care. All bone marrow collected for the purposes of this study will be obtained by the principal investigator while performing the standard procedure. In obtaining these sample the physicians will abide by the standard of care set forth for the Bone Marrow Aspiration Concentrate procedure."

Surgeons have begun to harvest and centrifuged bone marrow aspirate to produce bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) in hopes that the mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow aspirate can stimulate cartilage regeneration in areas of articular cartilage deficiency. This study is a first-in-human blinded randomized clinical trial using labeled BMAC cells in adults diagnosed with grade II-III Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis.\n\nThis is a single site study where 20 cases among eligible patients will be identified and randomly assigned to either the control (no calcified cartilage) or experimental (calcified cartilage removed) group. A power analysis will be performed after 20 patients to determine the total number of patients required to reach adequate power.\n\nA patient will receive an infusion of Feraheme 2 days before the procedure and a baseline MR Pelvis and knee. A nurse will be present at all times during the infusion to monitor vitals. On the day of the procedure patient will undergo harvesting of the bone marrow from the pelvis and arthroscopy procedure involving menisectomy, synovectomy and debridement. Patients in the experimental group will also undergo removal of the calcified cartilage cap. The bone marrow aspirate will be centrifuged and about 5-7 cc of BMAC injected into knee. MRIs will be done at the 2 day mark for confirmation of the labeling of the mesenchymal cells, and at the two week and 3 month mark. Patient related Outcomes will be measured using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Score at 12 months follow up."

After this time interval, the cells are reprocessed and the cell pellet is obtained. Implantation of the cell pellet into the osteochondral defect of the joint after embedding it on a proper scaffold is performed followed by subsequent defect coverage with an autologous periosteal flap obtained from the proximal tibia to seal the defect and maintain the cell pellet in place. The patients will be assessed clinically with scoring systems preoperatively as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively to assess relief of symptoms and joint function. Radiological assessment (X-rays and MRIs)of the affected joints will be performed at the same time points aforementioned to assess integrity of the formed cartilage. Second look arthroscopy and biopsy will also be performed to histologically assess the repair tissue and grade it via arthroscopic grading system according to the International Cartilage Repair Society guidelines."

As it does not use allogenic tissue and is incubated without additional genetic modification or mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.\n\nIt primarily aims to regenerate cartilage, to improve pain and joint function. The intra-articular injection of the investigational product is expected to stimulate the regeneration and growth of cartilage, and to innovatively improve pain and joint function with cartilage regeneration compared to high tibial osteotomy alone."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that affects the articular cartilage over time and is accompanied by alterations to the synovium, subchondral bone, ligaments, and menisci, as well as hypertrophy of the joint capsule.\n\nTherapies are typically palliative and only alleviate pain in a symptomatic way, failing to stop cartilage degeneration and the following breakdown of other joint structures Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to tackle the challenge of creating OA-modifying therapeutics. The potential of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose derived stromal cells fraction also known as stromal vascular fraction has recently being evaluated for chondroprotective efficacy in oa knees.\n\nThe present study was taken to evaluate Clinical Effectiveness without any doubt after administration of Non enzymatically processed adipose derived stromal cells along with platelet rich plasma in large number (140 patients) having moderate to severe knee (stage 3 and 4) with objective MRI assessment and 2 year follow up.\n\nMethods\n\nThe selection criteria included patients 50 years of age or older with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee that was defined by daily pain for the previous three months, analgesic use at least once per week, less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness, and a WOMAC score of 75 in the target knee. Grades 3 and 4 kellergen Radiographic Grading Scale of Osteoarthritis were part of the radiographic qualifying requirements. The exclusion criteria included individuals with clinically significant systemic diseases and patients with evidence of secondary knee osteoarthritis or severe osteoarthritis (joint space width-JSW 2 mm).\n\nThe WOMAC score, developed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities, is a commonly used indicator of patients' subjective ratings of pain, joint mobility, and physical impairment. With 5, 2, and 17 questions, respectively, it assesses three dimensions: pain, stiffness, and physical function. A minimum score is 0, highest score is 96. The maximum score for each subscale is 20, 8, or 68, correspondingly .\n\nIn order to measure the six-minute walking distance (6MWD), a 50 m distance was marked in an internal hallway, and participants were instructed to walk as far and as rapidly as they could during the course of six minutes. The whole distance was calculated and noted.\n\nUsing previously described procedures, antero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were taken with patients standing at a distance of 1 m from the X-Ray source, with the knee completely extended. The joint space width was measured at its narrowest point (minimal JSW). According to a prior publication this trend was indicated by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm over the trial.\n\nAntero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were acquired using the previously described techniques while patients stood 1 m away from the X-Ray source with their knees fully extended. At the joint space's narrowest point, the breadth was measured (minimal JSW). This tendency was shown by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm during the study, in accordance with a previous publication.\n\nPatients were instructed to take etoricoxib at a dose of no more than 90 mg BD after meals if their discomfort was intolerable. They were instructed to take 30 mg of codeine as needed if the discomfort persisted and to report the next day. Aside from any symptoms or indications that the patient reported, laboratory-based hematological and biochemical tests were also performed as part of the tolerance and safety evaluations.\n\nA microscopic examination of the synovial fluid was performed at baseline and two years after the surgery to check for abnormal cell counts. According to the degree to which they interfered with the subject's everyday activities, adverse occurrences were classified as isolated, intermittent, or chronic. The possible causal association between the supplement and the outcome was categorized as Definite/Possible/Probable/Non-Assessable/None. The institutional committee for stem cell research and therapy gave its approval to the project. All of the patients provided written consent to participate in the trial after receiving enough information.\n\nSVF preparation :\n\nWith the help of a 3 mm aspiration cannula and tumescent solution, about 100 ml of fat was collected from each patient's belly and put into sterile, disposable 250 ml conical centrifuge tubes. The adipose tissue underwent two PBS washes before being sonically cavitated by ultrasound at 10 mega hertz ,50 W for 30 minutes with 5-minute intervals of agitation. The SVF was then extracted as a pellet by dividing the suspension into four 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuging them at 500 g for five minutes. To get rid of any remaining enzyme, the pellet was washed twice with regular saline before being resuspended in PBS. The SVF suspension was spun at 500 g for 5 min after being filtered using a 100 m cell strainer. The extra fluid was dumped. The pellet was put back together with regular saline and passed through a 40 m cell strainer. Samples were collected in order to count the number of cells, assess their vitality, and cultivate, and define the stem cells.\n\nPRP preparation: The same donor who provided the adipose tissue's peripheral blood also provided the platelet-rich plasma. ACD Solution A was added to BD yellow top vacuum tubes with 20 ml of peripheral blood, and the tubes were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. To obtain a platelet pellet, the plasma fraction was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. After that, just 3 ml of plasma remained, which was used to resuspend the platelets."

It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

                              "A phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) was performed with primary Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) attended in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation, BSMMU, between January 2018 and December 2021. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of BSMMU for this clinical trial (Reference No: BSMMU/2018/25, dated 01/01/2018). Impacts of a single intra-articular (IA) injection of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) containing mesenchymal stem cells on pain, physical function, stiffness, and cartilage thickness assessed and compared before and after intervention. Patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis (OA) knee included in the study. Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiological scores were used to define OA grade; however, high-frequency musculoskeletal ultrasonogram (MSUS) was used to measure cartilage thickness. There is no standard protocol to follow while assessing cartilage thickness; however, recent work of Podlipska and co-workers would be a worth consideration for using adipose tissue for cartilage regeneration. As medial tibio-femoral joint is the most commonly involved in KOA, here, we consider medial femoral cartilage thickness. The assessment used a commercially available ultrasound device (Samsung Accuvix, 2010, origin- South Korea) with a 15 megahertz linear transducer ML6-15. The patient was positioned supine with the knee in full flexion. A proximal-distal probe sweeping over the anterior-central knee area, medial femoral articular cartilage imaged in an axial plane. Degenerated cartilage signified either loss of surface sharpness or increased inner echogenicity; local or total thinning of articular cartilage. The definitions for articular cartilage degeneration are as follows: Grade 0 - a monotonous anechoic band with sharp hyperechoic anterior and posterior interfaces, Grade 1 - loss of the average sharpness of cartilage interfaces and or increased echogenicity of the cartilage, Grade 2a - grade 1 plus thinning of articular cartilage less than 50%, Grade 2b - more than 50% but less than 100% thinning of articular cartilage, Grade 3 -100% local loss of the cartilage tissue.\n\nA total of thirty KOA was randomly divided into two groups - case and control. Both groups received conventional care for KOA (acetaminophen 1 gram thrice daily for 14 days, quadriceps strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, mind-body, proprioception, mechanical diagnosis, and therapy (MDT) exercises, and activities of daily living (ADL) modifications4, 18-20. Fifteen received six milliliters (ml) single-dose of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) and 3 ml activated PRP). PRP was activated with 0.1 ml calcium gluconate per 0.9 ml of PRP (1:9 ratio). However, no orthobiological product was given in another fifteen participants."

                              "Objectives:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems. Based on limitations of prior research, intra-articular corticosteroids are included as a study group to be evaluated for impact on pain relief and joint functionality in comparison to placebo.\nThe investigators hypothesize that patients who receive an injection of Lipogems will experience a decrease in pain of the affected knee and an increase in joint functionality in comparison to placebo. The investigators also hypothesize that patients who receive an intra-articular corticosteroid will experience decreased pain or improved functionality in the affected joint.\n\nBackground:\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) causes patients considerable joint pain and leads to instability, reduced range of motion, and functional limitations. Pathologic findings of OA include decreased articular cartilage, joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and bone cysts. Currently, treatment options are confined to symptom management only. Options for treatment include: topical preparations, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular injections, and, in severe cases, total knee arthroplasty. Review of recent recommendations shows limitations to all available treatments. Oral NSAIDs have shown relief, but is limited to patients without risk factors or contraindications. Topical NSAIDs are recommended in elderly patients or those with GI risk factors, rather than oral NSAIDs. However, pain improvement took 12 weeks and was not long-lived, potentially due to compliance issues in application. A recent systematic review of intra-articular corticosteroids reported that, due to low-quality evidence, it is inconclusive whether intra-articular corticosteroids provided any short or long-term pain relief. Taylor's review of hyaluronic acid treatment is hampered by the variability of preparations currently on the market and shortage of double-blind placebo controlled studies, but conflicting data is reported. Osteoarthritis Research Society International currently recommends corticosteroid injections for short-term pain relief only, and is inconclusive in recommending hyaluronic acid.\n\nThe aforementioned treatment limitations have generated interest in alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, some with the aim of healing damaged articular cartilage. It is well known that articular cartilage is avascular and lacks innervation, which limits its intrinsic healing and repair capabilities. Chondrocytes, derived from MSCs, have limited potential to replicate, which also limits the intrinsic healing and repair capabilities of articular cartilage. The stromal vascular fraction, containing adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has historically been isolated successfully via enzymatic processes. There has been preliminary support in the literature for reduced pain and improved functional performance in patients who received MSCs as part of treatment. However, approaches to isolate MSCs are costly, time consuming, require extensive lab equipment, and are currently limited by complex regulatory issues.\n\nThus, interest in an alternative isolation method lead to the development of Lipogems. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. Lipoaspirate is harvested and washed in saline solution, then processed through a closed-system device that micro-fragments the adipose tissue. This mechanical process retains the vascular architecture, mature pericytes, and MSCs for autologous injection.\n\nAs new technologies are becoming available for the treatment of OA, it is important that investigators gather high-quality data on their efficacy and outcomes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems. In addition, given the limitations of prior research on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids, the investigators will also include this as an additional study group to compare to placebo. Although Lipogems is relatively new to the United States, it has been used for a variety of orthopaedic arthroscopic applications overseas including the treatment of knee OA and is being used more frequently now in the United States. As of now, there are no published studies reporting the outcomes of patients who receive Lipogems for knee OA. There have been case reports published showing favorable outcomes. Thus, this would be the first study reporting data on the efficacy of Lipogems for pain relief in knee OA in a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample of patients. It would also be the only study to date comparing Lipogems to intra-articular corticosteroids and placebo injections. The investigators feel this study design will provide new insight into the efficacy of Lipogems for pain relief of symptomatic knee OA as well as offer new data on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids in this application."

                              "Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative condition of the knee. Its current management is symptomatic. These patients might eventually need total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With the developments in regenerative medicine, stem cell has been suggested as means to regenerate the knee cartilage tissue which otherwise has little regenerative ability. Initially, stem cells were obtained from bone marrow cells; however, now they can also be obtained from adipose tissue through liposuction. With developments of less invasive liposuction techniques, adipose tissue has been identified as means for autologous mesenchymal stem cells (aMAT). There are two ways of obtaining aMAT form adipose tissue: enzymatic, which has controversies related to Good Manufacturing Practice and low yield, and non-enzymatic method which was recently further developed to a closed-system and directly ready-to-use aMAT producing Lipogems\u00ae. Lipogems\u00ae is FDA-approved for several applications including orthopedic use. A couple of case reports and cohort studies showed its potential use in knee chondropathy. Until now, no clinical trials compared its effect to the knee OA standard of care which is the intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Here, the investigators will study the comparative efficacy of corticosteroid versus Lipogems\u00ae in patients with knee OA.\n\nThis randomized clinical trial will include 48 patients with symptomatic knee OA \u2265 45 years old with no contraindication of corticosteroid and/or Lipogems\u00ae use. These patients will be divided equally into two groups: group S who will receive intra-articular corticosteroid knee injection and group L whose aMAT will be harvested using Lipogems\u00ae and be injected intra-articularly. The knee pain, clinical parameters, and patient-related outcome measures (knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score and Lipogems\u00ae Questionnaire-knee) will be assessed at baseline, 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month. Also, knee MRI will be done at baseline and 6-months to visualize any changes (MRI Osteoarthritis knee score). These outcomes will be evaluated over the 6-month period and the difference between baseline and follow-up will be compared between the two groups.\n\nThis study aims to show the comparative efficacy of Lipogems\u00ae as compared to corticosteroid in knee OA patients and to demonstrate its cartilage regeneration potential, which will ultimately deter surgery."

                              "The cartilage is a unique avascular, aneural tissue that does not regenerate easily once damaged. Chondral defects or damages to articular cartilages due to accidents, necrosis of subchondral bone tissue, or arthritis have become some of the more common disorders today. About 15% of the world's population is reportedly suffering from cartilage and joint damages such as degenerative arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. As population aging progresses and as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of the target patient group is also growing. However, despite ongoing research, an effective treatment for cartilage defects is yet to be discovered. Various different types of treatments are currently in use, such as drug therapy, arthroscopy, and artificial joint surgery. However, they all fail to address the root cause. Complete treatment, or regeneration of damaged or defective cartilage is impossible and continuous drug administration or secondary surgeries are required in many cases.\n\nAs a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized damage to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few life science companies both home and abroad are marketing this method of treatment called 'autologous chondrocyte transplant'. The treatment involves the extraction of healthy cartilage tissue from the patient which is then cultured and transplanted into the damaged site.\n\nHowever, this treatment requires the extraction of chondrocytes directly from the patient and thus causes trauma in healthy articular cartilage. Also, this type of treatment cannot be applied to large lesions, nor is the efficacy satisfactory in patients over the age of 40 whose cellular activation levels are low. Thus, autologous chondrocyte transplant is rather limited in the number of cells harvested and their activation level and is therefore restricted in terms of treatment site, severity of the condition, and the size of lesion. The current technology allows the application of treatments in local cartilage defects but not in degenerative arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The technology needs to be taken up to another level in order to benefit such prevalent arthritic disorders. Treatments using stem cells do not cause damage to healthy articular cartilage as they don't require the harvesting of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients. Moreover, the number of successfully cultured cells is larger due to the excellent proliferation capability of stem cells and thus, mass supply is possible.\n\nThis clinical trial for the stem cell therapies is essential because treatment of cartilage defects with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, known to have the highest level of activity among all adult stem cells, opens the possibility of articular cartilage regeneration even for aged patients and patients with large lesions unable to benefit from existing treatments.\n\nThe biggest challenge faced by nations competing in the field of \"tissue differentiation and regeneration using stem cells\" is the question of whether or not the use of embryonic stem cells is ethical. Chondrogenesis using umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells can not only avoid similar challenges, but also present an innovative treatment mode with significant clinical implications for the patients.\n\nIn the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured, mixed with semi- solid polymer, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery in order to stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their functions."

                              "The goal of the study is to enroll 50 subjects in the bone marrow arm (BMAC group) and 50 in the triamcinolone arm (triamcinolone group). Once part fulfill the inclusion criteria, participants will be randomized to either intervention.\n\nParticipants will be enrolled in a staggering manner for the BMAC arm. The first 4 participants will be enrolled with at least 1 week interval in between these patients. During these weeks, the investigators will obtain results from the BMAC culture and evaluate safety response to the procedure. Participants enrolled in the triamcinolone arm will not be enrolled in a staggering manner, as the safety and efficacy are established as this is part of standard of care for hip osteoarthritis.\n\nParticipants will have the study protocol explained to them and will consent to the study, agreeing to have the bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and hip injection performed. Prior to any interventions, the participants will complete the baseline patient reported outcomes scores, and blood draw outlined in SOA section 1.3\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed during screening. Kellgren-Lawrence grade will be determined by blinded radiologists and co-investigators (Drs. Amer Hanano and Carl Winalski). An average score will be taken.\n\nIn order to blind the patient of the intervention, the triamcinolone group will undergo a \"sham\" bone needling of the bone cortex to simulate bone marrow harvesting (BMH). The posterior iliac spine will be anesthetized and needled simulating a BMH. Following the needling, the group will then receive a triamcinolone injection.\n\nThe process of aspirating the bone marrow used has been described by Dr. Friedlis and Dr. Centeno and will be completed under ultrasound guidance and in sterile fashion19. Multiple small draws of maximum 10 cc will be completed from different locations in the posterior superior iliac spine. The procedure as described is safe and been completed in more than 2000 individuals. Three to six passes are completed on each posterior superior iliac spine and a total volume of 60 cc of bone marrow is aspirated.\n\nThe BMAC group will have bone marrow aspirated using the Emcyte ASPIRE\u2122 needle and subsequently concentrated using the Emcyte PureBMC\u2122 system. 1 cc will be sent for further testing at Biosciences Research Associates and 1 cc will be utilized for endotoxin testing, total nucleated cell counts (TNC), gram stain, and viability. BMAC concentration including TNC will be analyzed on a hematology analyzer, Micros ES 60, immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow.\n\nThe parameters are set below:\n\nParameter Acceptance criteria Total Nucleated cell count (TNC) \u226540 x 106 cells/mL Platelet Concentration \u2265 600 x 106 cells/mL Final volume (from the device) \u2265 7 mL\n\nThe investigators will measure endotoxin concentrations utilizing the Charles River Nexgen PTS point of care instrument. The limit of endotoxin for general medical devices is 0.5 EU/device output. The investigators will abide by this parameter. All testing will be performed immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow and before injection into patient to ensure the device output safety.\n\nRapid sterility will be assessed using a gram stain, performed by a CLIA certified laboratory at Cleveland Clinic Florida. If gram stain is positive, the aspirate will not be injected. Patient will be considered a screen failure. All testing will be performed immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow and before injection into patient to ensure the device output safety.\n\nViability will be measured at bedside, as well as at Biosciences Research Associates. Cells will be stained with trypan blue and subsequently read on an autofocus, automated cell counter. Viability of 90% or more is expected. All testing will be performed immediately after the device concentrates the bone marrow and before injection into patient to ensure the device output safety.\n\nRapid sterility testing will be completed at Cleveland Clinic Florida CAP accredited lab and 14 day sterility will be further analyzed by independent Wuxi AppTec.\n\nThe remaining 5 cc will be utilized as the intervention group injectate. The BMAC will be injected as is and will not undergo any further manipulation and/or dilution.\n\nThe 5 cc BMAC dose or triamcinolone will be injected into a single affected hip joint under ultrasound guidance.\n\nOnce the injection has been completed, patient will be monitored for 15 minutes and discharged home. Participants will be instructed to not use ice or anti-inflammatory medications for at least 6 weeks. For pain control following the procedure, the participant will be recommended to use acetaminophen or tramadol depending on the severity. Heat may be applied to the hip joint in case of muscle tightness. Ice should be avoided at the injection site. It may be applied at the site of bone marrow aspiration.\n\nParticipant will then follow-up in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-procedure to completed PROs and functional assessment with research staff. Participants will be asked to communicate to the Principal Investigator when anti-inflammatory medications are initiated, if necessary. Following the injections, both groups will resume home exercise program which participants had been completing prior to the injection in a pain free approach."

If 0/3 patients experience dose-limiting (DLT) at a given dose level, then the dose will be escalated for next cohort of 3 patients. If 1/3 patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If no other patient experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If DLT occurs in 2/3 or 2/6 patients, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be declared the MTD for the MSC cell infusions in this study."

                              "Glenohumeral arthritis is one of the main reasons for persistent shoulder pain and reduced movement (range of motion, ROM) as it can compromise the work activity and also the normal daily activities, leading to the development of depressive syndromes. The final treatment is shoulder arthroplasty, which is effective but is associated with significant costs and morbidity rates. In addition, arthro-prosthesis is avoided in young patients due to longevity concerns and is not indicated in the early stages of arthritis. Currently, conservative treatments for patients with mild or moderate glenohumeral arthritis include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections, with low efficacy and a significant adverse effect profile, hyaluronic acid infiltrations, with good efficacy in initial treatment, and infiltrations of platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), which have shown beneficial effects in knee arthritis. However, evidence for the glenohumeral joint are limited. In cases not responsive to conservative therapy, and especially in young patients, a valid alternative to the prosthesis is the arthroscopic treatment, with good results in the short term, but with relatively high failure rates that increase over time. Other types of nonprosthetic surgical treatment for chondral-humeral defects have low scientific evidence, with variable and uncertain results. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue, due to the ability to differentiate into chondrogenic line cells, have emerged as cells with great therapeutic potential in patients with degenerative joint disorders. Since the knee joint is the most susceptible to pathology because of its mechanical load, most studies based on stem cell therapy regard the knee joint, reporting promising results in treatment in the treatment of early stages of arthritis. As regards the glenohumeral joint, since the most frequent pathology affects the tendons of the rotator cuff, almost all studies investigate the effect of MSC in the treatment of rotator cuff disorders with or without associated surgical repair techniques. Only a prospective study analyzed the effect of intra-articular MSC injection derived from bone marrow in 34 patients with isolated glenohumeral arthritis, reporting a significant decrease in pain and an improvement in shoulder function measured by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale at about 1 year, although study quality is very low. Since the use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow has proved effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis, our study proposes to evaluate the long-term efficacy of this type of therapy in the treatment of the isolated glenohumeral arthritis."

Unfortunately these studies were largely uncontrolled, underpowered, and/or retrospective in nature. Additionally, a recent prospective, randomized clinical study of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected at a separate time point post surgical intervention has highlighted the ability of MSCs to increase meniscal volume and improve knee pain following injection.\n\nThis will be the first study to examine the effects of autograft BMAC intra-articular injection in a single-stage procedure and in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion. The results of this study, if the null hypothesis is rejected, will have far-reaching implications for the standard of care in meniscal treatment and on OA progression in the knee. Additionally, if the results of this study are favorable in reduction of OA progression this study will change the surgical approach to all axial, synovial joints including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle."

Patients enrolled in this clinical trial will undergo scheduled surgery for the treatment of grade 2-3 OA KL. After enrolment, patients will be assigned to 4 treatment groups:\n\n1) intra-articular injection of BMAC, 2) intra-osseous and intra-articular injection of BMAC, 3) intra-articular injection of at-SVF, 4) intra-osseous and intra-articular injection of at-SVF. Medical history, clinical and radiological features, and serum samples will be collected for each patient at baseline, along with cell counts of each product injected.\n\nThe primary efficacy objective is the mean change from baseline to 12 months in the mean scores of the Pain and Symptoms in the Knee and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales for each arm.\n\nThe KOOS subscale scores of pain and symptoms will be aggregated and averaged as the primary outcome.\n\nSecondary objectives\n\nPatient profiling through the collection of clinical, radiological and anamnestic data, and through high-throughput proteomic analysis of serum samples and validation of differentially expressed markers to identify possible specific characteristics of responder and non-responder patients to each treatment.\nWhole organ magnetic resonance imaging (WORMS) at 6, 12 months from baseline;\nPresence/appearance of structural pathological features detected by MRI at 6, 12 months compared to baseline;.\n\nThis is a post-market clinical investigation of the bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and adipose tissue enriched in SVF (at-SVF) for the treatment of OA.\n\nThe study is a multicentric, open-label, prospective, 4-arms, in male and female Patients, aged between 18 and 75 years , affected by knee OA Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) 2-3.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to develop an algorithm for the determination of the best treatment for each OA patient, the secondary objective is to identify responder patients to each treatment and to correlate their biologic profile, based on protein expression patterns in the blood samples pre and post-treatment, and the third objective is to compare two autologous bone marrow-derived and adipose-derived treatments on different OA phenotype patients. High-throughput proteomic analysis will be performed on the patients' sera from the 10 top and 10 worst clinical performers in each group at 6 months.

                              "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in swollen and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen after rest. Most frequently, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. RA affects between 0.5-1% of adults in the developed world with between 5-50 per 100,000 people newly developing the disease each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning and quality of life.\n\nHerein, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the immunomodulatory effects of bone marrow-derived stem cells administered intravenously and the regenerative and repair potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells transplanted into the joints of patients with RA."

                              "The research consists on one-year follow-up prospective observational study. It involves male and female patients (over 18-years-old) with unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis treated with intraarticular injection of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) treatment developed by Cellab Laboratory (Celstem\u00ae).\n\nThe aim of the study is to assess pain efficacy with SVF treatment for knee osteoarthritis patients. To assess pain, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is used.\n\nSecondarily, the study aims to determine the differences pre-post treatment with SVF of the secondary outcomes measures: functionality, quality of life and disability. Is is used KOOS scale, Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) to assess such measures, respectively. It also aims to describe and evaluate the regeneration of joint cartilage of each individual by systematic comparison of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and one year after SVF treatment, measured by Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scale. Moreover, specific sociodemographic and clinical factors that can predict or influence the therapeutic effects and its correlation to biological data (cellularity, immunophenotype, colony formation potency and sterility) will be identified. Adverse events or side effects related to the treatment will be reported.\n\nBoth primary and secondary outcome measures are evaluated prior to treatment, at 1-month, 6-months and one year after treatment except for the assessment of disability and the radiological features of the articular cartilage, which are performed only before and one year after. The radiological assessment according to MOCART classification is performed by a radiologist. This specialised physician is not aware of patients evolution in order to obtain minimize subjective bias. In addition, SVF product biological data, such as the amount of sample of extracted adipose tissue, effective dose, cellularity, immunophenotype, potency sample colonies and sterility, are collected to better describe the product and to be able to correlate the clinical effect with biological features.\n\nThe study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Nostra Senyora de Meritxell Hospital on September 20th, 2018. It is expected to last 4 years, from 2018 to 2022.\n\nThe sample size is determined using the Sample Size Calculator GRANMO (Version 7.12. April 2012). A random sample of 77 individuals affected of knee osteoarthritis is expected to be sufficient to estimate, with 95% confidence and accuracy of +/- 5 percentage units, a population percentage that is expected to be around 5% in the study population (population of the regions of Andorra and Catalonia). A required replacement rate of 5% is expected.\n\nOnce treatment indication is been performed and accepted by the patient, patients who meet the inclusion criteria (see Eligible Criteria) sign the informed consent. Personal data transfer consent to medical team is also signed.\n\nPatients can be withdrawn if they do not complete the questionnaires in pre-established time and form or if its tracking is lost. Withdrawal of the patient does not represent any prejudice to the patient in the control of his disease or in its treat by the medical team or the Laboratory.\n\nFor clinical data collection, patient's medical history and physical examination, are collected by the principal investigator (PI) or collaborators in every follow-up medical visits. For a better patient compliance with the study protocol, a web platform has been developed (https://www.cellab.com/escalas-de-dolor). It has been designed by PI aided by an external computer team. It allows the virtual patient performance of functional scales all along the study protocol. This tool dumps all data entered by patients into an Excel database, which can be exported for statistical analysis by PI. In addition, the platform warns every time a patient is supposed to fill the questionnaires or even when they do not comply in time and / or form established.\n\nDespite being an observational study, the object under study is a specific treatment of regenerative medicine: SVF treatment developed by Cellab Laboratory (Celstem\u00ae). The main feature of this treatment is that it raises the importance of this study is that the product used is made following strict guidelines manufacturing that ensure its reproducibility, quality and safety. It is approved by the Andorra Government authorities for its application.\n\nIt should be noted that the procedure for obtaining, preparing and applying Celstem\u00ae it is always performed by the same professionals: a plastic surgeon, biotechnologist and a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician (who appears to be the PI), respectively, in order to avoid interpersonal biases in the process.\n\nObtaining Celstem\u00ae requires abdominal fat liposuction. It is performed by a plastic surgeon underneath sedation and local anesthesia in an operating room, under the supervision of a anesthetist. The amount adipose tissue extracted varies according to availability in each patient, with a minimum extraction of 200ml. The extracted tissue is immediately transported (within 1 hour) to Cellab Laboratory in standardized refrigeration conditions. A traceability certificate is filled to ensure its conservation.\n\nThe product's preparation is carried out exclusively in a laboratory cleanroom, following American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) standards conditions of hygiene and biological safety. It requires an exhaustive washing of the fat extracted with saline solution in order to remove both residues of blood or lidocaine and adrenaline used in the extraction process. Then the fat is concentrated and mixed with the enzymatic digestion solution (consisting of collagenase at 0.75 mg / mL). It is all incubated at 37 \u00b0C and stirred for 30-40 minutes. When this process is finished, collagenase is inactivated through human albumin and then again thoroughly washed with saline solution to remove the remnants of undigested fat and collagenase. A concentrated cell suspension in a reduced volume is obtained.\n\nOnce ready, the product returns at the clinic, again under proper refrigeration conditions and with the certificate of traceability correctly complimented to ensure its proper conservation. The application of the treatment is carried out on the same day of the extraction, in some point within 6 hours after the extraction. Under sterility measures, intraarticular infiltration of SVF treatment (Celstem\u00ae) is performed at affected knee or knees. Previous synovial fluid aspiration is performed, if required. Once the procedure is completed, rehabilitation recommendations and clinical follow-up information is provided."

At the same time, 60cm3 of peripheral blood will be taken and centrifugated once, to obtain approximately 3 cm3 of PRP. After activation of platelet rich plasma cells they will be mixed in one syringe with the concentrated BMaC and both will be injected in the hip joint under ultrasound. In all cases four samples of 0.2cm3 will be collected, one with patient's whole blood, one with the PRPs final mixture, one with whole bone marrow aspirate, and one with the BMaCs final mixture, and will be sent to the NSHA Hematology Laboratory for cell quantification. The leukocyte counts and differential (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils) as well as thrombocyte counts in all samples will be determined using Automated Hematology Analyzer (Sysmex). Percentages of mature and immature leukocytes in the bone marrow aspirate and BMaC samples will be determined by standard morphologic examination using slides prepared with the Wright's stain. CD34+ stem cell enumeration in the bone marrow aspirate sample and BMaC will be performed by flow cytometry (Canto II Analyser).The concentration factor of PRP will be calculated from the quotient of the thrombocyte count in whole blood and in PRP. Additionally, IGF-I, VEGF, TGF-b, bFGF, HGF and PDGF will be quantified in serum or plasma and in PRP using commercially available ELISA kits (QuantikineH, ELISA KITS, R&D Systems, USA).\n\nPost-Injection Procedures:\n\nClinic visits will occur at 6, 12, 24, and 48 weeks post-injection to perform clinical evaluations with outcome measures of the patients. All collected data will be statistically analyzed to check the effect of BMAC and PRP intraarticular hip injections in young patients with early OA. The investigators will also document the activity level of all participants (type of sport or activity participated in and the intensity and volume of participation) and correlate it with the outcomes."

                              "Introduction\n\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common and devastating injury among young athletes, and re-injury poses significant threats to both successful return to play and long term outcomes. Graft healing during ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a slow biologic process, that involves graft incorporation into bone tunnel sites, as well as intra-articular graft remodeling . The intra-articular graft remodeling process is known as ligamentization, and occurs in three phases after ACLR. The first phase of early healing occurs between 0 and three months, the second phase occurs between 6 months and one year, and the final phase of maturation occurs after 1 year when the graft appears very similar to the native ACL. The studies that defined these time points biopsied human bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) ACL autografts at different postoperative points, and described changes occurring over time in regards to vascularization, cellular aspects, and appearance of the extracellular matrix in comparison to control ACLs . Unlike animal models which display a necrotic stage, grafts in human models undergo an early vascular invasion, associated with fibroblasts that are converted to a hyper-cellular matrix with only focalized areas of necrosis . This process occurs as early as 3 weeks postoperatively, and increases over time as areas similar to the native patellar tendon with mature collagen and metabolically quiescent cells decrease . This process is the limiting factor in graft healing for bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) grafts, as osteointegration occurs earlier .\n\nThe processes of osteointegration and ligamentization are responses to the new intrasynovial milieu and physical forces that the new graft is exposed to. During these healing and restructuring processes, failure load and stiffness of grafts decreases by up to 24% at 7 weeks, before strengthening to their potential . This contributes to the long recovery period for ACLR, and the risk of re-rupture during this period. Advances in biologic adjuncts to accelerate and improve this healing process would have a significant impact on the management of ACL injuries.\n\nRecently, biologic preparations of various growth factors have been developed to safely and effectively treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including tendinopathies and arthritis . Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) consists of undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells that are concentrated and applied to the injury site . Previous studies have demonstrated this treatment to offer the pluripotent potential of the cells to impact healing, regeneration, biomechanical strength, and reducing bone-tunnel enlargement . Investigators have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell reinforced grafts had a significantly higher failure load and stiffness as early as 8 week post-operation in a rabbit model, suggesting an added benefit of advanced healing . Using BMSCs can offer a novel method to enhance tendon graft osteointegration. While there have been numerous laboratory studies researching the effect of mesenchymal stem cells, there lacks evidence in translation to the clinical setting. Silva et al performed a study where they injected bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) into patellar tendon grafts to examine for increased graft-to-bone tunnel integration. They did not find a significant difference of tunnel integration on MRI imaging, but they did not examine the intra-articular portions for the effect on the ligamentization process, nor did they examine the effect on clinical examination and patient reported outcomes .\n\nQuantitative MRI is a non-invasive method to interrogate tissue properties and evaluate the biochemical composition of tissues. The T2* sequence gives information regarding tissue graft volume, water content, fiber alignment, and tissue density. Median grayscale values (a measure to determine tissue quality)can also be correlated to maximum failure load, yield load, and linear stiffness of grafts in a porcine model. Increases in MRI signals in ACL grafts have been found to be time dependent, becoming well established by three months, particularly at the distal intra-articular portion near the tibial tunnel . These changes have not been shown previously to be predictive of graft failure, but Investigators have recently also confirmed that normalized T2* signal intensity values of ACL grafts have significant correlation with knee instability related to ligamentization and tunnel healing.\n\nA recent study examined intra-articular graft maturation after platelet-rich plasma gel (PRPG) application, with MRI at month intervals from 3-12 months postoperatively. The intra-articular segment was divided in a proximal, middle, and distal segment, on a scale from 0-3 ranging from completely homogenous to severely heterogeneous. The mean time to obtain completely homogenous bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) graft was 109 days for the PRPG group, and 363 for the control group 8.\n\nWe propose using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T2* mapping to investigate if BMAC treatment at time of ACL reconstruction can accelerate the graft maturation and healing process. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft evaluating the T2* weighted MRI changes of the graft at 3 and 9 months after surgical reconstruction. Additionally, we will obtain patient-reported outcome measures from this cohort to evaluate if BMAC treatment imparts a clinically-significant effect on ACL reconstruction.\n\nStudy Rationale\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of biologic augmentation of ACL reconstruction with BMSCs as measured by magnetic resonance imaging to detect graft healing and integration. Secondary endpoints will include validated patient reported outcome measures, as well as functional outcome using objective examination findings.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe hypotheses of this study are that there will be improved graft healing and integration at three and nine months as measured by decreased signal intensity and heterogeneity on T2* MRI following administration of BMAC during ACL reconstruction compared to the control group. Additionally, patient reported outcomes and physical examination findings will be significantly improved at an earlier time in those who receive the BMAC treatment to their allograft compared to the control group.\n\nStudy Plan\n\nThis study will be a prospective randomized trial of patients undergoing arthroscopic reconstruction of full thickness anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. All patients who sign consent and undergo full thickness ACL reconstruction will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment will continue until 32 patients, 16 in each group, are enrolled. Follow-up will take place at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 24 months."

                              "The field of regenerative medicine and orthobiologics have raised the interests of many clinicians and members of the scientific community. Over the last 20 years there has been a great interest and growth in this field, a Scopus search for musculoskeletal and stem cells resulted in over 3000 documents, with more than a third being reviews. A PubMed search in the past 6 years resulted in 52 publications in the last 5 years.\n\nUnfortunately, the fragmentation of regenerative medicine has occured with many clinicians using generalized protocols resulting in little significant clinical improvement or short-term benefits that often fade over time.\n\nThere is still a great deal of research which needs to be done to elucidate how best to utilize the various components of regenerative medicine as well as the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis.\n\nThe ERIPTO study seeks to study a proposed protocol utilizing various components of regenerative medicine including platelet rich plasma (PRP), hyaluronic acid (HA), and human bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC).\n\nIn trauma and normal wound healing collagen is often the initial activator of platelets with development of platelet monolayers over the exposed collagen surfaces as seen in post-traumatic joints. This is opposed to immediate proteolytic cleavage of platelets by thrombin with subsequent immediate release of stored growth factors. Investigations of gene expression within joints following mechanical injury to articular cartilage have been studied. In a shear versus impaction model investigators found an increase in the expression of collagen type 1 following trauma to the articular surface. This expression of collagen may act as an anchor for percutaneously injected PRP in post-traumatic joints to help facilitate steady secretion of growth factors.\n\nIt is known that the average life span of a mesangial cell once delivered into a joint is around 30 days. Only 26% of transplanted cells survive within the joint. This time frame is contingent on providing a proper and hospitable environment for the cell to be injected into. In consideration of the catabolic micro-environment of osteoarthritis it is evident that an arthritic joint, many times, harbors a molecular milieu that is not suitable or beneficial to transplanted mesangial cells and native cells including chondrocytes, type 2 collagen, the extracellular matrix, synovium, as well as subchondral progenitor cells. It can also promote osteogenic differentiation of native cartilage and lead to the progression to end stage joint disease.\n\nResearch is also coming to light regarding the inflammatory niche present in the environment at the time mesangial cells are transplanted and can hold a bearing in regards to trophic factors secreted by the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as the immunomodulatory effects they possess. Toll like receptor stimulation on MSC polarization plays an important role in the development of a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory MSC. Pro-inflammatory factors present in the milieu such as interferon (IFN) gamma or IFN alpha can influence the differentiation down the pro-inflammatory lineage of the MSC and help promote subsequent immune modulation to promote differentiation of the M1 (pro-inflammatory) macrophage, activation of CD8 T cells, as well as increased expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10. [17] If a low level of iNOS is present that can subsequently lead to T cell activation and proliferation via cytokine-induced chemokines. Although this is largely true, expression of MSC induced IL-6 helped promote the differentiation to M2 (anti-inflammatory) lineage.\n\nRecent research has shed light upon a novel concept within post-traumatic and arthritic joints. This is the effect the inflammatory environment and reactive oxygen species can have on native tissue dysfunction, particularly growth factors such as the TGF-B superfamily along with BMP. In 2019 investigators researched native MSC dysfunction with dysfunctional TGF-B possibly as a result of the catabolic milieu in osteoarthritis. TGF-B-induced protein (TGF-Bi) has been seen as a growth factor expressed in MSCs native to joints as well as bone marrow. It has been found to play two roles in normal chondrogenic differentiation.\n\nIn one role it stimulates proliferation and differentiation while in another role it inhibits mineralization and chondrocyte terminal differentiation. It is postulated that TGF-Bi in BM-MSCs helps regulate condensation of BM-MSCs in the early phase of chondrogenesis by bridging action between cells, collagens, and proteoglycans. In their study the investigators came to the conclusion this was achieved by modulation of adhesion molecules ITGB1, ITGB5, and NCAD. In their study the investigators were able to demonstrate the counterintuitive upregulation of TGF-Bi within the bone and articular cartilage of joints afflicted with OA, giving rise to the question of deregulation of native growth factors.\n\nThe investigators postulated either this could be the result of TGF-Bi attempting to reverse calcific changes occurring in chondrocytes of severely arthritic regions of the knee and noted an increased concentration of such within osteophytes and areas of extensive damage. The investigators also suggested a dysregulation of TGF-B family of genes within OA and did note the regulatory role TGF-Bi plays on collagen X, a marker of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Evidence is also coming to light of multiple MSC niches which exist within joints that assist in maintaining cartilage integrity and helping heal microdefects within damaged cartilage. The investigators noted among the MSCs, TGF-Bi was down regulated within the infrapatellar fat pad and BM-MSCs from OA joints and noted that whether BM-MSCs efficiency to repair cartilage lesions in vivo warrants further investigation.\n\nThe role of reactive oxygen species play in dysregulation of native BMP within musculoskeletal conditions has also been studied. The investigators discussed how low levels of ROS are required to maintain undifferentiated MSCs and how ROS (generated by NOX-2 and NOX-4) and BMP play crucial physiological roles in chondrogenesis. In a discussion regarding osteonecrosis and osteoarthritis the investigators note necrotic lesions lead to the increased production of free oxygen radical (O-, H202) with subsequent increased production of BMP-2, seen in necrotic lesions and damaged cartilage from OA patients. Increased H2O2 levels, produced by either NOX activation or inflammation, induce NF-kB activation which enhances expression of BMP-2. BMP2 stimulates proteoglycan synthesis, induces vascularization, promotes endochondral osteogenesis and has anabolic effects on chondrocyte metabolism and function, and is considered a marker for OA severity. Dysregulation of this system can lead to oxidative stress and cell dysfunction which may contribute to various pathologies.\n\nAlso, when considering MSCs capability to promote neocartilage formation, inflammation certainly plays a factor regarding its efficacy. Inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha, IL-1B, and IL-6 hinder MSCs capability in promoting chondrogenesis by the production of excessive free radicals. The role of IL-1B in contributing to an inflammatory microenvironment has also been evaluated. These include cartilage degradation, induction of Ik-B alpha phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor - kappa B (NF-kB), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (may also activate NF-kB), increased expression of ADAMTS-4 (inhibits gene expression of aggrecan and COMP) and reduced gene expression of anti-oxidant enzymes. The investigators discussed how elevated oxidative stress produced by these inflammatory cytokines inhibits the synthesis of cartilage matrix macromolecules (i.e. type 2 collagen and aggrecan), promotes the degradation of articular cartilage in arthritic joints, and inhibits native and implanted mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis.\n\nIt is now known that PRP has various influences on MSCs when combined with MSC treatment including increased proliferation rate of chondrocytes, helping promote chondrogenic differentiation, RUN X 2 inhibition, trapping of NF-KB, and affecting an overall anabolic change in the microenvironment.\n\nIt is now known that mesangial cells play an orchestrating role via paracrine related mechanisms in the expression of anabolic factors including expression of type 2 collagen, well documented anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role, as well as studies demonstrating recruitment of native progenitor cells versus direct differentiation. This is at the heart of what transplanted MSCs do to help in the healing process. As previously mentioned, there is only a 26% survival rate for transplanted cells and there is significant push to find bio-engineering modalities to help support the survival of transplanted MSCs. Among the modalities include transplantation of MSCs with Hyaluronan derived matrices.\n\nBoth CD44 and CD168 are involved in the regulation of growth factor signaling. Implanting MSC within an HA scaffold can help augment communication of MSCs within the joint microenvironment. The investigators also discuss the well documented pleiotropic effects of HA including anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-fibrotic, and chondroprotective effects. As mentioned above, with endogenous MSC dysfunction due to the presence of an inflammatory niche within osteoarthritic joints, there is an immunological response which also contributes to the arthritic milieu within joints. HA has demonstrated immunosuppressive qualities and have seen the decrease in the levels of activated T cells. There is also benefit in utilizing commercially available HA in helping normalize endogenous HA synthesis.\n\nWith the proposed ERIPTO protocol there is a logical approach to achieve more longer lasting and clinically relevant results."
