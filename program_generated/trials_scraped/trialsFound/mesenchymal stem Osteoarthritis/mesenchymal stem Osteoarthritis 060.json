While the available treatments seek to ameliorate pain or improve mobility, these treatments rarely modify the course of the disease, but rather attend to its consequences. For early stage osteoarthritis, treatment is largely limited to addressing the symptoms of inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs do not stop the progression of the condition or regenerates damaged cartilage.\n\nThis is a randomized and open labelled study aimed to determine the efficacy of intra-articular implantation of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis."

Arthritis rheumatoid is an autoimmune disease which causes multi articular arthritis, such as knee osteoarthritis. As the disease progresses the cartilage become frustrated, surrounding bone react to become thicker and inflammation occurs in subchondral bone seen in T2-weighted MRI as increase in signal density. Patients are treated initially by pain management. In patients who don't response to first line treatment invasive treatment like total knee replacement is done. The investigators designed this clinical study with the aim of evaluating therapeutic effects of intra-articular injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in 60 patients with knee osteoarthritis."

Current management of osteoarthritis only aimed to relieve pain but not to resolve the degeneration of cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cell is one kind of adult stem cell that has potency in tissue engineering. Sources of mesenchymal stem cell are bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Researchers want to explore the potential of umbilical cord as the source of allogeneic MSC, because the gaining process of MSC is not invasive. Some countries have started some In vitro studies, Animal studies, and human research, but in Indonesia the study of mesenchymal stem cell implantation from umbilical cord in genu osteoarthritis management has not been reported. This study will be held into two years in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and include 9 participants minimally. The researcher also compares the efficacy and safety of MSC implantation from umbilical cord applied to genu osteoarthritis with synovial artificial and recombinant human growth hormone therapy."

The trial is based in our own previous results with autologous MSC (ongoing NCT01183728 trial). We propose here a multicenter, phase I-II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment of osteoarthritis (degrees II and III and IV). The assay consists of two arms with 15 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given an intra-articular transplantation of allogenic MSC, expanded \"Ex Vivo\" with our GMP-compliant procedure (MSV, PEI No. 10-134, authorized by the Competent Authority; same as in NCT01183728). In the control arm a standard treatment with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid shall be given. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability, quality of life and quantitative changes in structure and composition of cartilage determined by T2-weighted MRI relaxation (Cartigram) for one year."

Osteoarthritis is considered a chronic degenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss of articular cartilage. Pathogenesis can involve all of the major articular tissues including cartilage, synovial membrane, subchondral bone and other connective tissues such as ligaments and tendons3. There is no effective therapy available today that alters the pathobiologic course of the disease.In view of vast role of platelet derived growth factors, mesenchymal cells and its safety, this prospective clinical trial is designed in an attempt to compare the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells enhanced with platelet rich plasma in early stages of knee osteoarthritis."

Treatments involve high costs in terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded in vitro and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has demonstrated that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation through its action on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one carried out in an equine by the investigators research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy evidence proposed treatment protocol.This study is designed to evaluate therapeutic potential and safety of mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of osteoarthritis clinical manifestations.This study is designed to evaluate therapeutic potential and safety of mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of osteoarthritis clinical manifestations."

                              "Many patients with osteoarthritis of the knee fail non-operative measures and elect to have knee arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. If successful, intra-articular mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections into the knee may offer another viable non-operative treatment modality. Additionally, this modality may have reparative or regenerative potential, which could lead to the first treatment for osteoarthritis that treats the underlying disease as opposed to symptomatic control.\n\nAdditionally, there are no acceptable non-surgical treatments for focal chondral defects of the knee. Surgical treatments that do exist have diminished outcomes if performed on patients older than age 30-40 years. If successful, intra-articular MSC injections into the knee would represent the first non-operative treatment for focal chondral defects and also represent a potential option for treatment in patients over the age of 30-40 years.\n\nThis trial will be a prospective, single-center phase I pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in 16 subjects, 8 who have knee osteoarthritis and 8 who have a focal chondral defect in the knee. Patients will undergo a bone marrow harvest procedure at the Dahms Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MSCs will be isolated and expanded. After approximately 2-3 weeks, patients will return for an intra-articular injection of 50x106 MSCs Subsequent study visits will occur on post-injection day 7 and months 2, 6, 12, and 24. Safety of intra-articular injection of MSCs will be evaluated at study visits by interval history, physical examination and assessment of any adverse events that are observed/reported. Additionally, efficacy will be evaluated by having patients complete functional outcome measures including: Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and Lysholm Knee Scale. These will be completed at the pre-treatment visit and then repeated at the 2, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up visits. Lastly, T1 rho and T2 mapping on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess for improved cartilage quality after intra-articular injection of MSCs. An MRI will be obtained at the pre-treatment visit. At the 12 and 24 month follow up visit, additional MRIs will be obtained and analyzed to compare the pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MRIs."

Based on extensive preclinical investigations, the technology of using freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells mixed with proteins seems safe and most effective for a one-step correction of cartilage defect and restoration of the osteochondral complex, because the same mixture can generate cartilage in the vasculature-free knee joint, and bone in the environment of bone defects."

                              "Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is a serious public health problem in the world, it carries a high personal, social and economic impact. Currently, there are no drugs that modify the natural course of the disease. As analgesic therapy becomes insufficient, more invasive measures are applied, ultimately leading to arthroplasty.\n\nThe scientific community has joined efforts to develop new therapeutic approaches that allow the delay and regeneration of injured tissue in these patients. These include cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources. Although most of the clinical studies carried out in different parts of the world with this therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis have shown therapeutic benefit, it is necessary to develop clinical trials with high quality in our population.\n\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Cellistem-OA (biological therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord) in patients with knee osteoarthritis in the Colombian population.\n\nInvestigators proposed to carry out an experimental (clinical trial), randomized, controlled and parallel with 30 participants with knee knee osteoarthritis of the medical complex Fundaci\u00f3n Oftalmol\u00f3gica de Santander Cl\u00ednica Carlos Ardila Lulle. The participants will be randomized into two groups: i) 15 patients who will receive a dose of 2 x 106 Cellistem-OA and ii) 15 patients who will receive an active comparator (acetonide of triamcinolone 10mg / mL), which will be administered by intra-articular injection in the superolateral aspect of the knee. The outcomes to be evaluated will be: (i) decrease in joint pain, (ii) increase in joint functionality, (iii) improvement in quality of life and (iv) improvement of articular cartilage. These parameters will be evaluated at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 25, 28, 32, 36 and 52 post-treatments. Additionally, local and systemic adverse events will be recorded to establish whether or not there is an association between them and the intervention."

Despite advances in diagnosis, the quest for the development of a disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. Human cartilage only has limited regenerative potential. Transplantation is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity of MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells - chondrocytes. The acquisition of MSC does not require invasive surgical intervention or cartilage extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based strategies. The investigators inject allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells to the cartilage lesions in patients via intra-articular injection method, and to investigate the efficacy and safety."

                              "Musculoskeletal conditions are common sources of pain. Specifically, osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations)."

The survival and incorporation of the BMAC labeled cells will be evaluated with MRI using the Ferumoxytol infusion stem cell labeling technique. The second arm of the study evaluating cell fate after injecting stem cells under a rotator cuff repair will also be explored.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to 1) determine which surgical intervention leads to better clinical outcomes as measured by Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 12 months, and 2) determine who long we can track the labeled-BMAC cells in the knee."

The cartilage has no intrinsic ability to repair resulting at long term in function loss in the joints. Currently available treatments are not satisfactory in the long term, the use of mesenchymal stem cells appears to be promising due to their ability to multipotency and immunomodulation properties. This project aims to determine the most appropriate source for regenerative medicine of cartilage stem cells from tissue taken during arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis. These cells will be tested for different chondrogenic markers. The success of this project will consider the implementation of a strategy for regenerative medicine in bone and joint diseases."

                              "In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency, drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.\n\nThe study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial, involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24 months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI."

                              "Knee joint cartilage cells metabolize slowly, and it is difficult to repair themselves after injury. Any knee joint trauma or the progression of osteoarthritis may lead to the progression of cartilage or osteochondral defects. Compared with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), peripheral blood MSCs have better chondrogenic differentiation ability. At the same time, the mobilization of peripheral blood MSCs and the advancement of extraction technology also make it feasible to treat osteochondral damage by using peripheral blood MSCs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of surgical transplantation of autologous peripheral blood MSCs to repair knee joint \u2163-degree localized cartilage injury, and to explore a new treatment for osteochondral defects based on the foundation of the research group's previous research."

                              "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) causes patients considerable joint pain and leads to instability, reduced range of motion, and functional limitations. Current treatment limitations have generated interest in alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, some with the aim of healing damaged articular cartilage. There has been preliminary support in the literature for reduced pain and improved functional performance in patients who receive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as part of a treatment regimen. MSCs can be costly and are limited by complex regulatory issues. This interest in an alternative isolation method lead to the development of Lipogems. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems. In addition, given the limitations of prior research on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids, the investigators will also include this as an additional study group to compare to placebo. There have been case reports published showing favorable outcomes. This would be the first study reporting data on the efficacy of Lipogems for pain relief in knee OA in a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample of patients.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that patients who receive an injection of Lipogems will experience a decrease in pain of the affected knee and an increase in joint functionality in comparison to placebo. The investigators also hypothesize that patients who receive an intra-articular corticosteroid will experience decreased pain or improved functionality in the affected joint compared to placebo."

                              "Unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common finding especially in patients with lower limb malalignment and previous meniscectomy. Among the various treatment options, in recent years there has been an increasing attention towards the use of biologic agents, such as platelet rich plasma and mesenchymal stem cells, as intra-articular injective approaches to relieve pain and restore joint function. Anyway, the sole intra-articular administration of these agents may not lead to satisfactory outcome in a relevant percentage of patients. In fact, unicompartmental osteoarthritis is not only characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, but also by pathologic changes in the subchondral bone, both at the tibial plateaux and in the femoral condyle. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals, in many cases, alterations of the subchondral tissue known as \"bone marrow edema\", which is a sign of bone overload and play a significant role in the progression of unicompartmental OA and is responsible of OA-related symptoms. Therefore, concurrent treatment of both the subchondral bone damage and intra-articular degeneration could led to better outcome for patients affected by unicompartmental OA: the aim of the present pilot trial is to assess the safety and describe the clinical outcome following concurrent intra-articular and subchondral bone application of Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC). BMC is an autologous product rich in mesenchymal stem cells, which have immuno-modulatory and throfic properties and are able to restore the joint homeostasis by reducing the inflammatory distress traditionally associated to OA.\n\nBMC will be collected directly in the operating room from the anterior iliac crest or the tibia by using the MARROW CELLUTION kit (Geistlich, Switzerland), which allows to obtain BMC without the need of centrifugation processes. Approximately 9-10 ml of BMC will be harvested: 6 ml will be injected, under fluoroscopic guidance, in the tibial emiplateaux (approx 3 ml) and in the femoral condyle (approx 3 ml) presenting MRI evidence of bone marrow edema. The remaining amount of BMC will be administered intra-articularly to address articular tissues (cartilage, menisci and synovium). Twenty-five patients affected by unicompartmental knee OA will be included in the present pilot trial and treated in a \"Day-Surgery\" regimen. They will be followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months' after treatment by clinical questionnaires and radiographic evaluations (x-rays at 6 and 12 months, MRI at 12 months' f-up). Any intra-op and post-op adverse events will be documented."

                              "Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative knee condition of the knee which is treated symptomatically. Knee cartilage tissue has little regenerative ability With the developments in regenerative medicine, stem cells might also be used in knee OA. Recently, adipose tissue has been identified as means for autologous mesenchymal stem cells (aMAT) using non-enzymatic method. Lipogems\u00ae is FDA-approved closed-system and directly producing ready-to-use aMAT. Some observational studies showed its potential in knee chondropathy. With no clinical trial done as yet, the investigators will hereby study the comparative efficacy of corticosteroid (current practice) versus Lipogems\u00ae in patients with knee OA. The knee MRI changes, clinical and patient-based outcomes will compared between baseline and throughout till 6 months after treatment. This study aims to show the comparative efficacy of Lipogems\u00ae as compared to corticosteroid in knee OA patients and to demonstrate its cartilage regeneration potential, which will ultimately deter surgery."

The prevalence of osteoarthritis of the knee has significantly elevated in the elderly population and youth due to age and sport activities respectively. Our aims to treat the knee osteoarthritis are including; reduce knee pain and improve its function; return patients to normal daily activities and reduce health care costs.\n\nThe current treatments which are already being used for osteoarthritis of the knee patients include:\n\nSymptomatic therapy: conservative therapies, physiotherapy, analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\nIntra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid.\nCurrent Surgical Therapy: knee arthroplasty, osteotomy, arthrodesis and debridement.\n\nAs the low mitotic activity and lack of blood supply cause little ability for the articular cartilage to repair itself, so injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has recently received much more attention due to its capacity to do self-healing in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nPRP consists of several concentrated growth factors in platelets of autologous blood that are applied to the different parts of medicine such as reconstruction of damaged tissue. Although platelets are well-known to involve in the blood clots formation, but current studies have shown that they secrete many bio-proteins which attract macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts to remove necrotic tissue in addition to participate in healing procedure.\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to assess The positive effects of platelet-rich plasma injection in 244 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee"

Current treatment has various limitations so that alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, with the ultimate goal of healing damaged articular cartilage are needed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy has shown promising results. However, MSCs are limited by complex regulatory issues. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue through mild mechanical force. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems."

                              "Osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint leading to cartilage damage, pain and loss of function affecting an estimated 250 million people worldwide and 27 million people in the United States . Currently, there are no effective FDA-approved therapies that are disease modifying interventions to prevent the course of joint destruction due to Osteoarthritis The most prevalent first-line treatment for OA is to mitigate pain and restore function with a combination of weight management, physical therapy, mind-body exercises, and analgesia with paracetamol or NSAIDs (topical or oral) . Another prominent treatment strategy is the use of intra-articular corticosteroids (CS) to reduce pain and inflammation via targeting production of interleukins, leukotrienes and prostaglandins However, the palliative effects of CS for OA are often short-term, can potentially lead to chondral fissuring and promotion of dose-independent structural changes in cartilage, and there are no consistent reports of efficacy .\n\nOne novel potential and appealing approach for treating Osteoarthritis is through the local and systemic elimination of senescent cells. Senescent cell burden increases significantly with age and has been shown to promote several age-related pathologies including degenerative joint conditions.\n\nSenescent cells are non-proliferative, resistant to apoptosis, and secrete pro-inflammatory factors that promote disease and systemic aging . Cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals that leads to the production of a collection of various proinflammatorycytokine and other factors that initiate senescence in neighboring cells and promote disease and tissue dysfunction.\n\nThus, senescent cells and their associate senescence associated secretory phenotype profiles likely play a role in both the clinical manifestation of OA (pain) and disease pathogenesis (tissue dysfunction and cartilage degradation. The overall safety and efficacy of several senolytic drugs to treat chronic diseases have been demonstrated in several preclinical studies and more recently in phase I-II clinical trials for OA. For example, the senolytic drug Dasatinib is an FDA approved drug for leukemia with few side effects while other senolytic drugs like quercetin and fisetin are naturally occurring plant flavonoids tolerable at relatively high doses . Clinical trials about the use of senolytic agents as therapeutic agents in different clinical cases:-\n\nSenescent Cell Burden in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Survivors (Mayo Clinic, NCT02652052 )\n\nSenolytic Therapy to Modulate Progression of Alzheimer's Disease ( The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio\n\n,NCT04063124)\n\nSenescence, Frailty, and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Functionality in Chronic Kidney Disease: Effect of Senolytic Agents (Mayo Clinic NCT02848131)\nCOVID-FISETIN: Pilot in SARS-CoV-2 of Fisetin to Alleviate Dysfunction and Inflammation (Mayo Clinic NCT04476953)\nAlleviation by Fisetin of Frailty, Inflammation, and Related Measures in Older Adults ( Mayo Clinic NCT03675724)\nInflammation and Stem Cells in Diabetic and Chronic Kidney Disease ( Mayo Clinic NCT03325322 ) NLRP3 Inflammasome:- Inflammasomes play a crucial role in innate immunity by serving as signaling platforms which deal with a plethora of pathogenic products and cellular products associated with stress and damage. By far, the best studied and most characterized inflammasome is NLRP3 inflammasome, which consists of NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain containing receptor 3) The hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. The search and development of anti- inflammatory drugs from natural sources of plants has received extensive attention.licorice extract has high activity and wide therapeutic effects.it has reported that glycyrrhizin could ameliorate fibrosis and inflammation via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Aim of work:- To determine the efficacy of Natural senolytic agents and NLRP3 Inflammasome inhibitors for reducing knee symptoms and effusion- synovitis in patients wih symptomatic knee Osteoarthritis and knee effusion /synovitis."

                              "Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease that causes joint pain, stiffness, and movement limitation. Nearly 50% in those 75 years and above are affected. In Taiwan, the reported prevalence was more than 6000 per year. The cause of pain is joint instability and structure changed, including hyaline articular cartilage lost, bony remodeling, capsular stretching and periartcular muscle weakness. Current guidelines for treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis include exercise, anti-inflammatory drugs, transcutaneous electrical stimulation(TENS) and magnetic fields(MF) which reduce pain and improve the patient's quality of life.\n\nHowever, conservative therapies and oral supplements have been evaluated but are without clear efficacy. Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. One of the hypotheses is stimulating local healing and current study demonstrated clinical benefit for pain and improvement of function. The effects of multi-point injections were more pronounced in several studies than single-point injection.\n\nExtracorporeal shock wave is common treatment for kidney stones, has been widely used in soft tissue diseases, such as calcified tendon lesions and plantar fasciitis. The theory of extracorporeal shock wave is energy of high-frequency vibration caused destruction of stones and other hard material and by increasing the rate of vascular regeneration in the injured area and increasing the rate of autologous tissue repair, possible biological processes include increased mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation, slowing the inflammatory response and antimicrobial efficacy. Current studies have shown equivalent clinical outcomes on calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy among extracorporeal shock wave therapy, sono-guided acupuncture and arthroscopic surgery and the extracorporeal shock wave has the advantage of non-invasive treatment.\n\nTaking the advantages of non-invasive treatment of extracorporeal shockwave. We want to design a randomized control trial by multi-point shockwave therapy and physical therapy compared with placebo shockwave therapy and physical therapy. Two randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported improvement in outcomes in response to shockwave therapy but were not methodologically rigorous. The investigators therefore conducted a two-arm RCT to assess the hypothesis that adults with symptomatic knee pain receiving shockwave therapy will report greater improvement in knee-related quality-of-life than sham shockwave therapy."

The aims and hypothesis are as follows:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Evaluate the change in pain and functional scores of a single bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in patients with hip osteoarthritis through validated patient reported outcomes scores at baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that triamcinolone and BMAC groups will have pain reduction after each respective intervention. The changes with triamcinolone will be noticeable on the short term. The BMAC changes will take longer to have an effect but will longer duration. The investigators hypothesize that at 6 months and 1 year participants receiving BMAC will have better scores reported on the WOMAC compared to the triamcinolone injection and better than prior to injection.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Evaluate the change of bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in participant's performance on the 6 minute walk test from baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be higher walking distances on the 6 minute walk test in the participants receiving a BMAC injection in comparison to triamcinolone starting at the 3 months follow-up time.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Quantify and correlate cell characterization with patient reported outcomes score.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be better patient reported outcomes in patients who have a higher concentration of mesenchymal stem cells injected.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 50 patients into each arm. Bone marrow will be aspirated then subsequently concentrated using the Emcyte PureBMC kit. The investigators will test the BMAC viability, rapid sterility, endotoxin, platelet concentration, volume, and total nucleated cell counts prior to injecting. The BMAC will be utilized as a hip injection into the affected hip of the patient.\n\nPatients receiving the Triamcinolone will undergo a sham bone needling to simulate the aspiration to keep patients blinded. Both groups will receive their injections under ultrasound guidance."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. This will be done by starting at a low dose of MSCs and moving on to the next higher dose level provided there are no safety concerns. Researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

The discovery of a resident population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within synovial fluid (SF) was the first description of this reparative cell population having direct access to superficial cartilage and joint structures. The ready access of SF MSC to cartilage and other joint tissues offers a novel strategy for joint repair. Current arthroscopic procedures result in the removal of all SF MSCs due to continuous irrigation throughout the procedure. The current study would benefit the patient by greatly increasing the reparative capacity of the joint by bolstering MSC numbers and retaining those MSCs within the joint after surgery. By accessing MSCs from the synovium it is anticipated that these cells would be entrapped/migrate into the marrow clot formed by microfracture of the sub-chondral bone. These MSCs would supplement those from the marrow and may result in faster, better quality repair."

                              "Hemophilia is a constitutional coagulation disorder responsible for a hemorrhagic phenotype in patients from an early age. Hemarthrosis is one of the most frequent complications in hemophiliacs and leads to the development of severe and early arthropathy, sometimes as early as childhood. To date, there is no curative treatment for these joint disorders and preventive treatments are insufficient to completely prevent joint degradation. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to be of therapeutic interest in the management of pathologies such as osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis through their anti-inflammatory, regenerative and anti-apoptotic effects. Hemophilic arthropathy is a separate condition at the border of these two diseases Our study aim to show pre-clinical interest of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in hemophilic arthropathy"

Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires.\n\nMSC obtained from each patient's bone marrow will be isolated and expanded \"Ex-Vivo\" under GMP conditions at Xcelia-Divisi\u00f3n de Terapias avanzadas del Banc de Sang I Teixits. After 21 days, patients will be implanted a single-dose of approximately 40 millions of autologous MSC in the knee by articular injection, and followed up for 12 month. Articular cartilage changes will be determined by T2-weighted MRI (Cartigram) at 6 and 12 month. Clinical assessment will measure the pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS), the self-reported functional status by Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the quality of life by Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) at 3, 6 and 12 month.\n\nThe working hypothesis proposes that the expected regenerative articular cartilage effect of the MSC will be produced to a measurable degree by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires."

This prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial will compare patient-reported outcomes, specifically IKDC scores between patients who receive BMAC post-meniscectomy and those who receive a saline control injection. The study will also compare physical examination, MRI, radiographs, and synovial fluid analysis. Our hypothesis is that those who receive the autologous BMAC injection after the procedure will have better outcomes than those who do not."

                              "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous product prepared from the patient's own blood, representing a powerful source of platelet-derived growth factors, particularly useful in the field of regenerative medicine. The active and sequential secretion of these growth factors induces different cell signaling cascades that activate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, eventually leading to new matrix synthesis and tissue regeneration.\n\nThe potential benefits from the use of PRP for the treatment of cartilage defects rely on a number of studies conducted in validated animal models or in vitro, demonstrating the ability of PRP to stimulate collagen production and proteoglycans synthesis, as well as the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into chondrocytes. Additionally, an increasing number of clinical studies shows an improvement of symptoms, most especially pain, without any occurrence of serious adverse events.\n\nHyaluronic acid (HA), as one of the major components of the synovial fluid surrounding the cartilage, assumes an important role in the viscoelastic properties of the articular cartilage, conferring its shock absorbing and lubricating functions.\n\nIt was demonstrated that rheological properties of synovial fluid decrease with aging and in patients suffering from osteoarthritis. Nowadays, intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid represent a well recommended therapeutic option to relieve osteoarthritic symptoms, conferring a mechanical action on joints structures, thus leading to reduced pain and improved joint function Based on these data, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that a combination of both PRP and hyaluronic acid could provide greater benefits compared to the administration of each product alone, as their effects on osteoarthritis improvement are based on different mechanisms of action. In fact, on one side PRP promotes cartilage regeneration, while on the other side the HA acts as 3-dimensional support mesh for PRP, providing optimal release of platelets growth factors, strengthening and extending in time the activity of PRP.\n\nCellular MatrixTM is a CE-marked class III medical device manufactured by the Swiss company RegenLab SA. Cellular MatrixTM allows to prepare autologous PRP combined with a non-crosslinked hyaluronic acid in a safe, rapid manner and in a single step. The PRP/HA combination is intended to be injected intra-articularly, in order to relieve osteoarthritic symptoms and to improve joint mobility and function. Therefore, the PRP/HA combination might represent a novel therapeutic option for patient suffering from knee osteoarthritis.\n\nThis study will evaluate whether the effects of a PRP/HA combination prepared with Cellular Matrix\u2122, when injected intra-articularly for the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, are superior to those of a well-recognized hyaluronic acid treatment (Ostenil\u00ae Plus), on one hand, and to those of PRP alone, on the other hand."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged as a durable and effective conservative treatment option for OA.\n\nThey are tissue cell-rich concentrates that have demonstrated immunomodulatory activities in several in vitro and in vivo studies, particularly in orthopaedics.\n\nThus, \"minimal handling\" methods for the intraoperative production of tissue cell-rich concentrates has become a widespread strategy in clinical practice. In particular, bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and adipose tissue enriched SVF (at-SVF), i.e. the so-called 'orthobiologics', have proven to be cost-effective and promising sources with a high safety profile and positive short-term clinical results.\n\nDespite growing evidence on the use of orthobiologics, the different methods of preparation and administration and the lack of meaningful data collection do not allow for a clear understanding of the true efficacy of these treatments, resulting in a lack of patient-specific indications.\n\nAlthough the most common method of administering regenerative Although the most common method of administering regenerative medicinal products is by intra-articular injection, more recently it has been shown that in patients with OA the subchondral bone also undergoes significant pathological changes. Given this evidence, intra-osseous (bone-cartilage interface) injections of biological products may represent a promising approach."

The hypothesis is that the patients with hip OA will benefit more and for longer from OA symptoms in the BMAC and PRP group rather than in the group of local anaesthetic and cortisone. Furthermore, this study could be valuable in determining the safety and effectiveness of the BMAC and PRP combined injection for early low grade hip OA in young active patients who are neither good candidates for total hip replacement nor preservative hip surgery."

The investigators will also conduct a statistical regression analysis looking into factors such as time frame from initial injury, the type of injury, gender, and age when injury first occurred. The investigators plan on evaluating clinically and radiographically the effects of the ERIPTO Protocol. There will be two arms of this study. The first arm will be our protocol arm and the second arm will be our BMAC treatment only arm. The investigators plan on collecting objective data on osteoarthritis (OA) severity by taking plain films and assessing the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading scheme in assessing OA severity. The investigators will also administer MRI evaluations for cartilage and meniscal growth prior to treatment and after 1 year. The investigators also plan on collecting subjective symptom scores in the form of knee injury and osteoarthritis outcomes scores (KOOS), visual analog scores (VAS), and international knee documentation criteria (IKDC) score for OA severity. The investigators plan to track changes in both subjective and objective measures of knee OA in our patients through the course of one year."
