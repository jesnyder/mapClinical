Data analysis will be performed separately on the knee osteoarthritis subgroup and on the focal chondral defect subgroup. This will consist of a comparison of mean values for VAS scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months. Clinically significant outcomes will be determined based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) occurring for each respective scale, which is defined as the smallest change score needed for the effect to be considered clinically relevant; described below. Specifically, VAS represents a patient-reported measurement tool used to quantify perceived level of pain, graded on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worse pain possible.",
                              "Functional outcomes will be evaluated clinically and statistically throughout the study period. Data analysis will be performed on the knee osteoarthritis and the focal chondral defect subgroups. Mean values for Knee Injury and Osteoathritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (IKDC), and Lysholm scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months will be compared. KOOS is a qualitative assessment of knee pain, stiffness, function, and quality of life within the last week. The IKDC is a quantitative assessment of knee symptoms with daily and sporting activities with a high score of 100 representing no limitations or pain, with lower scores signifying pain or limitations in knee function. The Lysholm score rates knee pain and symptoms with a high score of 100, with scores > 90 representing excellent function and scores <65 representing poor function.",
                              "T1 rho and T2 mapping observed from MRIs at 1-year and 2-year follow-up to determine the reparative potential of intra-articular MSCs. T1 rho values increase as degenerative changes worsen; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, it is expected that T1 rho values would increase. T2 mapping values primarily reflect changes in water content and collagen anisotropy. Focal areas of increased T2 mapping values correlate with focal areas of cartilage damage; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, T2 mapping values would decrease. Clinically significant changes will be observed by comparing T1 rho and T2 values in areas of relatively preserved hyaline cartilage within our patients with the areas of degenerative change to utilize an internal control. Data analysis will consist of a comparison of mean values for quantitative T1 rho and T2 mapping data pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 12 and 24-months."

Isolated adherent cells will be processed for the ability to differentiate down osteogenic-, adipogenic- and chondrogenic-lineage after cell harvest. Specifically, isolated cells are treated with different media to induce their differentiation into 1) osteo-progenitor cells (identified by positive staining with Alzarian red, 2) adipocytes (identified by positive staining with Oil-Red) and 3) chondrocytes (identified by positive staining with Alcian blue).

The scores are summed for items in each subscale, with possible ranges as follows: pain=0-20, stiffness=0-8, physical function=0-68. A total WOMAC score is created by summing the items for all three subscales. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.
