Metastatic and/or inoperable disease and received prior therapy with docetaxel and candidate to cabazitaxel treatment.\n\nAll patients receive cabazitaxel at standard schedule 25 mg/m2 q21. Blood sample will be collected for CTC evaluation at baseline, after the first cycle of therapy (optional), at first radiological evaluation (after 3 months), at disease progression (optional) or after 9-12 months of treatment for patients who did not show disease progression (optional). Disease progression defined according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria. On blood samples from Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) patients the investigators will investigate the presence of the previously presented CTC, DNA and RNA free markers.\n\nAs an option, it will be possible to require a sample of the tumor collected during prostate surgery or during the biopsy.\n\nAll patients will be treated and monitored according to the local clinical practice. No additional procedures/patient visits in comparison with the usual clinical practice are planned for the study."
