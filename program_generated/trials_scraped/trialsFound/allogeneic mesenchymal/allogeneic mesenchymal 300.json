We hypothesize that the augmentation using HAM (as scaffold) seeded with AAdMSC would further lower the re-tear rates. We plan to record the recurrence of supraspinatus tendon tear (if any) based on radiographic evaluation with ultrasonography, which will then be confirmed with MRI. Ultrasonography provides an excellent anatomical evaluation of soft tissue which is able to assess any alterations during active locomotion. However, due to its user-dependent nature, we will also confirm the findings with MRI examination. Any grade of re-tear (grade I-III as evaluated by ultrasonography and confirmed with MRI) will be counted in and classified as \"re-tear\". When the patients do not complain about any symptoms of re-tear, we will record them as \"no re-tear\"."
