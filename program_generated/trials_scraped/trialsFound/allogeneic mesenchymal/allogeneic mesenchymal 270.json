The Implant Stability Quotient is a linear mapping from resonance frequency measured in kHz to the more clinically useful scale of 1-100 ISQ. The higher the ISQ, the more stable is the implant. The Implant stability is measured every fortnight for three months in 10 patients.The values on test side and control side are plotted on the graph and analysed."

Higher scores indicate better motor function. The primary endpoint in this study was computed from the GMFM-66 score in three steps: 1) The \"observed\" change in motor function from Baseline to Month 12 was calculated (positive values indicate improvement, negative values indicate reduction, and zero indicates no change) for each participant; and 2) The expected change in motor function was determined for each participant based on published growth curves; and 3) The expected change in GMFM-66 was subtracted from the observed change to yield the final primary outcome. Positive values indicate a greater change than would be expected, zero indicates change as expected, and negative values indicate a smaller amount of change than would be expected."
