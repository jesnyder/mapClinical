                              "Randomized, multicentric, prospective, double-blind study: effectiveness of adding allogenic stem cells to a platelet-poor plasma scaffold after arthroscopic debridement and microfractures in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus Osteochondral lesions of the talus (LOC), affects the ankle cartilage, which it seems to have less repair capacity than that of other joints such as the knee of the hip. The LOC can be an important source of pain and affects comparatively younger, working age and athletically active patients.\n\nAlthough there are several therapeutic strategies, debridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically are the most frequent procedures. After this surgery, it is expected that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Though good results have been reported, this fibrocartilage presents histological characteristics of lower quality to those of the native articular cartilage.\n\nBased on previous studies in different joints, it is hypothesized that the augmentation treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal allogeneic stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with debridement and microfractures only.\n\nTherefore, the present study seeks to compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus."

The investigators intend to include 60 patients, who will be randomized to undergo 30 intramuscular injections with either BM-MSC (30 injection sites with 5*10^6 MSCs each) or placebo in the lower leg of the ischemic extremity. Primary outcome i.e. therapy success, a composite outcome considering mortality, limb status, clinical status (Rutherford classification) and changes in pain score, will be assessed at six months."

                              "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory disease (AD), affecting both sexes and all races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monoclonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\n\nAccording to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair mechanisms, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College London for cell manufacturing."

The kind of stem cells we are studying are called allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells or MSCs. MSCs are cells in the body that can grow into different types of cells and respond to various environmental situations. Allogeneic means the cells come from another person (a donor).\n\nThis study is only looking at whether or not it is safe to give the stem cells to adults with CF and how the infusion is tolerated. In the future, other studies may be done to see if stem cells can be a new therapeutic treatment for CF.\n\nStem cells, like other medical products that are intended to treat, cure or prevent disease, generally require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be marketed. The FDA has not approved any stem cell-based products for usual medical care, other than some specific blood forming stem cells for certain indications."

                              "The prevalence of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per 100,000 population. The estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year. Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will develop MSA.\n\nThere are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a means of administering therapeutic agents.\n\nThe subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus clinical criteria for MSA. There will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5 subjects each.\n\nGroup 1 will receives MSC-Adipose Autologous with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally.\n\nGroup 2 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x 50 million cells intratechally.\n\nGroup 3 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally and 2x10cc secretome MSC from Adipose Intravenously.\n\nClinical improvement will be evaluated using the UMSARS scale, PET-Scans, MRI, DaTScan, IGF-1, BDNF, Sympathetic skin respons (SSR), EMG, Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS), High definition-Optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), ERG, VEP, Log MAR chart, Ishihara test and side adverse effect on MSC.\n\nThis study is divided into six timeframes : Before an implantation, First Month after second implantation, Third month after secondary implantation, Sixth month after second implantation, Ninth month after second implantation and Twelve month after second implantation. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to assess clinical improvement within the subjects."

The goals of this study are to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. When isolated from a donor and infused into an animal or human, they have been demonstrated to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease."

                              "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.\n\nIn this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis, ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies."

                              "The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a viral disease that infects the lungs, producing flu-like symptoms. Elderly infected patients and/or those with co-morbidities may suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pneumonia (COVID-19 disease). Given the high transmission, this virus has spread in recent months from Wuhan (China) to the whole world, becoming a global emergency pandemic. The lack of curative treatment for this disease justifies the need to carry out clinical trials that provide quality evidence on treatment options. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, which involves an uncontrolled inflammatory response of alveolar cells, a treatment that attenuates the cytokine cascade could be key in rescuing the patient's lung tissue. Mesenchymal cells, due to their immunoregulatory potential and regenerative capacity, can be an effective treatment for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nIn the present study we propose a therapy with undifferentiated allogeneic mesenchymal cells derived from umbilical cord tissue, a treatment whose safety has already been described in other clinical trials and that shows promising results in pilot studies carried out in China."

The trial is based in our own previous results with autologous MSC (ongoing NCT01183728 trial). We propose here a multicenter, phase I-II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment of osteoarthritis (degrees II and III and IV). The assay consists of two arms with 15 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given an intra-articular transplantation of allogenic MSC, expanded \"Ex Vivo\" with our GMP-compliant procedure (MSV, PEI No. 10-134, authorized by the Competent Authority; same as in NCT01183728). In the control arm a standard treatment with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid shall be given. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability, quality of life and quantitative changes in structure and composition of cartilage determined by T2-weighted MRI relaxation (Cartigram) for one year."

Rectovaginal fistulas cause air, stool, and/or drainage per vagina and may be associated with pain, recurrent urinary tract infections and diminished quality of life. Conventional therapy includes immunosuppressive medications used to treat Crohn's disease and various surgical interventions. However, all have limited ability to heal these fistulas. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat people with rectovaginal fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease."

                              "Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and select patients with Crohn's disease due to overall low patient morbidity and good quality of life. However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with permanent end ileostomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat people who have a peri-pouch fistula related to a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch."

                              "Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response as indicated by the investigator's pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .\n\nObjective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.\n\nStudy design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2."

Here we propose a phase I-II trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment DDD using MSV, a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant expanded bone marrow MSC (MSV, PEI Num. 10-134). The assay consists of two arms with 12 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given a single intra-discal transplantation of MSV (25 millions in 2 ml). Control patients will be infiltrated in the paravertebral muscles close to the lesion with 2 ml of 1% mepivacain. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability and quality of life as well as disc fluid content by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (T2-calibrated)."

                              "Progressive SSc is an entity with limited therapeutic alternatives and with asurvival rate of less than 45% in the first 3 to 5 years. The disease causessevere limitation in quality of life ranging from functional limitation to depression. Up to 20% of patients will be refractory to conventional treatment with diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and cyclophosphamide therapy.This favors the progression to visceral involvement including gastrointestinal,lung and pulmonary hypertension. The latter being a poor prognostic factor,increases mortality in this group of patients and drastically affects their qualityof life. For this reason, different therapeutic options have been considered including cell transplantation and Stem Cell use. Among the options that have been studied so far are stromal mesenchymal cells from Wharton \u0301s jelly. These have been used in intravenous infusion or direct application in different disease scenarios ranging from vascular involvement to interstitial lung involvement and cases of pulmonary hypertension, with promising results in terms of clinical progression,improvement in quality of life and prognostic indices. This therapy has proven to have a significant margin of safety at the time of administration and a low rate of adverse events, a self-limiting fever as the most frequent event. Based on the above and considering the possibility of offering patients without therapeutic alternatives to their disease in addition to palliative options, an intravenous infusion of stromal mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton \u0301s jellyis proposed for three patients with progressive SSc refractory to conventional therapy with pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension.\n\nUnder this premise the question posed in our work is; What are the effects of the infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells from Wharton \u0301s jellyin patients with systemic sclerosis refractory to conventional treatment with Methotrexate or Cyclophosphamide in a population of three patients with severe pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension."

In addition, MSCs inhibit lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting cell division and maintaining these cells in a quiescent state. This supports the hypothesis that MSCs are universal suppressors."

                              "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease of motor neurons. In the early 1980s, Werdnig from Vienna University and Hoffman from Heidelberg University described this disorder. So SMA type 1 was named Werdnig- Hoffman disease. This is the first genetic disorder that cause death after cystic fibrosis in infants with the prevalence of 1 in 6000 birth. Mutation in the SMN1 gene (Survival Motor Neuron) is the reason for the disease that cause decrease in the SMN protein production. So the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord ventricle horn will be destroyed and it cause progressive paralysis and defenite death.No specific therapy is yet available for the treatment of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. Treatment is not disease-modifying and just is supportive. SMA type 1 is diagnosed within the early 6 month after birth and accompanied with breath disorders and definite death in 2 years. The affected infants have a weak muscle tone and they couldn't even hold their head up. Perhaps the only open way for these patients is the application of stem cells that could deliver trophic factor to the apoptotic cells. So this study focuses on the effectivness of cell therapy via adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells on the probable phenotypic changes in these patients."

                              "In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency, drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.\n\nThe study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial, involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24 months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI."

                              "Actively developing stem cells (SCs) transplantation techniques cause natural interest to the problem of regeneration in the lungs. Numerous experimental studies proved the benefits of different types of SCs in experimental models of pulmonary emphysema (PE).\n\nG. Zhen et al. have shown that the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rats with papain-induced emphysema leads to their migration into the lungs, differentiation into type 2 alveolocytes, and inhibition of apoptosis and prevention PE.\n\nK. Schweitzer et al. have proved the activity of inflammation in the airways, alveolocytes and endothelial cells apoptosis decreased after adipose SCs intravenous administration to mice with emphysema caused by chronic exposure to tobacco smoke or VEGF receptors blockade. The study of E.P. Ingenito et al. found that endobronchial installed MSCs engraft into the alveolar wall and peribronchial interstitium and release integrins, extracellular matrix components (collagen IV, laminin and fibrillin), platelet-derived growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor \u03b22.\n\nOur study also found reliable deterrent effect of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs on the development of elastase-induced emphysema in rats at different terms of transplantation.\n\nAfter the success of pilot studies have started clinical trials. Currently, the website http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov reported three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in patients with COPD and emphysema. Two of them have already been completed and the results of the first pilot project published.\n\nAuthors on the example of 4 patients showed a complete absence of adverse effects, improved quality of life and stability of functional parameters at 12 months after starting treatment One of the problems of MSC transplantation in patients with respiratory failure is an accelerated apoptosis of transplanted cells under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Since it is proved that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxia increases their survival in hypoxic conditions, increases the expression of growth factors and antiinflammatory cytokines, we suppose that MSCs grown in hypoxic medium may have a significant positive effect on the disease."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is one kind of stem cell which is gained form adult tissue. Although MSC derived from autogenic bone marrow are proven to help regeneration in non union fracture and long bone defect, the aspiration process through iliac crest is invasive and painful.\n\nTherefore, alternative source of MSC which is less invasive is needed. Adipose and umbilical cord is a \"waste product\" that proven to contain enormous MSC. Furthermore adipose and umbilical cord as an allogenic source is more abundant in number compares to autogenic bone marrow. This enormous source need and adequate preservation technique before applied to the patient. According to that, researchers want to explore the potency of MSC from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose as the source of allogenic MSC and the effect of cryopreservation technique to the viability and quality of MSC. We will also compare the effectivity of MSC implantation from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose applied to non union fracture and long bone defect.\n\nSamples from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose are cultured and the viability of the cells are observed. Some of the cells are implanted directly to the patient with non union fractures and long bone defect while some are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen -190 degree Celsius in three months. All samples are thawed and the viability of the cells are observed. Patient who are implanted by MSC allogenic will undergo clinical and radiological examination in the third, sixth and twenty second month after implantation."

PC is an extremely infiltrative neoplasm that usually presents with vascular and perineural invasion in surgically resected tumors. Metastases to lymph nodes, liver and distant sites are all very common. Its incidence has markedly increased over the past several decades and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Despite the high mortality rate associated with pancreatic cancer, its etiology is poorly understood. PC patients experience physiological symptoms such as anemia, ascites, severe fatigue, pain, cachexia, weakness, insomnia, confusion, and memory loss. The aggressive nature of PC leads to rapid deterioration of patients' quality of life and diminished ability to participate in treatment."

                              "Prevalence of osteoarthritis increases every year, as a chronic and progressive disease. Osteoarthritis also gives many negative impacts in socio-economic life. Current management of osteoarthritis only aimed to relieve pain but not to resolve the degeneration of cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cell is one kind of adult stem cell that has potency in tissue engineering. Sources of mesenchymal stem cell are bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Researchers want to explore the potential of umbilical cord as the source of allogeneic MSC, because the gaining process of MSC is not invasive. Some countries have started some In vitro studies, Animal studies, and human research, but in Indonesia the study of mesenchymal stem cell implantation from umbilical cord in genu osteoarthritis management has not been reported. This study will be held into two years in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and include 9 participants minimally. The researcher also compares the efficacy and safety of MSC implantation from umbilical cord applied to genu osteoarthritis with synovial artificial and recombinant human growth hormone therapy."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in a variety of clinical applications to repair and regenerate damaged tissue. Previous research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of delivering bone marrow cells including MSCs to chronic wounds with significant improvement in healing and scarring. Application of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to severe burn wounds represents an opportunity for improved outcomes where alternate therapies are limited and often ineffective.\n\nIn this protocol, 2nd degree burn wounds will receive direct application of EVs derived from bone marrow MSCs. We have observed success with this type of approach in the past using bone marrow stem cells including MSCs. We have evidence that EVs derived from MSCs are responsible for many of the healing effects produced by MSCs and may be a safer, more reliable alternative to allogeneic cell therapy. This protocol is designed to develop a safe and ideal method of administering bone marrow cell Extracellular Vesicles to wounds."

                              "Now it is commonly accepted that MSC produce an immune-tolerant environment in different settings. It has been shown (mainly for BM-MSC) that MSC can down-regulate T cells activation. This characteristic of BM derived MSC already has clinical implications and shows their potent effectiveness both in prophylaxis and treatment of resistant GvHD. Ongoing clinical trials of use bone marrow MSC for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD are successfully run on and some bone marrow donor registries included BM-MSC as a material for donation. According to our preclinical studies MSC from cells from marrow, placenta, umbilical cord vessels demonstrate similar pronounced immunosuppressive effect both with autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes. Our preliminary clinical experience shows that BM-MSC is an effective tool for treatment of steroid resistant GVHD. Present study aimed to demonstrate if human UC-MSC has in vivo immunosuppressive effect and can be used for GVHD treatment"

The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of UCB HSCT with co-infusion of third party mesenchymal stem cells as assessed by the treatment-related mortality at d100 after transplant.\n\nPatient inclusion criteria:\n\nAge 15-60 yrs Patients for whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the preferred treatment option, with the following hematological malignancies:acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high risk myelodysplastic syndrome, advanced lymphoproliferative disorders, chronic myeloid leukemia (refractory or intolerant to second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors), multiple myeloma Informed consent given Patient exclusion criteria Previous allogeneic transplant Progressive malignant disease Significant organ damage as a contraindication to allotransplantation Significant psychiatric or neurological disorder Uncontrolled viral, fungal or bacterial infection Pregnancy HIV positive Patients will receive either myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning. One or 2 cord blood transplants will be transplanted, followed by infusion of a third-party mesenchymal stem cell transplant Adverse event reporting BHS transplant committee will establish a protocol review committee which will organize a central monitoring of the study. Within the context of allogeneic HSCTx many severe events are likely to occur.\n\nStatistics and stopping rules The trial will be stopped at any time that there is reasonable evidence that the true rate of day +100 nonrelapse mortality exceeds 0.40. It is the intention to include an initial 20 patients."

                              "Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has become a health emergency around the world. Since first patients were detected in Wuhan China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread quickly worldwide, being a severe threat to public health. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing distress are the main characteristics of COVID-19 infection. Some patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure, for which there is no specific therapy. Therefore, safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia is utterly necessary, mainly in critical cases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. These immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the phase I/II, placebo- controlled, randomized MSCs for treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia."

Since dual administration of UCMSC via IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion."

                              "Hemophilia is caused by a single-gene defect resulting in familial bleeding disorder. Small increase in gene products could transform a severe form of hemophilia into a mild one. Stem cells from extrahepatic sources are being considered for clinical applications in liver cell therapy as they possess high in vitro culture potential and could be used in transplant procedures. We studied the differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs) from hemophilia patients' relatives into factor 8 (FVIII)-producing hepatocyte-like cells aiming to expand patients' donor options for partial replacement of mutant liver cells by healthy cells in hemophilia A patients which could manage the severity of the bleeding disorder.\n\nBM-HSCs from hemophilic families will be cultured in short-liquid hepatic induction medium. Appearance of hepatic phenotype will be evaluated by alpha-fetoprotein expression using immunocytochemistry. Functional evaluation of transdifferentiation will be done through detection of albumin synthesis using microalbumin assay kit, factor VIII activity by one-stage clotting assay and expression of FVIII messenger RNA( mRNA) by reverse transcription ( RT-PCR).\n\nInducing the differentiation of BM-HSCs by in-vitro manipulation may become a valuable tool to provide a cell source for hepatocyte transplant procedures for treatment of hemophilia patients."

                              "The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases. Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue (ASCs) have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated their ability to evade recognition and actively suppress the immune system.\n\nThis knowledge is transferred into studies with COVID-19 patients having severe pulmonary dysfunction, to modify the virus induced immunological and inflammatory activity involved in the progression of disease often leading to prolonged ICU stay and in some occasion's death.\n\nWe will conduct a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary symptoms will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic CSCC_ASCs from adipose tissue. The aim is to assess the impact of CSCC_ASCs on the activated immune system and clinical efficacy on pulmonary function.\n\nThe perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be a paradigm shift for the clinical problems and severe outcome seen in some patients with severe COVID-19 and other severe diseases with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome."

Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available. For severe cases, it was found that aberrant pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes are rapidly activated and then producing a large number of cytokines and inducing an inflammatory storm. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells in severe patients with COVID-19."

Pre-clinical sepsis studies suggest that mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells may modulate inflammation, enhance pathogen clearance and tissue repair and reduce death. Our team has completed a Phase I dose escalation and safety clinical trial that evaluated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients with septic shock. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial established that MSCs appear safe and that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is feasible. Based on these data, the investigators have planned a phase II RCT (CISS2) at several Canadian academic centres which will evaluate safety, signals for clinical efficacy, and continue to examine potential mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock."

This group will be compared with the history made in the Postgraduate Endodontics of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) and with international case series made by revascularization.\n\nClinical follow-up of each patient:\n\nClinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of MSC.\nRadiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of MSC.\nA tomographic evaluation will be performed when was evident periapical repair in a periapical radiograph. To measure root formation, root canal narrowing and verification the periapical repair in 3D."

Donor MSCs can serve as a source of recovery for niches in patients with graft failure (GF) after allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation. Since only few MSCs reach the BM after intravenous injection, MSCs were implanted into the iliac spine. Preliminary results suggest that MSCs participate in the restoration of niches for donor hematopoietic cells or have an immunomodulatory effect, preventing repeated rejection of the graft. Perhaps intraosseous implantation of MSCs contributes to the success of the second transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells and patient survival."

It affects the rectum and extends proximally along a variable length of the colon. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition with a relapsing remitting course. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a subset of adult stem cells residing in many tissues, including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues. The purpose of our study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope of allogeneic adipose MSCs in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis."

MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from progression to advanced heart failure."

Participants will be followed up to 90 days after administration for severe adverse events and survival. Safety will be evaluated through adverse event monitoring, clinical evaluations (i.e., vital signs, physical examinations), laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), and cardiac function (i.e., echocardiogram, ECG) from the signing of informed consent and throughout the patient's participation in this treatment protocol."

Participants will be selected as a possible subject because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm discovered on the ultrasound or computed tomographic (\"CT\") scan requested by the participants' doctor.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to collect information that will be used to determine if MSCs can be used to decrease inflammation and possibly slow down enlargement of the participants' aneurysm. The investigators will also be collecting blood samples to study special inflammatory cells that cause aneurysms as well as asking participants to have a \"PET\" (positron emission tomography) scan that can measure inflammation directly in the participants' aneurysm."

Some forms of osteodysplasia may cause severe disability and even death.\n\nEligible patients were limited to those children with Osteodysplasia who had undergone a previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant at St. Jude. The study intervention involved an infusion of a specified number of ex vivo expanded stromal cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same donor from whom they received their primary transplant procedure. These bone marrow stromal cells can become bone-forming cells, called osteoblasts. Participants then received 2 infusions of ex vivo expanded, gene marked cells not less than 6 months after bone marrow transplantation. The second cell infusion occurred between 14 to 21 days after the first infusion in the absence of toxicity. The goal of the study was to evaluate the safety and toxicity of these infusions."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nNon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

Patients in control group are prescribed to current desensitization therapy including at least one of the following treatments: plasmapheresis (PP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab or Bortezomib, depending on individual pathological and immunological features (eg. DSA type and titer) of each study subjects. Patients in MSCs group receive additional BM-MSCs therapy besides desensitization treatments as in control group. Allogeneic BM-MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are intravenously administered every two weeks for four consecutive doses. All cAMR patients are followed up for one year. Renal function, DSA level, pathological features, patient/graft survival, and severe adverse events are monitored during the follow-up period.

                              "Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) which may cause acute life-threatening morbidity or chronic disabilities. Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating GVHD. Therefore, the investigator designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute or chronic GVHD."

Eligible participants were to be enrolled and undergo revascularization of the culprit left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The interventional procedure included as dose ranging assessment of intracoronary (IC) delivery of MPC or placebo infused into the stented coronary artery. This study compared two doses of MPCs and a placebo control group. Study participants were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 fashion to receive either 12.5 Million or 25 Million MPCs or placebo (saline). Initially, each group was designed to have approximately 75 patients per treatment group. The Primary Objective of the study was to determine the safety and feasibility of IC infusion of investigational MPCs in this acute STEMI population.\n\nThe Primary Objective of the study was to determine the safety and feasibility of IC infusion of investigational MPCs in this acute STEMI population. Feasibility of the infusion of the investigational agent was assessed by measurement of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow and perfusion (1) immediately prior to, (2) during (after approximately 50% of total investigational agent volume infused) and (3) following the investigational agent infusion after successful PCI and stenting. There was no evidence of clinically important coronary microvascular obstruction related to infusion of the investigational agent."

The immunosuppressive treatment is gradually tapered starting at the first CB-MSC administration, according to the following scheme: 25% following the first administration, 50% following the second administration, and 100% reduction following the third administration.\n\nAll patients will be followed-up for 6 months from the last CB-MSC. Study visits are planned at baseline during CB-MSC administrations, 2 weeks (follow-up [FU]1) and 6 weeks (FU2) after the last infusion, and then every 6 weeks. During follow-up, the patients undergo a physical examination (including measurement of height, weight and blood pressure) and laboratory evaluations (urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio, complete blood count, kidney function, plasma proteins, liver function, triglycerides and cholesterol). In addition, a blood sample is taken for regulatory T lymphocyte quantification, a marker of clinical response to the infusions."

Today, there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and in more advanced stages the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells found from embryonic mesoderm and found in all tissues. In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. Our approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction."

It has recently been proven that this type of cells are able of transporting oncolytic substances to tumor targets that are difficult to reach, such as medulloblastomas and gliomas, youth cancers located in the cranial cavity that have a poor prognosis and a fatal outcome. In addition, to exerting an anti-tumor action, this virus has the ability to stimulate the immune response, making the therapy even more effective. Thus, the diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and the medulloblastoma in relapse/progression have been chosen to study the potential of this new advanced therapy through a weekly infusion for 8 weeks."

                              "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to have immunosuppressive properties. Following a bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant, a proportion of patients develop a condition called 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD). In this condition the transplanted cells recognize the recipient as foreign and bring about an immune-mediated destruction of tissues. The treatment for this condition is to use drugs that will cause immunosuppression. A small subset of these patients develop a severe form of GVHD (Grade III or IV) which, in spite of the best currently available treatment, is associated with eventual death in more than 90% of cases. The investigators propose to use infusions of expanded MSC from the donor to treat this condition. A few reports on this approach have already been published in peer reviewed journals and preliminary results appear to be promising. The investigators are also aware that larger trials have been initiated to study this. After getting written informed consent, the investigators will infuse expanded MSC into patients who develop steroid-resistant GVHD."

Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently."

Subjects who meet the final inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomized to the test groups (low-dose group and high-dose group) or control group (placebo group) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Subjects assigned to the test groups were administered intravenously once with 5 x 10^7cells of DW-MSC for the low-dose group or 1 x 10^8cells for the high-dose group after registration. Subjects assigned to the control group were administered with placebo in the same manner as the test drug (DW-MSC). At this time, all of the existing standard co-treatment are allowed. DW-MSC is adjunct therapy to standard therapy.\n\nThis clinical trial is a double-blind trial, in which a randomized method will be used. To maintain the double-blindness of the study, statistician who do not participate in this study independently generate randomization code. Subjects will be randomized to the test groups (low-dose group and high-dose group) or the control group (placebo group) in a 1:1:1 ratio. After the completion of the trial, the randomization code will be disclosed after unlocking the database and unblinding procedures.

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment for that. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organs. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. In the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented. We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of healthy volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes, and the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."

So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."

Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of lower extremity amputations in the industrialized world. The lifetime occurence of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) is 20% in diabetic patients.\n\nBetween 15% - 25% of the foot ulcers will lead to lower limb amputations.\n\nIt has been shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) could be an effective therapy for many diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, spinal cord injury, liver injury and critical limb ischemia.\n\nStem cells can be obtained from either the patient (autologous) or non-related healthy donors (allogeneic).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of cultured Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSCs) from allogeneic donors for treatment of chronic leg wounds of diabetic patients."

Liver transplantation might be the most effective therapy for HBV-LF. However, there are a lot of problems such as lack of donors, surgical complications, transplant rejection, and high cost, which could limit the application of liver transplantation. It is demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells could directionally differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in injured liver, as well as reduce inflammation of the liver by immune regulation. In this study, we assess the safety and efficacy of human bone marrow and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for patients with HBV-LF."

Besides routine induction therapy (ATG or Basiliximab) and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs (low-dose Tacrolimus + MPA + prednisone), patients in MSCs group are administered MSCs treatment (1*10^6/kg). Allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are given intravenously at day 0 (post renal reperfusion during surgery), day 7, day 14 and day 21. The renal allograft function, rejection, patient/graft survival and severe adverse events within 12 months post-transplant are monitored."

                              "In this study the investigators propose to perform a Phase II Clinical Trial which seeks to evaluate the safety of cell therapy as a new treatment for patients who suffer from acute non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). If it is successful, a later study to assess efficacy will be performed.\n\nThis disease has an age-adjusted incidence rate of 10/100.000, and in many cases it results in blindness. Currently, there is no available treatment and second eye involvement occurs in approximately 15-25% of the cases.\n\nAll this background originates a particularly dramatic outcome for the patient. Therefore, it seems justified to evaluate new therapies that maintain or improve the visual function in these patients.\n\nThe Project includes a clinical trial whose purpose is the assessment of the safety of intravitreal administration of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with NAION, a product in clinical research phase (PEI No. 15-007) already approved for other human clinical applications (PEI No. 15-007).\n\nIt can be considered that the therapy with intravitreal injection of MSC is a treatment option in patients with acute NAION, since through the paracrine properties of these cells (secretion of neurotrophic, immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic factors) it may prevent or reduce the progression of axonal degeneration caused by this disease."

The novelty of the current UMSC01 treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via IA and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion."

In addition, it has been shown that infusion of third party MSC in HSC transplantation could be successfully used as treatment for grade II-IV steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.\n\nOne hundred and twenty patients with HLA-mismatched donors will be included over 6 years at multiple centers across Belgium through the transplant committee of the Belgian Hematological Society. The conditioning regimen will consist of fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI, followed by the infusion of donor HSC. Patients will be randomized 1/1 in double-blind fashion to receive or not MSC (1.5-.3.0 x106/kg) from third-party (either haploidentical family members or unrelated volunteer) donors on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression will combine tacrolimus and MMF. Except for the collection, expansion and infusion of MSC, the clinical management of the patient will not differ from that of routine NM-HCT."

Remarkable progress has been achieved during last 30 years\uff0cstem cell therapy plays an important role in this progress. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and human cord blood mononuclear cells (hCBMNCs) have been shown to have the ability to modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising therapeutic strategy for burn. In this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCMSCs and hCBMNCs transplantation will be evaluated in patients with acute burn."

Hypogonadism affects about 4 to 5 million men in the US, and the incidence increases with age. In our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is still the only treatment available to cure acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplasia. Allo-HSCT has an anti-tumor effect (called the graft versus leukemia effect= GVL) mediated by donor lymphocytes. This GVL effect is often associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several studies have shown that the relapse incidence is lower in patients developing chronic GVHD. These studies confirm the impact of donor immune system on leukemic residual cells. In fact, the relapse incidence increased in patients with no sign of GVHD. The investigators assume that leukemic cells probably use mechanisms to inhibit the allogeneic response. These escape mechanisms to immunosurveillance have been described in other malignancies. Out of context of the allo-HSCT, in acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasia, correlations between the severity of the disease and the presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or exhausted T cells (PD1 positive) in the bone marrow and in the blood of patients were described at the time of diagnosis or relapse. Myeloid Derived Suppressive Cells (MDSCs) have been described as capable of inducing Tregs and exhausted T cells in the tumor microenvironment.The investigators want to evaluate the role of myeloid suppressive cells in bone marrow after allo HSCT. They hypothesize that their presence in bone marrow and / or blood recipient is correlated to the relapse incidence."

                              "Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or known as Covid-19 has recently become a global health emergency since it was first detected in Wuhan, the People Republic of China in December 2019. Since then, the prevalence has rapidly increased worldwide. In Indonesia, by the end of April 2020, around 10,000 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19 infection, with a case fatality rate of around 8%.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Covid-19 is still under investigation and to our understanding, ACE2 receptors in the alveoli serve as the binding site of the S-protein of envelope spike virus of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 enzyme aids the fusion between cell membrane and capsid of the virus, allowing penetration of virus into the cell. Vesicles containing virion fuse with cell membrane and released as new virions. Cytopathic effect of the virus and its ability to overcome immune response determines the degree of infection.\n\nDifferences in immunological profile among degrees of severity of Covid-19 may vary especially for the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia-inhibiting factors (LIF), immunological markers such as CXCR3+CD4+, CXCR3+CD8+ T cell and CXCR3+ NK cells, implying the ongoing cytokine storm. The previous studies also found increasing number for infection markers such as procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. The decreasing number of anti-inflammatory cytokines in such as IL-10 also supports this finding.\n\nPrevious studies have shown immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory capacity of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs contributed to the shifting of pro-inflammatory Th2 into anti-inflammatory Th2. One of the most recent study on the usage of MSCs on Covid-19 patients showed increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which give rise to inhibitory effect of T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell population. Vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is found increasing following MSCs administration, which indicates the ability to improve the disrupted capillaries due to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The ability of MSCs in differentiating to alveolar cells is proven by the presence of SPM and SPC2, surfactant proteins produced by type II alveolar cells. MSCs are unable to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 since they don't have ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 enzyme."

In the first cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two treatments - low dose SBI-101 or sham control. In the second cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two treatments - high dose SBI-101 or sham control. SBI-101 or sham control will be integrated into the renal replacement circuit and subjects in both cohorts will be treated for up to 24 hours."

Those patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to either the experimental arm or control arm of the study. Those patients randomized to the experimental arm will receive mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) injected directly into the LV endocardium during their LV recruitment or BDG procedure. Those patients randomized to the control arm will receive normal standard of care during their procedure with no injection of MPCs.\n\nIt is believed that injection of MPCs will help improve the chances of those patients with single ventricle or borderline left ventricle being converted to biventricular circulation which could improve quality of life and longevity over palliation."

                              "The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in the Western World, including Denmark. Cancer of the head and neck and its treatment often have a detrimental and lifelong impact on the quality of life of the patients. Radiotherapy is a key component for approximately 80% of all patients with head and neck cancer and despite the enormous improvement in ionizing radiotherapy, the radiation still leads to significant ionizing of healthy tissue, including the radiation-sensitive salivary glands. Salivary glands suffer severe damage from radiation, and as these cells are the principal sites of fluid secretion one of the most prevalent side effect of irradiation for head and neck cancer is hyposalivation and dry mouth syndrome, xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to debilitating oral disorders and major implication for the overall quality of life, including social life and professional life. Currently, only symptomatic treatment is available to patients suffering from xerostomia, and therefore there is an immense, unmet need for new treatment strategies for hyposalivation and xerostomia.\n\nStem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types, and stem cells have been suggested as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of stem cells from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life."

Clinical trials of Umbilical Cord-Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) and Conditioned Medium Umbilical Cord-Mesenchymal Stem Cells (CM UC-MSCs) for Keloid were designed in three groups. Group 1 injected with The UC-MSCs at a dose of 2 million cells / cm3 using a 1 cc injection syringe (27G) by intra-lesion injection and booster with CM UC-MSCs at a dose of 1 cc / cm3 using a 1 cc injection syringe (27G) by intra-lesion injection and booster with CM UC-MSCs at the same dose 3 weeks later. Group 3 injected with Triamcinolon acetonide (TA) at a dose of 40 mg / cc / cm3 using 1 cc (27 G) syringe and booster with TA at 3 weeks later. The study subjects each group amounted to 7 patients suffering from Keloid. Patients were evaluated for 3 months after injection."

                              "Despite being a miracle of modern medicine, solid organ transplant recipients are always at risk of rejection, and remain dependent on lifelong immunosuppression. Currently used immunosuppressive drugs suppress the potential of immune system and interfere with the metabolism of medications. Cellular therapies currently being investigated for this purpose require the use of ablative radiotherapy. The investigators are using a less toxic strategy by harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of the MSCs in the Kidney Transplant (KTx) recipients and studying immunomodulation mediated by these cells in the KTx patients.\n\nHypothesis MSCs interfere with signalling of Immune cells like T cells, B cells and Dendritic cells which leads to improve graft survival of renal transplant patients.\n\nAim To investigate effect of MSCs on immune cell repertoire in a donor specific mediated response.\n\nThe investigators aim to collect peripheral blood from 30 patients (10 patients for autologous cell infusion and 10 for allogeneic (donor derived cell infusion) at various time intervals following MSC therapy. 10 patients serve as controls on standard dose of drugs but without MSC infusion. This peripheral blood would be utilized for isolation of mononuclear cells and performing various immune assays on these cells in a donor specific response."

                              "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and is classified as acute (aGVHD) or chronic (cGVHD). aGVHD onsets within the first 100 days after transplant or with clinical features including erythema, liver dysfunction and oral mucositis, whilst cGVHD or persistent GVHD occurs in approximately 30-60% of transplant patients who survive their first year . Long-term five-year prognosis for cGVHD patients is poor with a 70% mortality rate. cGVHD manifests as an autoimmune-like disease affecting multiple sites, including skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and joints. The oral cavity is the second most common site to be affected with symptoms in 45-83% of cases. In the mouth a diverse spectrum of clinical features can be found for example mucosal lesions can affect almost any site, salivary gland dysfunction and restricted mouth opening. Short-term patients can experience mucosal sensitivity, malnutrition, problems speaking, increased caries risk, xerostomia, oral pain and a diminished quality-of-life. Long-term complications include secondary malignancies and perhaps early death. Clinical management seeks to alleviate the symptoms and improve quality-of-life but 50% of patients fail front-line systemic steroid therapy. Oral cGVHD can be treated with topical high potency corticosteroids and oral rinses, however these treatments are not always effective and carry a risk of systemic absorption. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) resident in adult and fetal tissues, such as the bone marrow have the capacity to form bone, cartilage, stroma, muscle and fat, are known to exhibit immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. MSC infusions have been used to treat disorders such as osteogenic imperfecta, cardiovascular disease and to heal large bony defects. Indeed, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs have led to infusions being used as a second-line treatment for GVHD patients, and our group has shown within a Phase II clinical trial, 55% aGVHD patients who failed front-line steroid treatment responded to MSC infusion these studies are going with cGVHD patients. The goal of this project is to perform a pilot study to determine whether MSC injections directly into mucosal lesions in patients with oral cGVHD are able to alleviate the symptoms and facilitate the reparative process."

Currently approved reperfusion therapies are provided to only a small percentage of patients in the U.S. New therapies are needed that improve outcome and that can be accessed by a majority of patients. Animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered intravenously days after a stroke, safely improve long-term behavioral outcome. A large human experience suggests the safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The current study aims to assess the safety of this therapy in patients with recent ischemic stroke."

                              "Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mediated by stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) which leads to donor T-lymphocytes activation and target tissue destruction, particularly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver in acute setting. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.\n\nObjective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics\u00ae umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.\n\nStudy design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.\n\nFor Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20 patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.\n\nCyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires."

                              "Early reperfusion strategies in tandem with remarkable advances in drugs and devices for treating myocardial infarction (MI) have contributed to a reduction in early mortality, but cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI."

One of the major complications is the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). Thirty to eighty percent of patients after HSCT develop aGVHD despite the prophylactic application of different immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nThe response rates to the conventional first line treatment are only 15-35%4. In case of a steroid refractory aGVHD different therapeutic strategies have been evaluated, but with no satisfactory results so far. The mortality of patients suffering from steroid refractory aGVHD remains at 75-80%. Therefore, it remains important to search for new therapeutical strategies for the treatment of aGVHD."

Potential subjects must be screened and consented before enrolled.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of early intravenous infusion of allogeneic human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs or MSCs used in the following section) for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Eligible patients will receive a single dose of MSCs or placebo within 24 hours after stroke. Patients will be followed for 2 years post infusion for safety and efficacy (change in neurological symptoms and quality of life). Assessments will occur during transplantation and at 3,7, 14 days and1,3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after infusions of stem cells."

                              "Hormones are a chemical substance synthesized and secreted by endocrine gland. Several vital hormones, including Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Estradiol (E2), play crucial roles in regulating female sexual function.- Hormone therapy is used to treat female hormone deficiency and results in a significant improvement, but long-term use increases cardiovascular disease or cancer risk. Other treatments do not give apparent results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and effective treatments to achieve the requirements of improving health in general and sexual health in particularly in women. AD-MSCs have been widely used as autologous and allogeneic stem cell sources to treat numerous disease recently, and they have been proven to be safe. The phase I trial showed that administration of autologous AD-MSCs at the dose of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kg patient bodyweight was safe for patients with sex hormone deficiency. The therapy introduced potential improvement in sexual and general quality of life indicating by the increased FSFI. Therefore, this phase II trial to evaluate efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapy in treatment of female patients with sexual function impairment."

                              "Subjects in this study have had an allogeneic (blood or marrow cells from another person) blood or marrow transplant to treat leukemia, lymphoma or other cancer of the blood, and have now developed Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) that is not responding to standard treatment. GVHD is when the graft (transplanted bone marrow or blood) attacks the recipient's body. GVHD occurs early after transplant (acute) and/or sometimes months after transplant (chronic). Both forms can be life threatening; chronic GVHD can be a lifelong disabling condition.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exist in tissues throughout the body. One place they are found is in the bone marrow and from here they can be obtained by needle aspiration, the same way bone marrow samples are obtained to test for leukemia. This study uses autologous MSCs obtained from the recipient with acute and/or chronic GVHD, which have a lower chance of being rejected. These MSCs may promote tolerance, helping the donor immune cells accept the recipient's body.\n\nThis trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly cultured autologous MSC grown in platelet lysate-containing medium will modulate donor T-cell immune responses and reduce GVHD in allo-HSCT recipients. As a phase I dose escalation trial of autologous MSC in patients with acute and chronic GVHD, the main aim is to evaluate the safety of this therapy and its effects on GVHD biomarkers and T-cell phenotype"

The nature of these cells to immunomodulate both tissue resident and bloodborne immune cells towards a more anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic profile, results in a reduction of tissue-based inflammation within the lung and triggering of repair responses.

The study is a single dose, phase I clinical trial and is the first time that this product will be infused in RA patients. The study duration is approximately fourteen months from time of screening to completion.\n\nResearch hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that when administered therapeutically, MSCs will induce healthy immune responses and will reduce RA disease activity. This study is primarily focused on demonstrating the safety of this approach."

                              "Ischemic heart disease is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in the Western world and is a public health problem. Among ischemic heart diseases, myocardial infarction has specific significance because the cardiac muscle does not have sufficient and adequate capacity to regenerate; therefore, necrosis of a region leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. Infarction can lead to a progressive and irreversible decrease in cardiac function, resulting in heart failure (HF) syndrome, depending on the area affected by this scar, via a ventricular remodeling mechanism.\n\nIn recent years, HF has been revealed as a major public health problem due to its incidence and its social, economic and especially human impact, as it represents a serious limitation of the quality of life of individuals. The prevalence of HF in the general population of the United States and the United Kingdom is approximately 1%, and in those older than 75 years, the prevalence varies between 5 and 10%. Regarding its prognosis, recent data from the Framingham Study indicate that at 5 years, the mortality rate of HF is 75% in men and 62% in women; the mean mortality rate of all cancers is 50%.\n\nThe molecular basis of congestive HF is the absence of cardiac cells capable of regenerating the heart muscle. Despite the publication of recent studies suggesting the existence of stem cells capable of regenerating cardiomyocytes destroyed because of myocardial infarction, in humans, the capacity of these cells is insufficient to replace the cells destroyed due to necrosis secondary to ischemia.\n\nIn recent years, the accumulation of results derived from preclinical studies has allowed the development of the first clinical trials of the feasibility and safety of cardiac regeneration using cellular therapy. Several studies have shown that t cells exist in adult bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and, more recently, multipotent stem cells (MAPC), with the ability to differentiate into endothelial tissue and cardiac muscle, which can contribute to the regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function in animal infarction models. However, cell therapy research has moved rapidly toward the use of more undifferentiated cells rather than hematopoietic lineages, such as mesenchymal cells. These cells can be obtained from different sources, with a tendency toward the use of characterized allogeneic cells, which are immediately available in the potential recipient. Given that this type of therapy has not been rigorously investigated in Latin America, we aim to determine the effect of therapy using Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells (WJ-MSCs) from the human umbilical cord on neomyogenesis in patients with previous myocardial infarction who are undergoing open revascularization. Our hospital has some experience with regenerative therapy, both in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic infarction, with encouraging results that support this new phase of inter-institutional research.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the safety and estimate the effect of coronary revascularization accompanied by intramyocardial injection of WJ-MSCs and the placement of an extracellular matrix patch seeded with WJ-MSCs compared to coronary revascularization accompanied by injection of culture medium without the presence of WJ-MSC and placement of an extracellular matrix patch without seeding with WJ-MSC on global and regional cardiac function, myocardial viability and the incidence of adverse effects determined as ventricular arrhythmias."

                              "Background:\n\n- Sometimes after stem cells are transplanted, donor cells attack the recipient s cells and cause tissue damage. This is called acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Researchers want to see if bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) can help treat GVHD. BMSC can travel in the body and help repair tissue. The BMSC in this study were grown from bone marrow from healthy volunteers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test whether BMSC are safe to use soon after GVHD is diagnosed and to see how the body s immune system responds to BMSC.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- People over 4 years old who had a stem cell transplant at NIH and now have acute GVHD. People who have had certain previous immunosuppressive therapy may be ineligible.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They will have a GVHD exam, including skin and stool tests. They must have a functioning central line.\nParticipation will last 11 weeks: 4 8 weeks of cell infusions, then follow-up for the rest of the weeks.\nUp to 12 cell infusions:\nParticipants will come to the clinic twice weekly.\nThey will get medicine to prevent side effects (like Tylenol and Benadryl).\nBMSC will be given through a small plastic tube in an arm vein or through an IV catheter. It will last 20 60 minutes.\nParticipants will be monitored for 1 hour.\nFollow-up visits: Up to twice a week, participants will have physical exam and blood tests. They may have a GVHD exam.\nParticipants who have a tissue biopsy outside the study will be asked to send a sample to the study."

                              "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the treatment for many malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a serious life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. The outcome for patients with aGVHD is poor and overall survival is low. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as the major complication of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT), limits the application of this curative therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells, which are able to modulate immune response in vitro and in vivo, and have possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as aGVHD. MSCs obtained from umbilical cord (UC) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs. In addition, UC-derived MSCs can be used for off-the-shelf use and are obtained without any harm to donors than bone marrow-MSCs. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs in patients with aGVHD."

                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death from COVID-19. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the violent storm of cytokines and chemokines, which cause uncontrolled fatal systemic inflammation by the immune system on the body, with additional multiple organ failure. Mortality in cases of severe ARDS caused by COVID 19 varies significantly between 50 and 90%, basically depending on the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nThe plasticity of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) regulates inflammation and immunity. MSC can promote and inhibit an immune response, depending on the dynamics of inflammation and depending on the activation force of the immune system, the types of inflammatory cytokines present, and the effects of immunosuppressants. Essentially, the state of inflammation determines the immunoregulatory fate of MSC. Thus, IV application of AMSCa has been shown to control the inflammatory response in various diseases, such as the graft-versus-host reaction and the ARDS caused by H5NI.\n\nThe objective of this study is to describe the clinical changes secondary to IV administration of MSC allogenic, in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, with the evaluation of the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, heart and respiratory rates, and the fever curve.\n\nFive patients, of either sex, over 18 years of age, with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe SIRA that has not improved with the standard management measures used at that time in the care center, will be included in the study. This treatment will be administered after discussing it with the relatives that it is a procedure considered as rescue and will be carried out with informed consent. 1x10(6) xKg will be applied IV.\n\nThe follow-up of the patient will be for three weeks. PaO2 / FiO2 data, fever, inflammatory markers and immunity will be evaluated. The results will be compared with the historical controls attended at INCMNSZ."

                              "Articular cartilage defects in the knee have a poor intrinsic healing capacity and may lead to functional disability and osteoarthritis. Cartilage cell therapy using autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy medicinal product. Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly and extensive two-stage procedure which is limited by the number of chondrocytes obtained by biopsy and the dedifferentiation resulting from the expansion phase. Therefore, there is a need for improvement. A new cartilage repair technique should aim at decreasing surgical trauma, lowering complexity, improving logistics and cost-effectiveness while retaining or improving clinical outcome. Direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes in vitro showed improvement of the chondrogenic phenotype of dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. In addition, preserving the pericellular matrix of chondrocytes improves cartilage formation. These chondrons (chondrocytes with their pericellular matrix) have shown improved cartilage formation when combined with allogeneic MSCs in extensive preclinical studies. The cells are mixed with fibrin cell carrier and applied to the cartilage lesion within one surgical procedure. This will reduce patient morbidity and improve patient care through immediate transplantation of a potent cell-based cartilage product. This is a phase I/II prospective monocenter study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the IMPACT for treatment of focal articular cartilage lesions of the knee."

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501 ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As of April 6th, 2021, an estimated 132.1 million people have contracted the virus and 2,866,000 deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 30.8 million people diagnosed and 556,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation) caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such, therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes hyperinflammation due to \"cytokine storm\" and \"chemokine storm,\" tissue damage, hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.\n\nStage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6 therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3 COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.\n\nRAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are \"reprogrammed\" ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a \"hybrid\" product. The hybrid phenotype inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS."

Transplantation is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity of MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells - chondrocytes. The acquisition of MSC does not require invasive surgical intervention or cartilage extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based strategies.

                              "Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of economy and medical level, the number of cases of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) develops rapidly in China. In 2019, 12,323 cases of HSCT were completed in China, with allo-HSCT accounting for 9600 cases of which.\n\nHowever, Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the most common and serious complications after Allo-HSCT. The incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) is as high as 40%-60% in HLA-matched sibling transplantation, and the incidence is even higher in haplo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(haplo-HSCT) and unrelated donor transplantation. By Glucksberg grading standard, the 5-year survival rates of grade III and IV aGVHD are 25% and 5% respectively, indicating severe GVHD directly affects the survival of Allo-HSCT patients.\n\nThe first-line treatment for aGVHD is still glucocorticoid, while the effective rate is only 30%-50%. Moreover, due to immunosuppression and increasing risk of infection, the efficacy of second-line treatments including polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, immunotoxins, chemotherapy drugs, and light therapy for steroid resistant aGVHD is also poor, with the overall survival rate of 5%-30%.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells, which can promote engraftment and hematopoietic reconstruction by secreting a variety of hematopoietic promoting factors, expressing adhesion molecules supporting hematopoietic stem cells, guiding homing of hematopoietic stem cells and providing hematopoietic microenvironment. At the same time, MSCs can modulate immune responses by affecting the proliferation of T cells and the migration of T cells and DC, inducing the expansion of Treg cells, inhibiting the secretion of antibodies by B lymphocytes, and regulating the secretion of soluble factors such as NO and IDO. As a result of these characteristics and the poor immunogenicity, MSCs are a promising alternative treatment for GVHD.\n\nCurrently, UK and EU guidelines has recommended MSC as a third-line treatment for grade 2-4 acute GVHD, and the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived MSCs in the prevention and treatment of GVHD has also been reported by several transplantation centers in China.However, MSCs have not been used for first-line treatment of aGVHD. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs as the first line treatment in patients with aGVHD."

Although an overall and disease free survival of 85% to 100%, can be obtained in allogeneic blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation using an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor, only about 25% of patients have such a donor.\n\nPURPOSE: In an attempt to avoid GVHD, reduce earlier infection rate and decrease regimen-related toxicity while maintaining better engraftment, this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient's own adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) or AD-MSC transdifferentiated HSC (AD-HSC) transplant after an immunosuppressive regimen in treating patients who have severe aplastic anemia.\n\nThe patient will be in the study for one year for observation and active monitoring. After treatment and active monitoring are over, the patient's medical condition will be followed indefinitely. The principle measures of safety and efficacy will be :\n\nPatient survival probability at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.\nEngraftment at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year\nIncidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and Incidence of earlier infection rate as well as other complications within 6 months and 1 years."

These vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling, and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nThis clinical study will be performed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in healthy volunteers."

The first 10 consecutive patients will receive investigational MSCs manufactured by Duke. In the second phase of the study, 40 additional patients will be randomized to receive placebo or investigational MSCs manufactured by Duke or University of Miami.\n\nPatients will be eligible for infusion of 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC or placebo if they have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS.\n\nResults from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the medical literature. Results from the additional 40 patients will be combined with the first 10 and analyzed. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study."

                              "The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, especially the critically ill cases. The significant clinical outcome and well tolerance was observed by the adoptive transfer of allogenic MSCs. We proposed that the adoptive transfer therapy of MSCs might be an ideal choice to be used. We expect to provide new options for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients and contribute to improving the quality of life of critically ill patients."
