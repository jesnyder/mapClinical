Approximately 26 patients (male and female) ages \u2265 2 and\u2264 45 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome caused by molecular findings consistent with a pathogenic mutation in the gene TCF4. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient's parent or legal guardian/ authorized representative (LAR) prior to participation in the study. The study includes screening, baseline, treatment and safety follow up periods. The procedure for intravenous administration is performed under the supervision of clinician with experience caring for patients with PTHS.\n\nEach patient will remain inpatient for at least 24 hours after the initial dose of AlloRx, for frequent vital sign monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine safety tests, and neurologic assessments. Investigators will work closely with the parent/legal guardian to ensure that any signs of discomfort/distress are immediately communicated to study staff. For the administration of the initial dose of study drug in each study cohort, patients will be dosed in a sequential fashion with no more than one patient receiving their first dose of study drug on the same day.\n\nAn independent data DSMB will review all safety and laboratory data throughout the study on a periodic basis and ad hoc should an SAE occur. The DSMB will also review all available safety data when all patients have received 2 doses of AlloRx and have had at least two weeks of follow-up in order to determine if it is safe to dose the next patient."
