                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death from COVID-19. One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the violent storm of cytokines and chemokines, which cause uncontrolled fatal systemic inflammation by the immune system on the body, with additional multiple organ failure. Mortality in cases of severe ARDS caused by COVID 19 varies significantly between 50 and 90%, basically depending on the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nThe plasticity of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) regulates inflammation and immunity. MSC can promote and inhibit an immune response, depending on the dynamics of inflammation and depending on the activation force of the immune system, the types of inflammatory cytokines present, and the effects of immunosuppressants. Essentially, the state of inflammation determines the immunoregulatory fate of MSC. Thus, IV application of AMSCa has been shown to control the inflammatory response in various diseases, such as the graft-versus-host reaction and the ARDS caused by H5NI.\n\nThe objective of this study is to describe the clinical changes secondary to IV administration of MSC allogenic, in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, with the evaluation of the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, heart and respiratory rates, and the fever curve.\n\nFive patients, of either sex, over 18 years of age, with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and severe SIRA that has not improved with the standard management measures used at that time in the care center, will be included in the study. This treatment will be administered after discussing it with the relatives that it is a procedure considered as rescue and will be carried out with informed consent. 1x10(6) xKg will be applied IV.\n\nThe follow-up of the patient will be for three weeks. PaO2 / FiO2 data, fever, inflammatory markers and immunity will be evaluated. The results will be compared with the historical controls attended at INCMNSZ."

The purpose of phase I study is the feasibility of treating patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 infection (COVID-19) with cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The purpose of the phase II trial is to compare the effect of MSC with standard of care in these patients. MSCs are a type of stem cells that can be taken from umbilical cord blood and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs being used for infusion in this trial are collected from healthy, unrelated donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory. Giving MSC infusions may help control the symptoms of COVID-19 related ARDS."

As both the viral infiltration and infection progress, the host immune system response can be one of a rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm. In the ARDS or NCP ensuing progression, the patient often succumbs to the effects of the hyper pro-inflammatory response, hence contributing to the associated increased mortality as a result of the cytokine storm and associated pathogenesis."

                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) causes the lungs to fail due to the collection of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema). ARDS is common in severely ill patients in Intensive Care Units and is associated with a high mortality and a high morbidity in those who survive. ARDS occurs in approximately 20% case of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. There is a large economic burden with direct healthcare costs, but also indirectly due to the impact on the carer and patient through the patients inability to return to full time employment. There is little evidence for effective drug (pharmacological) treatment for ARDS. There is increasing information that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might be important in treating ARDS. REALIST will investigate if a single infusion of MSCs will help in the treatment of ARDS. The first step will be to first of all determine what dose of MSCs is safe and then divide patients suffering from ARDS into two groups, one of which will get MSCs and the other a harmless dummy (or placebo) infusion, who will then be followed up to determine if lung function improves. If effective this may lead to further research to determine if MSCs are effective in patients with ARDS."

The phase 1 part is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and explore the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of a human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cell product (BX-U001) in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Qualified subjects after the screening will be divided into low, medium, or high dose groups to receive a single intravenous infusion of BX-U001 at the dose of 0.5\u00d710^6, 1.0\u00d710^6, or 1.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg of body weight, respectively. The Phase 2a part is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial examining the safety and biological effects of BX-U001 at the appropriate dose selected from phase 1 for severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the phase 1 part."

Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in management of COVID-19 induced ARDS.\n\nThe primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of MSCs on inflammatory biomarkers."

                              "Whereas the pandemic due do Covid-19 continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients with a 30%-60% mortality rate for those requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. An additional advantage is that they can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. These cells have already been tested in several clinical trials with an excellent safety record.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be cell-treated while the remaining 20 patients will be injected with a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care.\n\nThe feasibility of the project is supported by the expertise of the Meary Cell and Gene Therapy Center, which is approved for the production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and has already successfully prepared the first batches of cells, as well as by the involvement of a cardiac surgery team which will leverage its experience with stem cells for the treatment of heart failure to make it relevant to the Stroma-Cov-2 project."

                              "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the end of 2019 has seen numerous patients experiencing severe acute lung injury (ALI), which developed into severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality was as high as 20% -40%. Due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments, supporting treatment is the predominant therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Its cure is essentially dependent on the patient's immunity. While the immune system eliminates the virus, numerous inflammatory cytokines are produced and a cytokine storm occurs in severe cases.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in injury repair and immune regulation, showing advantageous prospects in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. MSCs prevent cytokine storms by retarding the TNF-\u03b1 pathway, alleviate sepsis by modulating macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, DC cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. After infused, MSCs aggregate in the lungs, improve the lung microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelia, and improve pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary function."

PH is easy to recurrent and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and insufficiency if the disease was poor controlled. Steroid is the most common drug that was administered in acute phase of the disease. However, considered the side-effects, steroid is not suitable for long-time maintenance. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a new therapy. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) are a kind of adult stem cells with high self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation potential in bone marrow. It has become a hot topic in immunosuppressive and tissue repair therapy in recent years. To date, homing, colonization and differentiation of BMSCs in the lung have been observed in animal models of pulmonary hypertension, radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. It had been reported that BMSC transplantation in acute lung injury in mice, inflammation of lung injury can significantly improve. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of BMSC on PH and its mechanism, and to explore a new way to promote the repair of IPH. It is expected to improve the status of IPH therapy in children, especially improve the prognosis of refractory PH."

                              "In December 2019, a sudden public health incident (the corona virus disease [COVID-19] epidemic) occurred in Wuhan, China.\n\nClinical features of those with pneumonia include fever and cough, and in many cases a sudden and accelerating respiratory distress originated from interstitial pneumonia . Many hypotheses have explained hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients, such as hyperimmune reaction to viral infection and cytokine storm that leads to serious lung tissue and alveolar damage or even direct viral insult .\n\nMortality are as high as 15% in critically ill patients requiring intensive care unit admission and oxygen therapy , suggesting an urgent need to try therapeutic interventions in addition to supportive treatment.\n\nThere is more than one type of hemoglobin. In adults, Hb A or Adult hemoglobin which is the main hemoglobin in the blood. But there is another type of hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F, Hb F, or \u03b12\u03b32) is the main oxygen carrier protein in the human fetus. and the levels remain high after birth until the baby is roughly 2-4 months old . Hemoglobin F has a different composition from hemoglobin A and higher affinity to oxygen . At birth, hemoglobin F accounts for 50-95% of the infant's hemoglobin and at around 6 months after birth, hemoglobin A becomes the predominant type.The key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, in Hb A for example). 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F .\n\nA hypothesis for the low incidence of the COVID-19 infection in pediatric is the presence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) .\n\nIn a preliminary study about the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in different countries and the mortality rate of COVID-19, it appears that the mortality is lower in countries with a higher prevalence of hemoglobinopathies .\n\nMice treated with GBT1118 (a compound that enhances the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin) showed a sustained significant increase in SpO2 over 4 h of hypoxia exposure.\n\nPeople with haemoglobinopathies like sickle cell anemia or beta-thalassemia attributed with high amount of fetal hemoglobin, become mostly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms .\n\nThe volume of umbilical cord blood varies from 50 ml to 140 ml with a mean of 85 ml rich in fetal hemoglobin .\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the clinical setting, not only for autoimmune diseases but also for infectious diseases , and their safety and effectiveness have been well elucidated . As a noninvasive treatment, hUC-MSC therapy is a very effective and promising method for clinical application and promotion to treat severe COVID-19\n\nthe investigators offer a solution by increasing fetal hemoglobin by cord blood containing fetal blood transfusion in the critical patients as a trial to combat the course of the disease and minimize the morbidity especially in sever cases who suffer from desaturation until suppression of the immune dysregulation and avoidance of the impending death."

                              "The clinical picture of the novel corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving. Although infections may be mild, up to 25% of all patients admitted to hospital require admission to the intensive care unit, and as many as 40% will progress to develop severe problems breathing due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS often requires mechanical ventilation, with a 50% risk of mortality. Researchers at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) have been studying the potential therapeutic role of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, or MSCs, for the treatment of ARDS for over a decade. This has led to the world's first clinical trial using MSC therapy for patients with severe infections (sepsis) which is often associated with ARDS (NCT02421484). This trial demonstrated tolerability, and potential signs of efficacy. In addition, the investigators have established expertise in producing clinical-grade MSCs and have received approval from Health Canada for the use of MSCs in three different clinical studies.\n\nThis protocol consists of 2 sequential trials using the same trial infrastructure, noted as the Phase 1 trial 'CIRCA-1901' and the Phase 2a trial 'CIRCA-1902'. CIRCA-1901 is an open-label, dose-escalating and safety trial using a 3+3+3 design to determine the safety, and maximum feasible tolerated dose of repeated delivery of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (UC-MSC) intravenously. The investigators will enroll up to 9 patients; each receiving repeated unit doses of UC-MSCs delivered by IV infusion on each of 3 consecutive days (24\u00b14 hours apart) according to the following dose-escalation schedule (3 patients per dose panel): (i) Panel 1: 25 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 75 million MSCs), (ii) Panel 2: 50 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 150 million MSCs), (iii) Panel 3: up to 90 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: up to 270 million MSCs). If no safety issues are identified, we will continue to the Phase 2a trial.\n\nCIRCA-1902 is a single-arm, open-label extension of the CIRCA-1901 trial to assess early signs of efficacy (major morbidity and mortality). The Phase 2a trial (CIRCA-1902) will enroll 12 patients to assess early signals of benefit on mortality and major morbidity in a high risk, high mortality population."

                              "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is considered a public health problem. The World Health Organization estimates that about 210 million people have COPD. Disease-related mortality is more than 3 million, representing 5% of all deaths, 90% of this mortality being concentrated in middle- and low-income countries. COPD can be subdivided into chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Emphysema, the focus of this project, is histologically defined by the permanent increase of the distal air spaces to the terminal bronchioles associated with the destruction of the alveolar septa in the lung. Approximately two-thirds of adult men and a quarter of women (most without dysfunction) will have well-defined emphysema, but often of limited extent.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, microbicide and repair potential. Regarding COPD, several authors have concentrated efforts in the investigation of the relationship between the severity of the condition and the various sources of adult stem cells. Apparently the lungs have a high chemotactic effect in relation to adult stem cells, since several studies have evidenced a high implantation (6-20%) of stem cells derived from bone marrow, administered systemically, in the pulmonary tissue of receptors. Therefore, MSCs has been tested in different lung diseases have no effective treatment, such as pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, COPD positive results, such as reduction of fibrosis, reduction of proliferation inflammatory cells and cytokines, reduction of infectious processes and recovery of the histological changes caused by pulmonary emphysema.\n\nBased on these findings, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic administration of bone marrow stem cells in patients with severe homogeneous emphysema and evaluating the feasibility, efficacy and safety of this procedure."

Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of lower extremity amputations in the industrialized world. The lifetime occurence of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) is 20% in diabetic patients.\n\nBetween 15% - 25% of the foot ulcers will lead to lower limb amputations.\n\nIt has been shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) could be an effective therapy for many diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, spinal cord injury, liver injury and critical limb ischemia.\n\nStem cells can be obtained from either the patient (autologous) or non-related healthy donors (allogeneic).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of cultured Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSCs) from allogeneic donors for treatment of chronic leg wounds of diabetic patients."

                              "Coronavirus is an acute viral disease with prevailing upper respiratory tract infections caused by the RNA-containing virus of the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. Most patients with severe COVID-19 develop pneumonia in the first week of the disease. As the infection progresses, the infiltration increases, and the affected areas increases. Excessive and uncontrolled immune system response with rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm plays the main role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAccording to available data, exosomes can regulate inflammation and regenerative processes due to the change in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and switch the immune cell to regenerative secretome. Inhalation of exosomes may reduce inflammation and damage to the lung tissue and stimulate the regenerative processes.\n\nThis protocol has been developed based on the literature, information about the ongoing tests NCT04276987 (A Pilot Clinical Study on Inhalation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exosomes Treating Severe Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia) and NCT04384445 (Organicell Flow for Patients With COVID-19), Patent No 271036826 of 2019. \"A method for obtaining and concentrating microRNA-containing exosomal multi-potent mesenchymal-stromal cells for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products to stimulate regenerative processes and slow down aging."

                              "Coronavirus is an acute viral disease with prevailing upper respiratory tract infections caused by the RNA-containing virus of the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. Most patients with severe COVID-19 develop pneumonia in the first week of the disease. As the infection progresses, the infiltration increases, and the affected areas increases. Excessive and uncontrolled immune system response with rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm plays the main role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAccording to available data, exosomes can regulate inflammation and regenerative processes due to the change in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and switch the immune cell to regenerative secretome. Inhalation of exosomes may reduce inflammation and damage to the lung tissue and stimulate the regenerative processes.\n\nThis protocol has been developed based on the literature, information about the ongoing tests NCT04276987 (A Pilot Clinical Study on Inhalation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exosomes Treating Severe Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia) and NCT04384445 (Organicell Flow for Patients With COVID-19), Patent No 271036826 of 2019. \"A method for obtaining and concentrating microRNA-containing exosomal multi-potent mesenchymal-stromal cells for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products to stimulate regenerative processes and slow down aging."

                              "The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases. Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue (ASCs) have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated their ability to evade recognition and actively suppress the immune system.\n\nThis knowledge is transferred into studies with COVID-19 patients having severe pulmonary dysfunction, to modify the virus induced immunological and inflammatory activity involved in the progression of disease often leading to prolonged ICU stay and in some occasion's death.\n\nWe will conduct a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary symptoms will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic CSCC_ASCs from adipose tissue. The aim is to assess the impact of CSCC_ASCs on the activated immune system and clinical efficacy on pulmonary function.\n\nThe perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be a paradigm shift for the clinical problems and severe outcome seen in some patients with severe COVID-19 and other severe diseases with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome."

The first 10 consecutive patients will receive investigational MSCs manufactured by Duke. In the second phase of the study, 40 additional patients will be randomized to receive placebo or investigational MSCs manufactured by Duke or University of Miami.\n\nPatients will be eligible for infusion of 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC or placebo if they have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS.\n\nResults from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the medical literature. Results from the additional 40 patients will be combined with the first 10 and analyzed. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study."
