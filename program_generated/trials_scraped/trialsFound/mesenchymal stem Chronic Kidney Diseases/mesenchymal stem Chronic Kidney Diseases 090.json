                              "The chronic kidney disease is caused by renal structural and functional impairment for more than 3 months due to various causes, including normal and abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), abnormal blood, urine, and imaging findings, or an unexplained decline in GFR (<60 ml/min). Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. The incidence of CKD and the primary causative factors vary from country to country and region, and the idemiological survey led by Peking University Hospital shows that the prevalence of CKD in China is 10.8% , the primary causative factor is glomerulonephritis, but as the incidence of hypertension and diabetes rises year by year, and the world will have more than 10 million people a year have acute kidney injury, the proportion of chronic kidney disease in the long-term course of the above population will be much higher than the normal population, chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.\n\nSummarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.\n\nCurrent treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. The presence of the above complications will reduce the service life of the patient's dialysis pathway while also causing blows to other organ systems. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier, and the average survival of transplanted kidneys is currently 12 years calculated by the American National Kidney Foundation, during this period, patients need to take anti-rejection drugs uninterruptedly, and these drugs (such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.) can also greatly damage the kidney organs and function. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease.\n\nProgression in chronic kidney disease includes tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis:\n\n1) Tubular interstitial fibrosis is mainly characterized by tubular hypermetabolism, tubular epithelial-interstitial transition, and hypoxic damage to the renal interstitium, which eventually leads to infiltration of inflammatory cells, abnormal increase in extracellular matrix components in renal tissue, and disappearance of parenchymal cells. 2)Glomerulosclerosis is the outcome of excessive response of glomerular constituent related cells to injury, including structural changes, cells' gradual atrophy, shedding, apoptosis of cells, loss of anticoagulant properties, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pro-fibrosis factors; Proliferation of mesangial cells, mesangial differentiation into myofibroblasts, causing collagen III to be deposited in the renal units, leading to irreversible hardening of the glomeruli; The number of pinus process cells decreases, the skeleton retracts or flattens, and inflammatory cell aggregation of chemokines is released, while synthetic cytokines and growth factors further aggravate globules capillary sclerosis.\n\nBoth pathophysiological abnormalities are characterized by parenchymal cell loss and activation of the inflammatory immune response. However, due to the weak regenerative capacity of renal tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells, foot process cells even lack regenerative ability, these renal parenchymal cells are difficult to repair themselves once damaged, and the kidney lacks stem/progenitor cells, which cannot achieve stem/progenitor cell differentiation and regeneration. Therefore, after severe kidney damage, the existing treatment methods cannot promote the complete repair of the kidneys, often resulting in the delay of kidney disease, which is also the main reason why chronic kidney disease has become the highest incidence of chronic disease in humans.\n\nMSCs are only briefly present in the renal vascular system, and Togel F, Hu Z et al. found that their presence was not detected within the renal parenchyma after 3 days of MSC infusion, and in general, stem cells were only briefly present in the blood vessels of the kidneys and could not colonize for long periods of time7. Studies such as Camila Eleuterio Rodrigues found that gene expression in the kidneys of MSC-treated rats showed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in several growth factors with pro-mitosis, pro-survival, and anti-apoptosis effects8. There is a large body of research evidence that MSCs modulate the immune response primarily through paracrine/endocrine nutritional growth factors and ultimately promote renal repair.1)Stem cells secrete immunomodulatory correlates;2) Stem cell secretion promotes renal vascular formation and tubular cell regeneration related factors;3)MSC may also reduce renal fibrosis and structural remodeling through immunomodulation;4)Stem cell secretion improves matrix metabolism-related factors.\n\nmesenchymal stem cell therapy has a good safety record, there is no obvious toxic side effects for patients, a small number of patients have injection of local discomfort, transient low-grade fever, etc., generally do not need special treatment, patients will recover naturally, long-term observation has not found that patients have increased microbial infections and the carcinogenicity of Mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nCharacteristics and advantages of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs isolated from umbilical cord tissue, not only maintain the biological characteristics of MSCs, but also have the following advantages compared to other tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells: 1) Convenient materials, which is waste utilization. 2) The process is less invasive to the donor than the extraction of bone marrow MSCs. 3) The isolated cell content and proliferation ability are better than bone marrow MSCs, and the immunogenicity is lower than that of bone marrow MSCs, which is not easy to trigger the immune response or cause graft-versus-host disease. 4) The differentiation potential is stronger, and differentiation can be carried out in multiple directions. 5) Stronger ability to secrete cytokines and may have a stronger paracrine (exosome) repair effect. 6) Compared with bone marrow MSCs, the results of gene lineage comparison show that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells can express more genes and proteins related to matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, which is more suitable in the field of nephropathy treatment.\n\nTherefore, in the field of nephropathy treatment, umbilical cord MSC has greater potential for application.\n\nThis study was a prospective, single center, randomized controlled and double-blind study, total duration 36 months, of which each patient study cycle is 13 months, and long-term safety follow-up is 12 months after the end of the study. It is grouped by the random number table method, divided into the experimental group and the control group according to the ratio of 1:1, 22 people were required in the experimental group and 22 people in the control group, for a total of 44 people. Experimental group will receive UC-MSC, while the control group will receive saline solution. The expected effect is UC-MSC can delay the progression of renal function in patients with brady nephropathy,reduced or alleviated chronic kidney disease-related complications (e.g., anemia, hypertension)."

                              "Primary nephrotic syndrome(PNS) is a group of clinical symptoms caused by a variety of factors, including immune,environmental, genetic, et al. Oral corticosteroids have been to be the preferred drug for the treatment of PNS, but the long-term use of glucocorticoid therapy in clinic often induces some problems such as hormone dependent and hormone resistance, as well as severe side effects which act as a threat to the patients' health. On the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in the latest evidence-based practice guidelines, Japan and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes(KDIGO) still have no high-level-evidence recommendation for the steroid resistant PNS and those patients with renal function significantly impaired. In addition, a large number of patients with proteinuria long-term not control often behave faster progression into chronic renal failure, leading to poor prognosis. What's more, patients holding the progression into 3-4 stage of chronic kidney disease with nephrotic syndrome ofen can not tolerate the conventional immunosuppressive therapy, thus cause faster progression into end-stage renal disease. There is no better treatment method for this phenomenon nowadays. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore new treatment options for the clinical disease described above.\n\nIn renal diseases, Rituximab ( RTX) is often used in the treatment of refractory nephropathy, such as hormone dependent nephrotic syndrome, hormone resistance nephrotic syndrome, frequency recurrence nephrotic syndrome, which shows exciting effects in delaying the development of the disease. An observational\u3001 multicenter\u3001 retrospective study about the therapeutic effect of RTX on adult minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) was conducted. This study confirmed that RTX is safe and effective in the treatment of adult patients with MCNS, which can be used as an alternative treatment options for MCNS patients with long-term recurrence. Whereas, whether the rituximab in the treatment of PNS (MCNS or other types of NS) combined with CKD plays the same role on delaying the progression of renal disease, there is no relevant clinical trials reported.\n\nAt present, mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) has been used as a research hotspot to repair the tissue damage of chronic kidney disease, and it also behaves certain effects. Clinical Studies about the treatment of PNS by the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or the treatment of CKD by the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells suggest that the mesenchymal stem cells can improve the patients's condition with PNS or CKD. However, cell therapy in the clinical trials in patients with CKD is rarely to be seen, and there is no definitive conclusion. Accordingly, more clinical studies are needed to assess the effectiveness, feasibility and safety of cell therapy, as well as formulating standard treatment plans.\n\nWe have accumulated 3 cases of patients with chronic kidney disease(in the 3-4 stage), accompanied with a large number of proteinuria and renal function declining rapidly, providing RTX infusion combined with mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nOf which, 3 patients had significantly reduced proteinuria, 2 cases showed different levels improvement of renal function, 1 cases kept stable renal function. There was no obvious adverse reaction and safety risk, but more clinical trials was still required. In addition, our team has carried out a project about autologous non-clearing bone marrow stem cell transplantation in the treatment of severe lupus associated with renal function impaired. This study revealed good treatment effect, which can provide some certain clinical work foundation and experience for our following research.\n\nIn summary, we intend to conduct a prospective\u3001 single-center\u3001 randomized \u3001controlled clinical study, uniting the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University together to explore the effectiveness and safety of rituximab combined with mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of PNS(CKD3-4). The purpose of this study is to seek a more targeted treatment, more precise curative effect and more feasibility treatment for PNS(CKD3-4),so as to delay or reverse the disease and improve the quality of life of patients with CKD."

                              "Introduction:\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disease of alarmingly increasing prevalence (8 - 16%) associated with mortality [1]. CKD can progress towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring renal replacement therapy. ESRD currently accounts for 6.3% of the Medicare spending in the United States, and is projected to increase by 85% by 2015 [2]. In a study conducted among rural population in Bangladesh overall CKD prevalence was found about 19% [3]. Furthermore, ESRD has a major impact on quality of life and life expectancy [4]. Therefore, it is very important to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent, alleviate, or decelerate progression of renal failure.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and hypertension represent major causes of CKD and initiation of dialysis [5]. In addition, glomerular diseases, malnutrition, infectious diseases, and acute kidney injury may lead to ESRD, contributing to the increased global burden of death [6]. Current treatment modalities often fail to target the major underlying contributors for progression of renal disease [7]. Management of CKD at present mostly aims at control of the predisposing factors and supplementation of kidneys homeostatic functions but not at the treatment of the diseased kidney itself. Again due to lack of adequate facilities or financial constraints people of a developing country like Bangladesh are unable to continue long term or lifelong dialysis. Chronic glomerular and tubule-interstitial fibrosis is a common pathway to ESRD, often associated with apoptosis, oxidative damage, fibrosis and microvascular rarefaction. Unfortunately, the regenerative potential of kidney is limited under chronic conditions and inefficient to prevent progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubule-interstitial fibrosis [8]. Treatment strategies that boost cellular regeneration might therefore offer good alternatives for patients with CKD.\n\nStromal vascular fraction (SVF):\n\nSVF of adipose tissue is a rich source of pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), endothelial progenitor cell, T cells, B cells, mast cells as well as adipose tissue macrophages [9,10]. SVF is a component of the lipo-aspirate obtained from liposuction of subcutaneous tissue. Lipo-aspirate contains a large population of stem cells called adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), which share a number of similarities with bone marrow stem cells, including the capacity for multilineage differentiation .\n\nStem Cells:\n\nA stem cell is a generic term referring to any unspecialized cell that is capable of long-term self-renewal through cell division but that can be induced to differentiate into a specialized, functional cell. Stem cells are generally two types, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Adult stem cells can be obtained from many differentiated tissues including bone marrow, bone, fat, and muscle etc. Obtaining adult stem cells also does not raise any ethical concerns [11]. For most studies, the adult stem cell in question is actually a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cell. They are multipotent but not pluripotent, which means they can differentiate into some, or \"multiple,\" but not all tissue types [11]. Stem cells that are harvested from the patient with the intention of administering them back to the same patient are termed autologous MSCs. MSC can also be isolated from the bone marrow (bmMSC), peripheral blood, connective tissue, skeletal muscle, dental pulp (dpMSC), umbilical cord wall (ucMSC), umbilical cord blood (cbMSC), amniotic fluid (afMSC) and all have been used in experimental settings to treat various types of renal diseases. An important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival [12].\n\nAdvantages of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs):\n\nADSCs are somatic stem cell population contained in fat tissue and have been shown to possess stem cell properties such as trans-differentiation and self-renewal [13]. Similar to other types of MSCs, ADSCs express multiple CD marker antigens (CD73+CD90+CD105+ CD34+/- CD11b- CD104b- CD19- CD31- CD45- SMA-) [14,15]. Additionally, utilizing ADSCs is advantageous in that large quantities of stem cells are easily isolated using minimally invasive surgical procedures [16].\n\nADSCs are vascular precursor cells. Many studies have shown that SVF contains progenitor cells that are able to differentiate into endothelial cells and participate in blood vessel formation [17]. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that SVF cells expressing both pericyte and mesenchymal markers reside in a peri-endothelial location and stabilize endothelial networks [17] Another study showed that ADSCs transplanted into an ischemic renal cortex preferentially migrate toward micro vessels where they differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells [18]. Some trials on kidney transplant recipients as well as the one on FSGS and 2 on CKD patients include in their protocol the utilization of adMSC. Adipose tissue is an important source of MSC, with a frequency 100 to 1000 times higher than bmMSC. They also seem to possess a higher potential for angiogenesis or vasculogenesis [19].\n\nKidney disease and mesenchymal stem cells:\n\nA number of different types of cells from the bone marrow have been tested in animals and in clinical studies for potential use in kidney disease. Amongst all the cells under investigation, MSCs have shown the most promising results to date as they help kidney cells to grow, inhibit cell death and encouraging the kidney's own stem cells to repair kidney damage [20].\n\nFew clinical trials have tested safety and efficacy of MSCs for renal disease. Reinders and colleagues studied safety and feasibility in six kidney allograft recipients who received two intravenous infusions of expanded autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs [21]. Importantly, delivery of autologous MSCs was not associated with adverse events, nor did it compromise graft survival. Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the therapeutic potential of autologous and allogeneic MSCs for treatment of renal diseases [22] Administration of both bmMSC and adMSC has demonstrated significant reno-protective effects including reduction of intrarenal inflammatory infiltrate, decreased fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis [12] MSCs possess unique immunomodulatory properties that ameliorate inflammation and immune responses, constituting a promising tool to facilitate renal repair. In recent years, experimental studies have uncovered the potential of MSCs to improve renal function in several models of CKD, and several clinical studies have indicated their safety and efficacy in CKD [22].\n\nADSCs could be incorporated into damaged tissues or organs which could give rise to new functional components and also exert potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, or immunomodulation effects through paracrine or autocrine routes (via vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, stromal-derived factor-1alpha and hepatocyte growth factor) [23,24]. Interestingly, it is proposed that even apoptotic or dying ADSCs exhibit distinctive immunosuppressive properties [25]. ADSCs have been shown to possess stronger anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating functions than bone marrow derived MSCs [26].\n\nVillanueva et al. explored the effect of ADSCs on CKD by a single intravenous infusion of ADSCs on a nephrectomy induced CKD model of rats [27]. ADSC treatment was associated with reduced plasma creatinine, higher levels of epitheliogenic and angiogenic proteins, and improved renal function. Work by Hyun et al [28] illustrated the beneficial effects of ADSCs on improving renal function on a IgAN mouse model. Zhang et al. [30] found that repeated systemic administration of ADSCs attenuated proteinuria, glomerulus hypertrophy, and tubular interstitial injury in a DN rat model [29].\n\nCurrently, several Clinical trials have been uploaded in the NIH database, all aim to test mainly the safety of using MSC and their efficacy in treating CKD. Two of them propose the use of autologous bmMSC and two adMSC. A study conducted in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, which was designed to provide confirmation of Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in CKD. There 18 months safety and efficacy of autologous MSC as a therapy for CKD total of 10 patients were conducted with I/V injection of high dose of 2x106/kg of autologous MSC. Assessments were performed at 1,3,6,12 and 18 months after cell injections [30].\n\nAnother study conducted in Birmingham, Alabama, Rochester, Minnesota, Jackson, Mississippi, USA where stem cell product called \"Mesenchymal stem cell\" grown from person's own fat tissue infused back in to the patient's own kidney and primary outcome measured after 3 months where renal tissue oxygenation increased and decrease in kidney inflammation was seen as secondary outcome [31].\n\nRoute of delivery:\n\nVarious routes for delivery of ADSCs, ADSC-induced cells, or ADSCs combined with compound materials have been developed for the treatment of different diseases or damaged tissue. These routes can be classified into two categories: systemic delivery through blood vessels (intravenous injection or intra-arterial injection) or local delivery directly into injured tissues or organs [32] The route of MSC delivery may influence the cells' capacity to home and engraft the damaged tissue, and thereby their efficacy for renal repair. Commonly used experimental methods to deliver MSCs include systemic intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal delivery. In nonhuman primates the cells distribute broadly into the kidneys, skin, lung, thymus, and liver with estimated levels of engraftment ranging from 0.1 to 2.7% [33].\n\nThe route of MSC delivery, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal, may affect their efficiency for kidney repair. When labeled MSC intravenously infused into baboons were observed for 9-21 months, estimated levels of engraftment in the kidney, lung, liver, thymus, and skin ranged from 0.1-2.7% [34] Indeed, the intravenous route lags in delivery efficiency, because MSC may initially be trapped in the lungs. Intra-arterial infusion of MSC was the most effective route to achieve immunomodulation in rat kidney transplantation, possibly by avoiding lodging in the pulmonary circulation, allowing MSC to home to the injured kidney [35].\n\nAn important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival. By secreting proangiogenic and trophic factors, injected MSCs not only can enhance proliferation, but also can decrease apoptosis of tubular cells [36]. Several routes of administration (intra-parenchymal, sub-capsular, intravenous) have been explored and all seem to be effective. Multiple, repeated injections of MSCs appear to be even more effective than single injections [37,38].\n\nMethodology:\n\nA Prospective study from April 2019 onwards (Approximately Five years or till completion of sample requirements with minimum one year of follow up) will be conducted in Bangladesh LASER & Cell Surgery Institute & Hospital , Dhaka. 31 Patients of CKD who fulfill the selection criteria and admitted at the selected health care facility for treatment will be included in the study. SVF (stromal vascular fraction) will be collected from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Subsequent processing ( Incubation, centrifugation, mixing, washing & neutralization ) will produce final viable & active SVF (ADSCs) cell which will be transfused intravenously. Considering the possibility of further damage of the already damaging or damaged kidney during angiography and placement of catheter into the renal artery, the investigators opt for intra-venous transfusion of the SVF. Before transfusion sample will be collected & cell counting will be done using automated fluorescent cell counter."

Studies include formal measurement of blood and urinary markers of kidney function, BOLD MR and multidetector CT scanning. Forty-two non-diabetic patients between 40 and 80 years of any race or ethnicity will be recruited. All will have hypertension (defined as BP\u2265140/90 mmHg or ongoing antihypertensive drug therapy) but will have less than 180 mmHg to be included (with or without drug therapy). These subjects will be free of cardiovascular events within 3 months and will not have implanted electrical devices, such as a pacemaker or defibrillator. All patients will have identified large vessel renovascular disease (RVD) for Aims 1, 2 and 3. At least 10% of these subjects will be of African-American descent (self-identified) and recruited in collaboration with the University of Mississippi under the direction of Dr. Luis Juncos and the University of Alabama under the direction of Dr. David Calhoun. For completion of Aims 2 and 3, a three-day evaluation will be repeated between three and four months later, and ongoing safety and imaging studies will be performed up to 24 months after MSC administration. Participants in these protocols will undergo transvenous kidney biopsy under the direction of Drs. McKusick and Misra and their colleagues in Interventional Radiology. All subjects for these studies will complete the research plan at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."

                              "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes. It is a persistent and refractory disease. There is currently a lack of effective clinical treatments for DN. The basic pathological processes of DN are renal tissue cell damage, apoptosis and continuous increase of inflammatory cytokines induced by early high glucose, which gradually leads to glomerular sclerosis and renal fibrosis.\n\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), as the \"youngest\" adult stem cells, have powerful anti-inflammatory functions, stronger differentiation potential, and good safety. They are ideal seed cells for the treatment of DN. At present, studies on a variety of animal models of DN have shown that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can delay the progression of DN and have a certain repair effect on damaged kidney tissue and renal function. Our previous preclinical study showed that UC-MSCs effectively improved the renal function, inhibited inflammation and fibrosis, and prevented its progression in a rat model of diabetes-induced chronic renal injury. Some autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been carried out abroad treatment of chronic kidney disease caused by various reasons, including clinical trials of DN, phase I/II test results did not show obvious adverse reactions related to stem cell therapy, and can improve the patient's renal function and quality of life to a certain extent.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating DN patients. This trial will recruit 38 patients. 19 patients received the treatment of conventional treatment + equal volume normal saline containing 1% human albumin (placebo group) were used as control group; conventional treatment + 1*10E6 UC-MSCs/kg body weight (experimental group) for intravenous infusion (once a week, 3 times in total) to treat 19 patients with DN (by unified standard inclusion), and subjects will be followed a total of 48 weeks from time of initial cell treatment."

DKD will be defined as chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m2) in the setting of diabetes mellitus (type 2; on anti-diabetes therapy) without overt etiologies of CKD beyond concomitant hypertension. Progressive DKD will be considered as eGFR 25-55 ml/min/1.73m2 with a) eGFR decline of 5 ml/min over 18 months or 10 ml/min over 3 years or b) an intermediate or high 5-year risk of progression to end-stage kidney failure (dialysis or transplant) based on the validated Tangri 4-variable (age, sex, eGFR, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio) kidney failure risk equation. Fifteen subjects will be placed in one of two cell dosage arms in a parallel design with single-kidney MSC administration at Day 0 and Month 3. Subjects will be followed a total of 15 months from time of initial cell administration."
