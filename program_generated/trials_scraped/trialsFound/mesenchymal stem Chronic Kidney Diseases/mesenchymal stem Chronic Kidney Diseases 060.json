                              "The chronic kidney disease is caused by renal structural and functional impairment for more than 3 months due to various causes, including normal and abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), abnormal blood, urine, and imaging findings, or an unexplained decline in GFR (<60 ml/min). Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.\n\nSummarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.\n\nCurrent treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease."

                              "Primary nephrotic syndrome(PNS) is a group of clinical symptoms caused by a variety of factors, including immune,environmental, genetic, et al. Oral corticosteroids have been to be the preferred drug for the treatment of PNS, but the long-term use of glucocorticoid therapy in clinic often induces some problems such as hormone dependent and hormone resistance, as well as severe side effects which act as a threat to the patients' health. Besides, patients with proteinuria long-term not control often behave faster progression into chronic renal failure, leading to poor prognosis. In renal diseases, Rituximab ( RTX) is often used in the treatment of refractory nephropathy, such as hormone dependent nephrotic syndrome, hormone resistance nephrotic syndrome, frequency recurrence nephrotic syndrome, which shows exciting effects in delaying the development of the disease.At present, mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) has been used as a research hotspot to repair the tissue damage of chronic kidney disease, and it also behaves certain effects. The purpose of this study is to seek a more targeted treatment, more precise curative effect and more feasibility treatment for PNS(CKD3-4),so as to delay or reverse the disease and improve the quality of life of patients with CKD."

                              "Obesity is at risk for the development of chronic kidney disease but the involved mechanisms are not known (Navarro et al. 2015). Establishing the link between obesity and kidney damage is difficult. Indeed, kidney function measurement lacks precision in obese people (Lemoine et al. 2014) and requires expensive methods such as measurement of 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Biopsies are too invasive for the detection of emerging kidney damage or for the following of the kidney function. Therefore new tools are required for the early identification of at risk individuals for the kidney damage complication.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells may represent such a relevant tool. These cells are present in a large number of organs, including kidney (Costa et al. 2020).\n\nIn addition to be differentiated cells progenitors (Dominici et al. 2006), they also support immunosuppressive, anti-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic functions that have been used for the treatment of kidney fibrosis (Usunier et al. 2014). Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells contribute to tissue homeostasis and their alterations may reflect organ dysfunctions. Indeed, mesenchymal stem cells from obese adipose tissue lose their immunosuppressive (Serena et al. 2016) and differentiation (Gustafson et al. 2009) functions and contribute to fibrosis (Keophiphath et al. 2009) and inflammation (Lee et al. 2010; Gustafson, Nerstedt, et Smith 2019). It is thus probable that kidney dysfunctions are associated with functional alterations of kidney mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nThe collection of mesenchymal stem cells from kidney can easily be performed from urine and next cultivated for amplification. They are called urine stem cells (USC).\n\nFrom our experience with obese mouse adipose stem cells, we observed that functional changes of stem cells preceded adipose tissue dysfunctions. Functional signatures of mesenchymal stem cells are thus representative of changes occuring in the function of the tissue notably in answer to obesity. These features could be used to identify obese people presenting ongoing alterations of kidney function, before clinical manifestations of kidney dysfunction. Because kidney mesenchymal stem cells are easy to isolate from urine, their collection is compatible with the follow up of patients and can be applied to a large number of individuals, including the younger. USC could represent a valuable tool to detect progression towards kidney damage.\n\nIn this project we plan to analyse USC alterations induced by obesity and to identify signatures associated with the progression towards kidney damage and type 2 diabetes. The goal is to evaluate USC as potential marker for the non invasive monitoring of patients in answer to a need that is not achieved by the present available approaches."

                              "Osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint leading to cartilage damage, pain and loss of function affecting an estimated 250 million people worldwide and 27 million people in the United States . Currently, there are no effective FDA-approved therapies that are disease modifying interventions to prevent the course of joint destruction due to Osteoarthritis The most prevalent first-line treatment for OA is to mitigate pain and restore function with a combination of weight management, physical therapy, mind-body exercises, and analgesia with paracetamol or NSAIDs (topical or oral) . Another prominent treatment strategy is the use of intra-articular corticosteroids (CS) to reduce pain and inflammation via targeting production of interleukins, leukotrienes and prostaglandins However, the palliative effects of CS for OA are often short-term, can potentially lead to chondral fissuring and promotion of dose-independent structural changes in cartilage, and there are no consistent reports of efficacy .\n\nOne novel potential and appealing approach for treating Osteoarthritis is through the local and systemic elimination of senescent cells. Senescent cell burden increases significantly with age and has been shown to promote several age-related pathologies including degenerative joint conditions.\n\nSenescent cells are non-proliferative, resistant to apoptosis, and secrete pro-inflammatory factors that promote disease and systemic aging . Cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals that leads to the production of a collection of various proinflammatorycytokine and other factors that initiate senescence in neighboring cells and promote disease and tissue dysfunction.\n\nThus, senescent cells and their associate senescence associated secretory phenotype profiles likely play a role in both the clinical manifestation of OA (pain) and disease pathogenesis (tissue dysfunction and cartilage degradation. The overall safety and efficacy of several senolytic drugs to treat chronic diseases have been demonstrated in several preclinical studies and more recently in phase I-II clinical trials for OA. For example, the senolytic drug Dasatinib is an FDA approved drug for leukemia with few side effects while other senolytic drugs like quercetin and fisetin are naturally occurring plant flavonoids tolerable at relatively high doses . Clinical trials about the use of senolytic agents as therapeutic agents in different clinical cases:-\n\nSenescent Cell Burden in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Survivors (Mayo Clinic, NCT02652052 )\n\nSenolytic Therapy to Modulate Progression of Alzheimer's Disease ( The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio\n\n,NCT04063124)\n\nSenescence, Frailty, and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Functionality in Chronic Kidney Disease: Effect of Senolytic Agents (Mayo Clinic NCT02848131)\nCOVID-FISETIN: Pilot in SARS-CoV-2 of Fisetin to Alleviate Dysfunction and Inflammation (Mayo Clinic NCT04476953)\nAlleviation by Fisetin of Frailty, Inflammation, and Related Measures in Older Adults ( Mayo Clinic NCT03675724)\nInflammation and Stem Cells in Diabetic and Chronic Kidney Disease ( Mayo Clinic NCT03325322 ) NLRP3 Inflammasome:- Inflammasomes play a crucial role in innate immunity by serving as signaling platforms which deal with a plethora of pathogenic products and cellular products associated with stress and damage. By far, the best studied and most characterized inflammasome is NLRP3 inflammasome, which consists of NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain containing receptor 3) The hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. The search and development of anti- inflammatory drugs from natural sources of plants has received extensive attention.licorice extract has high activity and wide therapeutic effects.it has reported that glycyrrhizin could ameliorate fibrosis and inflammation via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Aim of work:- To determine the efficacy of Natural senolytic agents and NLRP3 Inflammasome inhibitors for reducing knee symptoms and effusion- synovitis in patients wih symptomatic knee Osteoarthritis and knee effusion /synovitis."
