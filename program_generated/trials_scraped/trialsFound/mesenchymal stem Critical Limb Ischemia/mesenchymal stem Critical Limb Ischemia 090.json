                              "When the long blood vessels supplying blood to the arms and legs become blocked (ischemic), patient will experience painful sensations in their calves when they walked which slowly become excruciating painful at rest. When the condition worsens, the patients will not be able to feel any pain from their legs and they will not know if there are any small ulcers or cuts on their legs. As a result, a small ulcer which goes unnoticed becomes bigger and can sometimes become infected. In the worst situations, infection might lead towards gangrene and septicaemia. Severe rest pain and/or ulcerations of ischemic limbs are defined as the state of chronic critical limb ischemia and at this point, amputation of the affected limb is suggested.\n\nConventional treatments include angioplasty/bypass operation to remove blood vessel blockage to restore blood supply, the use of prescribed medicines to aid in ulcer recovery and clear infection and debridement of damaged/infected tissue. Some procedures have to be performed multiple times. Amputation is inevitable in many cases because some blood capillaries cannot be corrected and restenosis of vessels is very common. Cell therapy with mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow is promising because these stem cells are capable of stimulating and regenerating capillaries and blood vessels."

                              "A prospective, multicenter, open, randomized, parallel-group controlled study for two levels of dose.\n\nThe study population will consist of 30 non-diabetic patients with critical chronic ischemia in at least one of the lower limbs (CLI) and without possibility of revascularization, from whom results can clinically be evaluable, of whom, 20 patients will be included in the experimental group (10 for each dose level) and 10 in the control group.\n\nIn each of the two dose levels to be used in the study, 15 patients will be included, who will be randomized to the experimental group or the control group according to a distribution 2:1 (2 patients in the experimental group and 1 in control group), thus at each dose level, we will have 10 patients in the experimental group (treated with mesenchymal cells of adipose tissue) and 5 patients in the control group (conventional treatment, including the use of prostaglandins per protocol).\n\nPatients who are randomized to experimental treatment Group with CeTMAd may receive one of the following dose levels:\n\n0.5x106 cells / kg of patient weight\n1x106 cells / kg of patient weight\n\nThe recruitment will be done with escalating doses, starting at the lower dose. To switch to the higher dose will require a favorable opinion of the Ethics Committee of the H. Universitario Virgen Macarena to evaluate the clinical status of patients and therapeutic safety and study procedures.\n\nPatients who are randomized to the treatment control group will continue with conventional treatment which they were performing at the time of inclusion in the study (including the use of prostaglandins as protocol).\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of regenerative treatment with mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (CeTMAd), administered intraarterial in nondiabetic patients with chronic critical ischemia of at least one lower limb without possibilities of revascularization or alternative therapies. We will analyze the complications from regenerative therapy and / or study procedures.\n\nMain objectives:\n\nSecurity: It will be studied the possible complications due to the procedure in the first 24 hours of administration of CeTMAd, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.\nEfficiency: It will be studied the generation of new vessels (vasculogenesis) and enhancement of collateral circulation (angiogenesis / arteriogenesis).\nSecondary objectives:\n\nIt will be studied the evolution of ankle brachial index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, degree of Rutherford-Becker, ulcer size, calf perimeter, the score of pain and intermittent claudication (walking test).\n\nDuration of the clinical trial: From the infusion to the patient of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Adipose Tissue to the end of the monitoring, there will be 12 months."

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

                              "Ischemic limb disease remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world despite the development of several new therapeutic modalities. Based on experimental data demonstrating that infusion or injection of stem/progenitor cells enhances blood flow in models of cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials were initiated in 2001 to treat patients with critical limb ischemia or cardiac ischemia with circulating blood or bone marrow-derived cells. Despite all promises, pending uncertainties and practical limitations attenuate the therapeutic use of stem/progenitor cells for ischemic limb disease. The main theme and method in the current program project, based on expertise, track record, and preliminary results of PI's laboratory, is to focus on clinical studies of using allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), expanded under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), in treating ischemic limbs. This project is an integrated and coordinated effort aimed to overcome the regulation of cell product, and the barriers of preclinical and clinical studies. For the purposes, we have specially set up the core laboratory for stem/progenitor cells production and quality control in Cell Therapy Clean Room on the 9th floor of Medical Science Technology Building in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We have also completed the preclinical studies in using allogenic hypoxic mouse MSCs in treating limb ischemia. In the current project, bone marrow MSCs will be isolated from allogenic donors, expanded under hypoxic conditions using medium containing no serum or animal-derived reagents, and applies for Phase \u2160/\u2161 study in treating 18 recipients with ischemic limb diseases in three years."

                              "Lower limbs arteries are a frequent localization of atheroma in elderly people (15-20% after 70 years). The most severe stage of the disease, critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined clinically by the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer, has a dramatic prognosis at 12 months, with 30% of the patients alive with an amputation, 20% mortality and only 20% of patients with a resolved disease, independently from the treatment. The only validated treatment for this disease is revascularization by endovascular procedures or open surgery. Patients with no option or poor option (high risk) for revascularization have the worst prognosis.\n\nCurrent research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide revascularization and oxygenation of the tissues. A specific form of stem cells, called Adipose-derived Stem/Stroma Cells (ASC), has shown promise for recovering from ischemic disease like critical limb ischemia (CLI) in preclinical trial and trial in phase I. This study will confirm the efficacy autologous transplantation of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal cells in patients with critical limb ischemia with poor options or no option for revascularization.\n\nThis study is a phase II, prospective, multicentric, open trial and no comparative.

                              "The ADIPOCLI trial is an interventional monocentric trial in which the investigators will evaluate the safety, feasibility and potential efficacy of local administration of autologous adipose derived stromal/stem (ASCs) cell as treatment for pain and ulcers caused by CLI. If the results confirm safety, feasibility and show potential beneficial effects of the intervention regarding clinical parameters, a larger clinical research with longer follow up will be initiated focusing on efficacy. The objective of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of ASCs inoculation in peri-tibial area, though reducing pain significantly in patients with CLI not eligible for revascularization.\n\nAutologous fat grafting is widely used for soft-tissue augmentation and replacement in reconstructive and aesthetic surgery providing a biocompatible, natural and inexpensive method. Noteworthy, recent reports have identified adipose tissue as the tissue in the body that contains the highest percentage of adult stem cells. These adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) can undergo multilineage differentiation and may be crucial for the surgery purpose of healing ulcers as they have potent regenerative effects on endothelium and immunomodulatory properties.\n\nAdipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are considered to be an attractive alternative to pluripotent cells with characteristics similar to BMMSCs. Compared with these latter cells, ASCs offer several advantages, including ease of isolation, less donor morbidity, relative abundance, and rapidity of expansion. Preliminary attempts with ASC cell therapy have been made to induce healing of ulcers developed in peripheral vascular diseases of some animal models and human disorders.\n\nThe benefits of peritibial inoculation of autologous adipose tissue are the reduction of ischemic pain, the improvement of skin and muscle perfusion, the suspension of major amputation interventions and the healing of trophic lesions if present.\n\nThe result of the intervention varies from individual to individual and depends on the engraftment of the transplanted material. In some cases the pain completely disappears. In others, the transplanted material may undergo varying degrees of reabsorption (from 50% to 70%) and therefore a new transplant may be necessary after some time (6-12 months).\n\nThe risks are linked to local complications of the procedure such as edema, ecchymosis, pain in the district of surgical aggression (the extent of these three manifestations varies from patient to patient, but are generally modest), dehiscence, bleeding of the wound, site infection surgical.\n\nThe study has a total duration of 24 months. The recruitment phase lasts 18 months. After the surgical procedure, the patient will be followed for 6 months, during which he will undergo outpatient visits at 7 and 21 days; then at 1, 3, and 6 months. At each visit, the patient will be assessed for the amount of pain and the transcutaneous oximetry value. As in the usual clinical practice and in the diagnostic-therapeutic path of the arteriopathic patient, instrumental examinations (measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index - ABI, arterial ultrasound Doppler lower limbs) are performed at the enrollment, at the twenty-first day and 6 months after the procedure .\n\nThe investigators will include 20 patients with CLI who satisfy the inclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to select patients with CLI, not suitable for revascularization and who are in reasonable health condition to allow trial participation. Study participants are recruited from our own outpatient population or emergency room. Baseline characteristics are collected during the first visit and include medical examination, ABI and TcPO2 evaluation and Doppler ultrasonography to study the arterial axis of the limb. If CLI is diagnosed, the patient is hospitalized and undergoes an angiography study. Quality of Lyfe test is administered at hospitalization and at follow up.\n\nAfter angiogram, treatment of choice will be selected during the multidisciplinary vascular conference taking the individual condition of patients into account. Patients eligible for revascularization are submitted to open/endovascular surgery. Patient with CLI unsuitable for revascularization continue hospitalization being given best medical therapy, i.e. pain-killer drugs and prostanoids. Only to these class of patients an adjunctive treatment with local fat grafting is proposed. Information sheet is given to every patient after interview with investigators and informed consent is taken before the procedure."

                              "Diabetic foot (DF) is a concomitant illness of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is one of the main causes of non-traumatic amputation worldwide due to severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease with chronic critical limb ischemia being the most abundant problem. Ulceration occurs as failure of oxygenation, nutrient supply and progressive occlusion of larger blood vessels often exacerbates pre-existing microvascular abnormalities.\n\nPurified bone marrow mononuclear cells or expanded bone marrow cells enriched in Cluster of Differentiation 90+ (CD90+) mesenchymal stem cells (named tissue repair cells, [TRCs]) are used in the treatment of diabetic ulcers in comparison to bone marrow derived stem cells to induce revascularization of the affected limb and to enhance local perfusion. Cells are administered intramuscular or intraarterial. A control group of patients treated according national guidelines without stem cells serves as comparator.\n\nDiabetic foot patients with chronic limb ischemia and without the option for surgical or interventional revascularization were recruited and randomized to the transplant groups or the control group within this clinical trial. To measure the therapeutic effects of the various treatment arms patients were evaluated for (ankle brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TcPO2), and reactive hyperemia (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD]). Patients also underwent imaging with angiographic methods."
