                              "Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing. The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.\n\nIn addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.\n\nMSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19 Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective.\n\nThe current Phase I/II study of adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal stem cells is conducted with the broad objective of establishing safety and efficacy."

                              "Critical Limb Ischaemia (CLI) is a condition characterized by chronic ischemic at-rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene for more than 2 weeks in one or both legs, attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease.CLI is associated with a high risk of lower amputation, diminished quality of life and mortality. Revascularization by either bypass surgery or endovascular recanalization is considered the first-choice treatment in patients with CLI.\n\nRevascularization is not always possible because patients with CLI often have severe comorbidities or because it is not technically feasible.\n\nOn the basis of their well-recognized regenerative and angiogenetic properties, cell therapy with autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) has been proposed and tested in different animal models and in some human pathological conditions characterized by peripheral ischemia and wound formation."

The investigators intend to include 60 patients, who will be randomized to undergo 30 intramuscular injections with either BM-MSC (30 injection sites with 5*10^6 MSCs each) or placebo in the lower leg of the ischemic extremity. Primary outcome i.e. therapy success, a composite outcome considering mortality, limb status, clinical status (Rutherford classification) and changes in pain score, will be assessed at six months."
