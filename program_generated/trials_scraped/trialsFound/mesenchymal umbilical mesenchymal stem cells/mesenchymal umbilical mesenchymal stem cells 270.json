The ASIA assessment is the gold standard for assessing SCI. The exam is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body. Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0-5 according to the adjacent table, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0-2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. Each side of the body is graded independently. The ISNCSCI exam is used for determining the neurological level of injury. ASIA Impairment Scale for classifying spinal cord injury includes five grades: A, B, C, D and E."

Each performance item is rated on this scale with a given number of points from 0 to 10 or 0 to 15. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 100.
