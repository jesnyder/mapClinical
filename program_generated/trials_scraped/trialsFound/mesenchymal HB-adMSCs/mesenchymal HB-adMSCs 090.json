                              "This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. 24 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD. The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the ability of HB-adMSCs to alter AD-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and markers associated with amyloid deposition, Amyloid beta 40 and Amyloid beta 42. Subjects will also be assessed for cognitive deficits measured by changes from baseline values using Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), Altoida Neuro Motor Index (NMI) for Digital Biomarkers, and Clinical Dementia Rating Questionnaire (CDR)."

Once these assessments have been performed and the results of laboratory tests have been obtained, the principal investigator must evaluate whether the screened patient is eligible to participate in the expanded access program. If a participant meets the eligibility requirements for participation in the expanded access program, infusion number 1 (the baseline visit) must be scheduled.\n\nInfusions Every patient who qualifies for participation in the expanded access program will be invited to receive autologous HB-adMSCs infusions. The administration of investigational products will take place at the Hope Biosciences Stem Cell Research Foundation, where the delegated personnel will closely monitor patients' vital signs.\n\nFollowing the Sponsor Standard Operating Procedures, Hope Biosciences autologous adipose- derived mesenchymal stem cells should be mixed and administered to each eligible patient. HB-adMSCs should only be administered intravenously and a vital sign monitoring of two hours post-drug exposure. Monitoring intervals of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.\n\nAdditional to the administration of the investigational product, the delegated personnel should complete the following assessments.\n\nCollection of vital signs, as well as updates on medical history and concomitant medications if needed.\nWeight measurement.\nCollection of laboratory samples at INF 1 and INF 5. (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood Count& Coagulation Tests).\nPhysical examination.\nParkinson's disease assessments.

Immediately following the completion of each infusion, the patient should be assessed to ensure that the post-infusion discharge criteria have been met.\n\nFollow Up A follow-up will be conducted during this visit. Delegated personnel will communicate with the patient to determine whether any adverse events or serious adverse events have occurred since the last visit. Also, during this visit, updates on medical history and concomitant medications must be recorded in the patient's chart if needed.\nEnd of Expanded Access Program\n\nPatients will be assessed by delegated personnel on the last visit of the expanded access program, which will take place at week 26. The following assessments will be performed:\n\nCollection of vital signs, as well as updates on medical history and concomitant medications if needed.\nWeight measurement.\nCollection of laboratory samples.

HB-adMSCs should only be administered intravenously, with vital sign monitoring of two hours.\nAssess the incidence of any adverse event.\n\nTwenty-four hours after administration of the investigational product, study participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by telephone call to assess the incidence of adverse events.\n\nInfusion 2 through Infusion 13.\n\nThe following assessments are necessary during these visits:\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\n\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator.

HB-adMSCs should only be administered intravenously, with vital sign monitoring of two hours.\nAssess the incidence of any adverse event.\n\nTwenty-four hours after administration of the investigational product, study participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by telephone call to assess the incidence of adverse events. The child's skin and eyes will be checked for symptoms of yellowing at each visit, and caregivers will be asked whether they have seen any vomiting, nausea, or the subject looking to be more tired than usual. Discharge instructions will include monitoring for these symptoms. Liver enzymes will be assessed at Screening, Infusion 2, 4, 7, 10, and End of Study per-protocol; however, these laboratory samples can be collected more often if the principal investigator indicates.\n\nSafety Follow Up\n\nThe following evaluations will need to be completed during this visit:\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\n\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator.\n\n-End of Study Visit\n\nUpdate medical history and concomitant medications if any change occurred since the last visit.\nMeasure vital signs, including respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and weight measurement.\nCollect laboratory samples, including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), Complete Blood Count (CBC), Inflammatory Markers, and Coagulation panel.\nPhysical examination by Principal Investigator.\nCHOP INTEND, PDMS-2 & PEDI-CAT by delegated personnel."
