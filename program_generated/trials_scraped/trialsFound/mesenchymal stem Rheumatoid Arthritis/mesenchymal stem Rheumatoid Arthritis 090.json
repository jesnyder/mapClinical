After signing informed consent form, autologous stem cells were obtained by bone marrow aspiration. Isolation and culture (3 to 4 weeks in MEM-alpha medium) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were performed in accredited good manufacturing practices (GMP) clean room. A panel of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers including CD105, CD166, CD44, CD45, CD90, and CD34 were checked for making sure about differentiation of cells into MSCs after 3-4 weeks of cell culture. Viability of MSCs was checked by Trypan blue testing and all of the cultivations were negative for bacterial contamination. A single dose of 1000000 to 2000000 mesenchymal stem cells/kg infused into patients intravenously. To prevent anaphylactic reactions, a single intravenous dose of hydrocortison (100 ml) and oral dimenhydrinate (10 ml) were administered before MSCs infusion into patients. The effects of mesenchymal stem cells on the cellular and humoral immune responses and also the role of chemokines in homing of immune cells were studied at time points 1, 6 and 12 months after intravenous administration of MSCs in refractory rheumatoid arthritis."

                              "This is a prospective, multicenter (with two performance sites under the auspices of Case Western Reserve University Clinical and Translational Science Award (CWRU CTSA) at University Hospitals and at MetroHealth Medical Center), double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infusion in 20 new onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients with moderate to high disease activity despite adequate doses of methotrexate (MTX) for 12 weeks (at least 10 weeks of which has been at a dose of >/=15 mg per week). The study is a single dose, phase I clinical trial, and this is the first time that this product will be infused in RA patients. After a screening period, the baseline visit will be conducted. Patients will halt their concomitant MTX 3 days prior to the MSC infusion and may resume their methotrexate at Day 7 following MSC infusion based on their disease activity score. This is a dose escalation study of a total of 20 patients with three groups of five patients each and five placebo patients. Patients will be randomized to receive MSC or placebo infusion using a computer-generated randomization scheme that takes into account that there are two sites. The first cohort will consist of a total of six patients. Of these six patients, five patients each will receive a single infusion of 2 million/kg MSCs and one patient will receive placebo infusion. The second cohort will include a total of seven patients, of these seven patients; five patients will receive 4 million/kg MSCs and two patients who will receive placebo infusion. The final cohort consists of a total of seven patients. Of these seven patients, five patients will receive 6 million/kg allogeneic MSCs and two patients will receive placebo infusion. Infusion will occur on Day 0. Post-infusion study visits will occur on Days 1 (Visit 3), 7 (Visit 4), 14 (Visit 5), 28 (Visit 6), 56 (Visit 7), and weeks 24 (Visit 8), 39 (Visit 9) and 52 (Visit 10). Phone calls will occur on Day 4, 21, and 72. Subject safety and tolerability of the single dose of MSCs will be evaluated at these study visits by reviewing interval histories, administering patient questionnaires (legacy [Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID 3) / Short Form 36 (SF36)] and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive technology CAT), performing physical exams and spirometry, and obtaining safety laboratories. Special attention will be given to exacerbation of RA or \"flare\". This study will also explore the efficacy measures: Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) and American College of Rheumatology20/50/70 (ACR20/50/70 will be calculated. Since the primary hypothesis is that infusion of MSCs will induce a state of immune tolerance, various assays to detect post-infusion changes in cells subsets, function or protein biomarker will be repeated at Day 7 and/or 14 and compared to baseline values (with-in subject comparison). Biomarkers to look at cell-subsets will be drawn. Selected patient samples will be stored for exploratory studies using Mass Cytometry (Cytof 2). Lastly, for those subjects who are agreeable to undergo the procedure, a bone marrow aspiration will be performed prior to infusion with allogeneic MSCs. MSCs from RA bone marrow will be expanded, banked, and used for future translational studies."

Pain and stiffness often worsen after rest. Most frequently, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. RA affects between 0.5-1% of adults in the developed world with between 5-50 per 100,000 people newly developing the disease each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning and quality of life.\n\nHerein, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the immunomodulatory effects of bone marrow-derived stem cells administered intravenously and the regenerative and repair potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells transplanted into the joints of patients with RA."

                              "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive cholestatic disease associated with the development of cirrhosis and liver failure that may justify liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only drug approved specifically for the treatment of PBC. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into biliary epithelial cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in PBC patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus UDCA. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus UDCA. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 4,8,12,24,36 and 48. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase(ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time(PT), albumin(ALB), prealbumin(PA), are detected at these time points. Mayo risk score, portal hypertension, Liver histology, MELD score and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune-mediated necroinflammatory disease of the liver characterized by elevation of IgG, presence of characteristic autoantibodies, and histological feature of interface hepatitis. Standard therapy consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which is efficacious in 80% of patients. However, current treatment strategies are complicated by frequent relapse after drug withdrawal, medication intolerance, and refractory disease. Alternative medical therapy may be need for AIH.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in AIH patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus conventional treatment (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus conventional treatment. (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), \u03b3-globulin, total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA) and IgG, are detected at these time points. MELD score, Liver histology, treatment side effects, relapse rate and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Traditionally, RA has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and non-biologics-DMARDs. Only non-biologics-DMARDs and, at a lesser extent, glucocorticoids have shown to be able to prevent or interrupt the inflammatory and destructive disease processes.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic stromal cells that are able to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, and adipose. MSCs can be easily isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue and rapidly expanded in culture. MSCs have also been shown to have immuno-suppressive and healing capacities, improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties could be used for novel therapeutic applications in various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), genetic bone and cartilage disorders and bone metastasis. MSCs can potently modulate immune responses, showing antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory capacities.\n\nThis study is a multicenter phase Ib/IIa, escalating dose, single blind clinical trial to assess the safety of the intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) to refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerance, and to identify, if possible, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose for future clinical trials on efficacy of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs for patients suffering rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under treatment with at least one non-biologic-Disease modifying antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) who have previously failed to treatment with at least two biologics. The secondary objective is to obtain information on the clinical and functional effects of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs in patients with RA and to explore pharmacodynamics parameters.\n\n53 patients (i.e. patients having received at least one dose of study treatment) in three different cohorts are planned to be included in this clinical trial. Expansion will start after acute toxicity assessment of the first three patients of each cohort.\n\nDose and intervals for the trial consist of the following active groups: a) first cohort: 1 million cells/kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; b) second cohort: 2 million cells / kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; c) third cohort: 4 million cells / kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15."
