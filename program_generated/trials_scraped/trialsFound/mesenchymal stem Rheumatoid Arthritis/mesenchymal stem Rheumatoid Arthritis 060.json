Rheumatoid arthritis will eventually result in the destruction of cartilage, bone and ligaments and joint deformity. The underlying hypothesis is that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSCs) has anti-inflammatory effects and thus potentially alleviates the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. The study is to explore the safety and efficacy of UC-MSCs transplantation in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

Arthritis rheumatoid is an autoimmune disease which causes multi articular arthritis, such as knee osteoarthritis. As the disease progresses the cartilage become frustrated, surrounding bone react to become thicker and inflammation occurs in subchondral bone seen in T2-weighted MRI as increase in signal density. Patients are treated initially by pain management. In patients who don't response to first line treatment invasive treatment like total knee replacement is done. The investigators designed this clinical study with the aim of evaluating therapeutic effects of intra-articular injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in 60 patients with knee osteoarthritis."

Rheumatoid arthritis ultimately results in the destruction of cartilage, bone and ligaments and joint deformity. The underlying hypothesis is that autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal and specific populations of stem cells has anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects and thus potentially alleviates the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. The study is to explore the safety and efficacy of BM-SC transplantation in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

                              "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease that causes substantial loss of intrahepatic bile ducts, ultimately resulting in cholestasis, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Histologically, the disease is characterized by chronic portal inflammation with infiltration, destruction and loss of the epithelial cells in the small-sized and medium-sized bile ducts. Currently, Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13-15mg/kg/day is recommended as therapeutic drugs for PBC by AASLD and is approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with UDCA may delay disease progression and prolong survival free of liver transplantation. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both. UC-MSC has been application for the treatment of several severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for PBC patients will be evaluated."

                              "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the liver, interface hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and the presence of autoantibodies. Disease presentation is varied but typically is based on characteristic aminotransferase elevations, histological abnormalities, elevated levels of serum globulins, and the presence of one or more autoantibodies. Two types of juvenile AIH have been identified according to seropositivity for smooth muscle and /or antinuclear antibody (AIH type 1) or liver kidney microsomal antibody (AIH type 2). Standard therapy in clinic consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which displays the efficacy in 80% of patients. However, 7% of patients deteriorate despite compliance with the standard corticosteroid regiments (treatment failure),13% of patients improve but not to a degree that satisfies remission criteria (incomplete response), 13% of patients develop serious drug-induced complications, and 50%-86% of patients will relapse after drug withdrawal. These serious drawbacks counterbalance the benefits of conventional therapy, and they are compelling reasons to refine current treatment strategies and pursue alternative therapies. UC-MSC has been the application for the treatment of several severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for AIH patients will be evaluated."
