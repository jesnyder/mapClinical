The goals of this study are to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. When isolated from a donor and infused into an animal or human, they have been demonstrated to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease."

MSCs will be prepared accordingly to established protocols, starting from bone marrow explants of living-donor kidney transplant recipients obtained 3-4 months before kidney transplant. From these samples, MSCs will be expanded in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) approved facilities and used for the present study in patients undergoing kidney transplantation."

The investigators intend to include 60 patients, who will be randomized to undergo 30 intramuscular injections with either BM-MSC (30 injection sites with 5*10^6 MSCs each) or placebo in the lower leg of the ischemic extremity. Primary outcome i.e. therapy success, a composite outcome considering mortality, limb status, clinical status (Rutherford classification) and changes in pain score, will be assessed at six months."

Remarkably, in all reported clinical studies the toxicity of Mesenchymal stromal cells administration has been found consistently negligible. The investigators believe that Umbilical Cord (UC) derived Mesenchymal stromal cells may represent a stronger immunosuppressive tool for such clinical emergency and no data suggest any change in the safety profile of these cells. For this reason, and in the best interest of the patient, the investigators plan to test the safety and activity of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal stromal cells when given sequentially to another partially effective treatment of steroid resistant acute graf versus host disease such as Pentostatin."

However, there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients receive induction therapy and immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) infusion compared to saline-only infusion in reducing the immune suppression necessary to achieve optimal renal function in renal transplant recipients. All participants will receive routine care: basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids."

As a common therapeutic line of action is not shared for steroid resistant GVHD, it is important to establish the toxicity and the feasibility of preparation and infusion of third party MSCs for acute steroid resistant GVHD and acute phases of chronic steroid resistant GVHD.\n\nA total of 10 patients (pediatric and adults) need to be enrolled in the study. Patients who present clinical signs of either acute or chronic steroid resistant GVHD will receive by intravenous infusion at least two fixed doses of mesenchymal stem cells with 5 to 7 days of interval one from the other, derived from HLA unrelated donor different from the HSC donor (third party donor) regardless of the rate of HLA mismatch.\n\nPrimary objectives are to establish the feasibility and the toxicity of preparation and infusions of third party MSCs for the treatment of steroid resistant acute and acute phases of chronic grade II-IV GVHD.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\nTo document the efficacy of MSC infusion in steroid resistant acute and acute phases of chronic GVHD grade II-IV.\nTo document the rate of GVHD recurrence in MSCs infused patients.\nTo document relapse of hematological malignancies post MSC infusions in patients undergoing MSCs treatment for steroid refractory GvHD.\nTo document the overall survival of MSC infused patients for steroid refractory GvHD."

Patients with viral-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) will be eligible. Ten patients will be enrolled and receive allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC). Ventilator parameters as well as preoperative clinical characteristics and postoperative clinical outcomes will be registered. Routine blood sampling, radiography, and bronchioalveolar lavage will be performed pre- and postoperatively. Spirometry, quality of life assessment, and 6 minute walk test will be performed postoperatively. All available data will be collected prospectively. Follow-up is 12 months. Informed consent will be obtained from relatives to patients meeting the inclusion criteria before the initiation of any study-specific procedures."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exhibit immunomodulatory properties and a recent pilot study suggests a response rate of 70% in steroid- refractory patients. In the present randomized study the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment will be further studied in patients with cGvHD."

Up to ten percent will develop late severe gastrointestinal complications (i.e. Pelvic Radiation Disease - PRD). Symptoms are proctopathy (5-20%) and radiation-induced cystitis (3,5%) that affect quality of life. The treatment of PRD is limited to managing the symptoms; new alternatives should be proposed.\n\nClinical trials using MSCs to treat hemorrhagic cystitis, proctopathy have demonstrated the feasibility to used MSCs in these pathologies :\n\nMSCs successfully repair hemorrhagic cystitis, and perforated colon in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis, perforated colon and peritonitis.\nSix clinical trials are currently ongoing for proctopathy, 3 are phase III. Results suggest an inhibition of chronic inflammation and fistulization and interruption of hemorrhagic syndromes.\nClinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of MSCs to treat hemorrhagic cystitis is in progress.\nA decrease in pain after the injection of MSCs was observed in patients treated by radiotherapy for breast cancer, radiation burns, and radiotherapy over-dosage.\nFour patients, were treated with MSCs after receiving overdose pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer. A decrease in pain (EN score), bleeding and diarrhea was observed.\n\nMSCs will represent a promising alternative strategy in the treatment of severe enteritis, rectitis and cystitis after radiotherapy, and may avoid surgical treatment and may diminish the adverse effect of PRD in terms of chronicity, morbidity, mortality and health costs."

Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be easily isolated and culture expanded from bone marrow aspirates and provide an excellent source of progenitor cells for cell-based regeneration strategies due to their ex vivo differentiation and proliferation capacity. Although there are hints that MSCs derived from OA patients may exhibit altered function the role of MSCs with respect to disease development and progression of OA is not clearly understood to date. To assess whether advanced-stage OA affects MSCs' suitability for musculoskeletal regenerative therapy, in the present study, we compare proliferation and differentiation potential of MSCs from osteoarthritic versus healthy donors."

We will also describe the symptom course and duration of this hyper-inflammatory syndrome in these patients. Six patients less than 21 years old with MIS-C that is refractory to intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and/or steroids will be given intravenous infusions of hCT-MSCs. Doses of 2x10^6 cells/kg (up to a maximum dose of 100x10^6 cells) will be given on days 1, 2, 3, +/-7 (day 7 is optional). Participants will be followed up to 90 days after administration for severe adverse events and survival. Safety will be evaluated through adverse event monitoring, clinical evaluations (i.e., vital signs, physical examinations), laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), and cardiac function (i.e., echocardiogram, ECG) from the signing of informed consent and throughout the patient's participation in this treatment protocol."

Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient."

Preclinical research shows that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to the progression of BPD and thus present as a promising new treatment option. The main purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs in extremely preterm infants at risk of developing BPD."

The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in OA-preclinical models has been associated with a reduction in cartilage degradation, the attenuation of bone sclerosis and an effective anti-inflammatory response. Investigators have designed a randomized phase I/II placebo controlled trial of UC-MSCs in knee OA. Outcomes will be evaluated at 12 months, comparing monodosis versus double intra-articular injection, re-randomized at 6 months."

                              "The main purpose of this project is to cure patients with high risk Sickle cell disease and other red cell disorders including thalassemia and diamond-blackfan anemia by bone marrow transplantation. The patients enrolled in this study will be those who lack matched sibling donors and therefore have no other option but to undergo bone marrow transplantation using matched but unrelated bone marrow or umbilical cord blood from the national marrow donor program registry. Since bone marrow transplantation for these disorders using matched unrelated donors has two major problems i.e. engraftment, or , the process of new marrow being accepted and allowed to grow in the the patient; and graft-versus-host disease, or the process where the new marrow \"rejects\" the host or the patient, this study has been devised with methods to overcome these two problems and thus make transplantation from unrelated donors both successful in terms of engraftment and safe in terms of side effects, both acute and long term.\n\nIn order to accomplish these two goals, two important things will be done. Firstly, patients will get three medicines which are considered reduced intensity because they are not known to cause the serious organ damage seen with conventional chemotherapy. These medicines, however, do cause intense immune suppression so these can cause increased infections. Secondly, in addition to transplantation of bone marrow from unrelated donors, patients will also transplanted with mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow of their parents. Mesenchymal stromal cells are adult stem cells that are normally found in the bone marrow and are thought to create the right background for the blood cells to grow. They have been shown in many animal and human studies to improve engraftment. In addition, they have a special property by which they prevent and are now even considered to treat graft versus host disease. Therefore, by using a reduced intensity chemotherapy regimen before transplant and transplanting mesenchymal stromal cells, we hope to improve engraftment while at the same time decrease the potential for severe side effects associated with a conventional transplant which uses extremely high doses of chemotherapy."

Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available. For severe cases, it was found that aberrant pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes are rapidly activated and then producing a large number of cytokines and inducing an inflammatory storm. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells in severe patients with COVID-19."

                              "Formal study hypothesis:\n\nCranial reconstruction using mesenchymal stromal cells and resorbable biomaterials, will result in the patient producing their own bone to fill the void which will reduce the risk of infection and resorption, lead to a better cosmetic result and obviate any long term consequence of having a synthetic material in vivo.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThere are several reasons that parts of the skull may need to be removed:\n\nAfter trauma to relieve brain swelling\nDuring brain surgery (for brain cancer)\nAfter trauma where the bone is so badly fractured/fragmented it needs to be removed.\n\nIn all but the last case the bone flap is temporarily stored in a freezer and once the brain swelling has subsided it is reinserted. This procedure is called \"autologous cranioplasty\"; autologous, because it originally came from the patient and cranioplasty, referring to the repair. Although this is a straightforward procedure, there are a number of complications including infection and bone resorption that can occur.\n\nThis study:\n\nStromal cells have a proven ability to aid in bony healing. Furthermore stromal cells on a ceramic framework encased in a plastic scaffold have been shown in a small clinical trial to lead to healing of skull defects. In the present study, it is proposed to add stromal cells from a suitable donor to medical grade ceramic granules, place them in between specially moulded plastic scaffolds and insert the sandwich into the skull. Both the ceramic and plastic materials are medical grade and commonly used in reconstructive surgery, the ceramic for packing into bony defects due to trauma or removal of cancer and the polymer in bony reconstruction. Both materials are approved by the TGA. They are designed to dissolve away over time as the body's own blood vessels and cells populate the sandwich and create the patient's new bone. It has been proven that without the encouragement of the cells and temporary scaffold materials, a hole in the skull will not heal. Given the incidence of bone resorption/infection and metal plate infection using traditional methods, it would seem prudent to provide a construct that will allow controlled replacement with the patient's own bone, thus negating any adverse long-term complications with synthetic materials that remain for life."

                              "Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has become a health emergency around the world. Since first patients were detected in Wuhan China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread quickly worldwide, being a severe threat to public health. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing distress are the main characteristics of COVID-19 infection. Some patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure, for which there is no specific therapy. Therefore, safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia is utterly necessary, mainly in critical cases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. These immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the phase I/II, placebo- controlled, randomized MSCs for treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia."

                              "Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response as indicated by the investigator's pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .\n\nObjective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.\n\nStudy design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2."

                              "Septic shock remains a significant clinical problem associated with high rates of mortality among neutropenic patient despite antimicrobial therapy and supportive care. Recently, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated remarkable potential effect in sepsis. MSC treatment significantly reduced mortality in septic mice receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy. MSCs reduced systemic inflammatory cytokine levels in mice, down-regulated of inflammation and inflammation-related genes (such as interleukin-10, interleukin-6). Bacterial clearance was greater in MSC-treated mice. Thus, MSCs have beneficial effects on experimental sepsis and suggest that MS\u0421s-therapy may be an effective adjunctive treatment to reduce sepsis-related mortality.\n\nThe safety of MSCs is proved by Graft-versus-host disease treatment MSCs in patients after bone marrow transplantation.\n\nThis study hypothesis is that MSCs reduce organ dysfunction/injury, systemic inflammation and mortality in patients with septic shock and severe neutropenia.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to evaluate the impact of MSCs therapy on organ dysfunction/injury, systemic inflammation and 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and severe neutropenia. All patients will be randomized in two groups: control group (standard treatment of septic shock) and MSCs-group (standard treatment of septic shock + MSCs infusion of 1-2 millions/kg/ day)."

                              "Subjects in this study have had an allogeneic (blood or marrow cells from another person) blood or marrow transplant to treat leukemia, lymphoma or other cancer of the blood, and have now developed Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) that is not responding to standard treatment. GVHD is when the graft (transplanted bone marrow or blood) attacks the recipient's body. GVHD occurs early after transplant (acute) and/or sometimes months after transplant (chronic). Both forms can be life threatening; chronic GVHD can be a lifelong disabling condition.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exist in tissues throughout the body. One place they are found is in the bone marrow and from here they can be obtained by needle aspiration, the same way bone marrow samples are obtained to test for leukemia. This study uses autologous MSCs obtained from the recipient with acute and/or chronic GVHD, which have a lower chance of being rejected. These MSCs may promote tolerance, helping the donor immune cells accept the recipient's body.\n\nThis trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly cultured autologous MSC grown in platelet lysate-containing medium will modulate donor T-cell immune responses and reduce GVHD in allo-HSCT recipients. As a phase I dose escalation trial of autologous MSC in patients with acute and chronic GVHD, the main aim is to evaluate the safety of this therapy and its effects on GVHD biomarkers and T-cell phenotype"

The immunosuppressive treatment is gradually tapered starting at the first CB-MSC administration, according to the following scheme: 25% following the first administration, 50% following the second administration, and 100% reduction following the third administration.\n\nAll patients will be followed-up for 6 months from the last CB-MSC. Study visits are planned at baseline during CB-MSC administrations, 2 weeks (follow-up [FU]1) and 6 weeks (FU2) after the last infusion, and then every 6 weeks. During follow-up, the patients undergo a physical examination (including measurement of height, weight and blood pressure) and laboratory evaluations (urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio, complete blood count, kidney function, plasma proteins, liver function, triglycerides and cholesterol).

                              "Whereas the pandemic due do Covid-19 continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients with a 30%-60% mortality rate for those requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. An additional advantage is that they can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. These cells have already been tested in several clinical trials with an excellent safety record.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be cell-treated while the remaining 20 patients will be injected with a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care.\n\nThe feasibility of the project is supported by the expertise of the Meary Cell and Gene Therapy Center, which is approved for the production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and has already successfully prepared the first batches of cells, as well as by the involvement of a cardiac surgery team which will leverage its experience with stem cells for the treatment of heart failure to make it relevant to the Stroma-Cov-2 project."

                              "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and is classified as acute (aGVHD) or chronic (cGVHD). aGVHD onsets within the first 100 days after transplant or with clinical features including erythema, liver dysfunction and oral mucositis, whilst cGVHD or persistent GVHD occurs in approximately 30-60% of transplant patients who survive their first year . Long-term five-year prognosis for cGVHD patients is poor with a 70% mortality rate. cGVHD manifests as an autoimmune-like disease affecting multiple sites, including skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and joints. The oral cavity is the second most common site to be affected with symptoms in 45-83% of cases. In the mouth a diverse spectrum of clinical features can be found for example mucosal lesions can affect almost any site, salivary gland dysfunction and restricted mouth opening. Short-term patients can experience mucosal sensitivity, malnutrition, problems speaking, increased caries risk, xerostomia, oral pain and a diminished quality-of-life. Long-term complications include secondary malignancies and perhaps early death. Clinical management seeks to alleviate the symptoms and improve quality-of-life but 50% of patients fail front-line systemic steroid therapy. Oral cGVHD can be treated with topical high potency corticosteroids and oral rinses, however these treatments are not always effective and carry a risk of systemic absorption. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) resident in adult and fetal tissues, such as the bone marrow have the capacity to form bone, cartilage, stroma, muscle and fat, are known to exhibit immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. MSC infusions have been used to treat disorders such as osteogenic imperfecta, cardiovascular disease and to heal large bony defects. Indeed, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs have led to infusions being used as a second-line treatment for GVHD patients, and our group has shown within a Phase II clinical trial, 55% aGVHD patients who failed front-line steroid treatment responded to MSC infusion these studies are going with cGVHD patients. The goal of this project is to perform a pilot study to determine whether MSC injections directly into mucosal lesions in patients with oral cGVHD are able to alleviate the symptoms and facilitate the reparative process."

                              "The clinical picture of the novel corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving. Although infections may be mild, up to 25% of all patients admitted to hospital require admission to the intensive care unit, and as many as 40% will progress to develop severe problems breathing due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS often requires mechanical ventilation, with a 50% risk of mortality. Researchers at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) have been studying the potential therapeutic role of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, or MSCs, for the treatment of ARDS for over a decade. This has led to the world's first clinical trial using MSC therapy for patients with severe infections (sepsis) which is often associated with ARDS (NCT02421484). This trial demonstrated tolerability, and potential signs of efficacy. In addition, the investigators have established expertise in producing clinical-grade MSCs and have received approval from Health Canada for the use of MSCs in three different clinical studies.\n\nThis protocol consists of 2 sequential trials using the same trial infrastructure, noted as the Phase 1 trial 'CIRCA-1901' and the Phase 2a trial 'CIRCA-1902'. CIRCA-1901 is an open-label, dose-escalating and safety trial using a 3+3+3 design to determine the safety, and maximum feasible tolerated dose of repeated delivery of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (UC-MSC) intravenously. The investigators will enroll up to 9 patients; each receiving repeated unit doses of UC-MSCs delivered by IV infusion on each of 3 consecutive days (24\u00b14 hours apart) according to the following dose-escalation schedule (3 patients per dose panel): (i) Panel 1: 25 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 75 million MSCs), (ii) Panel 2: 50 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 150 million MSCs), (iii) Panel 3: up to 90 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: up to 270 million MSCs). If no safety issues are identified, we will continue to the Phase 2a trial.\n\nCIRCA-1902 is a single-arm, open-label extension of the CIRCA-1901 trial to assess early signs of efficacy (major morbidity and mortality). The Phase 2a trial (CIRCA-1902) will enroll 12 patients to assess early signals of benefit on mortality and major morbidity in a high risk, high mortality population."

                              "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) to drugs.\n\nTo date, no curative drug has demonstrated with a good level of evidence its ability to promote SJS and TEN healing and could contribute to earlier reepithelialisation. Mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) therapy represents a new therapeutic approach. eg, in patients with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, renal transplantation, lung diseases as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nRecently, MSCs have been proposed in both burn wound healing with a significantly decrease of the unhealed burn area and in cutaneous radiation.\n\nMoreover, MSCs have immunomodulation properties potentially effective in refractory acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) by improving thymic function and induction of Tregs. Indeed, MSCs are able to migrate to inflamed tissues after stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines and to modulate the local inflammatory reactions. MSCs have also demonstrated their ability to promote tissue remodelling, angiogenesis and immunomodulation through either differentiation or secretion of several growth factors such as VEGF, basic FGF and various cytokines.\n\nTherefore, combining their immunomodulation effect and secretion of soluble factors involved in wound repair, MSCs might be valuable as a cell therapy strategy for promoting cutaneous healing in SJS-TEN syndrome and subsequently decrease the morbi-mortality."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and incurable disease for the elderly in Taiwan, so it is an important mission to develop a new treatment for OA. Recently, cellular therapy is a new and popular medical treatment around the world, one of them is \"Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)\". MSCs are found in many tissues of human body and play an important role for repairing, regeneration, anti-inflammatory and chondrogenesis. So, MSC product, RegStem, for osteoarthritis treatment becomes a developing target for new generation drugs.\n\nThis study is to isolate and expand MSCs(RegStem) from infrapatellar fat pad of subject. When the number of MSCs expands to 1\u00d710^8, cell will be cryopreserved in the liquid nitrogen tank until all release tests passed. On the distribution day, cell will be thawed and injected into joint cavity of patient (5\u00d710^7). Subjects will be monitored after MSC product infusion of seven days, one month, six months and one year. The monitoring items include the changes of knee (by appearance, X-ray and MRI of knee) and pain improvement (by questionnaire)."

The first 10 consecutive patients will receive investigational MSCs manufactured by Duke. In the second phase of the study, 40 additional patients will be randomized to receive placebo or investigational MSCs manufactured by Duke or University of Miami.\n\nPatients will be eligible for infusion of 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC or placebo if they have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS.\n\nResults from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the medical literature. Results from the additional 40 patients will be combined with the first 10 and analyzed. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study."

Prognosis is invariably fatal within 3-5 years since manifestation of the disease. Despite improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying ALS, the treatment remains essentially only supportive and focused on symptoms relief. Over the past few years, stem cell research has expanded greatly as a tool for developing new therapies to treat incurable diseases. Stem cell therapy has been shown as promising in several animal ALS models and human clinical trials."

Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. cb-MSCs are a type of tissue helper cell that can be removed from donated umbilical cord blood tissue and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other disease, such as graft versus host disease. This trial aims to learn if adding cb-MSCs to ruxolitinib may help control steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease."

The nature of these cells to immunomodulate both tissue resident and bloodborne immune cells towards a more anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic profile, results in a reduction of tissue-based inflammation within the lung and triggering of repair responses. This clinically culminates in a beneficial action on patients with respiratory complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection."

The trial is based in previous results with autologous MSC (Orozco et al., Transplantation 92: 822-828; 2011). Here we propose a phase I-II trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment DDD using MSV, a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant expanded bone marrow MSC (MSV, PEI Num. 10-134). The assay consists of two arms with 12 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given a single intra-discal transplantation of MSV (25 millions in 2 ml). Control patients will be infiltrated in the paravertebral muscles close to the lesion with 2 ml of 1% mepivacain. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability and quality of life as well as disc fluid content by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (T2-calibrated)."

The trial is based in our own previous results with autologous MSC (ongoing NCT01183728 trial). We propose here a multicenter, phase I-II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment of osteoarthritis (degrees II and III and IV). The assay consists of two arms with 15 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be given an intra-articular transplantation of allogenic MSC, expanded \"Ex Vivo\" with our GMP-compliant procedure (MSV, PEI No. 10-134, authorized by the Competent Authority; same as in NCT01183728). In the control arm a standard treatment with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid shall be given. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability, quality of life and quantitative changes in structure and composition of cartilage determined by T2-weighted MRI relaxation (Cartigram) for one year."

                              "The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases. Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue (ASCs) have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated their ability to evade recognition and actively suppress the immune system.\n\nThis knowledge is transferred into studies with COVID-19 patients having severe pulmonary dysfunction, to modify the virus induced immunological and inflammatory activity involved in the progression of disease often leading to prolonged ICU stay and in some occasion's death.\n\nWe will conduct a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary symptoms will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic CSCC_ASCs from adipose tissue. The aim is to assess the impact of CSCC_ASCs on the activated immune system and clinical efficacy on pulmonary function.\n\nThe perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be a paradigm shift for the clinical problems and severe outcome seen in some patients with severe COVID-19 and other severe diseases with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome."

                              "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is considered a public health problem. The World Health Organization estimates that about 210 million people have COPD. Disease-related mortality is more than 3 million, representing 5% of all deaths, 90% of this mortality being concentrated in middle- and low-income countries. COPD can be subdivided into chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Emphysema, the focus of this project, is histologically defined by the permanent increase of the distal air spaces to the terminal bronchioles associated with the destruction of the alveolar septa in the lung. Approximately two-thirds of adult men and a quarter of women (most without dysfunction) will have well-defined emphysema, but often of limited extent.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, microbicide and repair potential. Regarding COPD, several authors have concentrated efforts in the investigation of the relationship between the severity of the condition and the various sources of adult stem cells. Apparently the lungs have a high chemotactic effect in relation to adult stem cells, since several studies have evidenced a high implantation (6-20%) of stem cells derived from bone marrow, administered systemically, in the pulmonary tissue of receptors. Therefore, MSCs has been tested in different lung diseases have no effective treatment, such as pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, COPD positive results, such as reduction of fibrosis, reduction of proliferation inflammatory cells and cytokines, reduction of infectious processes and recovery of the histological changes caused by pulmonary emphysema.\n\nBased on these findings, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic administration of bone marrow stem cells in patients with severe homogeneous emphysema and evaluating the feasibility, efficacy and safety of this procedure."

                              "The mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2-related severe ARDS is high despite treatment with antivirals, glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, and ventilation. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that MSCs migrate to the lung and respond to the pro-inflammatory lung environment by releasing anti-inflammatory factors reducing the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines while modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages to promote resolution of inflammation. Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in management of COVID-19 induced ARDS.\n\nThe primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of MSCs on inflammatory biomarkers."

                              "The COVID-19 pandemic, commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", first began in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. This virus has since spread globally, with infections reported in nearly every country. COVID-19 targets the body's respiratory system, where infections can be found in the nose, throat and lungs. The effect of COVID-19 infection is very variable, where many people might not know that they have been infected and have recovered from COVID-19. However, COVID-19 infection can cause people to have difficulty breathing. This can be severe enough to require hospitalisation and potentially intensive care treatment.\n\nWhile they are being treated in hospital, COVID-19 infected patients can be found to have inflamed tissue in their lungs (referred to medically as \"pneumonitis\"). This inflammation is thought to be caused by their body's immune systems overacting to the infection rather than the COVID-19 virus itself. By potentially dampening down this overreaction of their immune system, it is hoped that COVID-19 patients with inflamed lungs have better and quicker chance to survive.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and healing properties on injured tissue. MSCs have been trialled in various diseases but have not yet been tested on patients with COVID-19. In this study, the investigators will obtain bone marrow from healthy volunteers to develop a cell-based treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonitis. The investigators will also determine whether it is feasible to recruit bone marrow donors in a clinically useful timeframe to treat COVID-19 patients. A future trial, COMET20, will use the bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) manufactured in COMET20d to treat COVID-19 patients suffering with pneumonitis, to determine whether the BMMSCs can reduce the likelihood for mechanical ventilation and reduce hospitalisation."

Twenty adult patients (age 18 years or older) with refractory, complicated perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore\u00ae Bio-A\u00ae fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. This will be done by starting at a low dose of MSCs and moving on to the next higher dose level provided there are no safety concerns. Researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

Giving low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a co-transplant of donor umbilical cord blood and mesenchymal stromal cells into the bone (intra-osseous) helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil at the time of transplant may stop this from happening."

Donor MSCs can serve as a source of recovery for niches in patients with graft failure (GF) after allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation. Since only few MSCs reach the BM after intravenous injection, MSCs were implanted into the iliac spine. Preliminary results suggest that MSCs participate in the restoration of niches for donor hematopoietic cells or have an immunomodulatory effect, preventing repeated rejection of the graft. Perhaps intraosseous implantation of MSCs contributes to the success of the second transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells and patient survival."

                              "Acute Liver Failure in children is associated with high mortality without liver transplantation. In addition, donor organ shortage makes it difficult to provide this treatment to every potential patient. Liver transplantation is life-saving but it carries the risk of major surgery and complications from lifelong anti-rejection drugs to suppress the immune system. If bridged across the immediate crisis following acute liver failure, the immense regenerative potential of the liver means that the patient's own liver may 're-grow'. This period is very time sensitive. Unfortunately, if the vital synthetic and detoxification function of the liver is not provided, the patient will often die before the liver can re-grow.\n\nTransplantation of liver cells (hepatocytes) can provide this 'bridge' with considerable advantages over whole organ transplantation. Firstly, hepatocytes are derived from donor livers which are otherwise unsuitable for transplantation. Secondly, unlike whole organs, they can be frozen and stored, thus act as an 'off the shelf' treatment. Thirdly, the technique of hepatocyte transplantation within microbeads coated with alginate (a gel originating from seaweed) and infused into the abdominal cavity is much less invasive than liver transplantation. Finally, the alginate protects the cells against the body's immune system, avoiding the need for immunosuppressive drugs and the associated major risks. Furthermore, preclinical work in King's College Hospital has shown that the addition of support cells called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), can significantly improve the ability of hepatocytes to survive and function within the alginate microbead.\n\nThe HELP trial is a Phase 1/2 safety and tolerability study of infusion of HMB002 (an optimal combination of hepatocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells put together in peptide-alginate microbeads) into paediatric patients with acute liver failure. This novel cellular therapy may act as a bridge treatment to liver transplant or lead to regeneration of the native liver."

                              "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC) implantation on pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth with pulp necrosis and chronic apical periodontitis.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nPost-traumatic pulp necrosis prevents root development in children and adolescents.\nThe multipotent ability of MSC to differentiate into bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) and dentin-forming cells (Odontoblast) has allowed the development of protocols to induce dental pulp regeneration in preclinical models and patients with immature teeth with pulpal necrosis.\n\nIMPACT:\n\nWorldwide, post-traumatic pulp necrosis in children and adolescents constitutes a health problem in the endodontic area.\nTreatment with MSC would provide an effective therapeutic alternative to patients with pulp necrosis and incomplete root formation.\nThe possible pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth induced by MSC would have a huge impact on the treatment of these patients.\n\nEligibility for EMC implant study Age: 6 to 16 years Sex: Male or Female Healthy volunteers accepted: NO.\n\nTREATMENT GROUPS:\n\nIn the present study, the implantation of MSC will be performed in patients with immature teeth with pulpal necrosis with apical periodontitis, who will receive the appropriate endodontic treatment (according to the guidelines of the American Association of Endodontics) and implantation of allogeneic BM-MSC . This group will be compared with the history made in the Postgraduate Endodontics of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) and with international case series made by revascularization.\n\nClinical follow-up of each patient:\n\nClinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of MSC.\nRadiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of MSC.\nA tomographic evaluation will be performed when was evident periapical repair in a periapical radiograph. To measure root formation, root canal narrowing and verification the periapical repair in 3D."

                              "Despite being a miracle of modern medicine, solid organ transplant recipients are always at risk of rejection, and remain dependent on lifelong immunosuppression. Currently used immunosuppressive drugs suppress the potential of immune system and interfere with the metabolism of medications. Cellular therapies currently being investigated for this purpose require the use of ablative radiotherapy. The investigators are using a less toxic strategy by harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of the MSCs in the Kidney Transplant (KTx) recipients and studying immunomodulation mediated by these cells in the KTx patients.\n\nHypothesis MSCs interfere with signalling of Immune cells like T cells, B cells and Dendritic cells which leads to improve graft survival of renal transplant patients.\n\nAim To investigate effect of MSCs on immune cell repertoire in a donor specific mediated response.\n\nThe investigators aim to collect peripheral blood from 30 patients (10 patients for autologous cell infusion and 10 for allogeneic (donor derived cell infusion) at various time intervals following MSC therapy. 10 patients serve as controls on standard dose of drugs but without MSC infusion. This peripheral blood would be utilized for isolation of mononuclear cells and performing various immune assays on these cells in a donor specific response."

The project intends to transplant autologous MSCs to ten peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra-filtration failure. It's going to study infusion effects in clinical, cellular and molecular levels.\n\nSo in this trial, we will evaluate the effects of this intervention after intravenous injection of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in 10 peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra filtration failure (UFF).

                              "Femoro-acetabular impingement is a well known cause of damage to the acetabular labrum and chondrolabral junction. Additionally, it has been proposed that disruption of hip biomechanics resulting from a labral tear causes a faster progression towards osteoarthritis (OA). This progression has been observed to begin with breakdown of the chondrolabral junction with later development of diffuse osteoarthritis. Use of hip arthroscopy has increased dramatically in recent years to treat symptomatic labral tears and potentially avoid the morbidity and cost associated with hip osteoarthritis.\n\nCorrection of labral pathology presents a technical challenge and many techniques currently exist. Increased understanding of the structure-functional relationship dictated by labral anatomy has led to the development of methods aimed at restoring functional anatomy by re-establishing the labrum's native position and contour on the rim of the acetabulum. Therefore, akin to repairing a torn meniscus in the knee, restoring the anatomic footprint of a torn labrum will reconstitute normal joint biomechanics.\n\nDespite the advances in techniques for labral repair, strategies for mitigating or repairing damage to the chondrolabral junction do not yet exist. This area has been shown to consist of hyaline and fibro cartilage. Many techniques for cartilage repair exist, although most are not feasible due to technical challenges specific to the hip joint.\n\nThe management of articular cartilage defects is one of the most challenging clinical problems for orthopaedic surgeons. Articular cartilage has a limited intrinsic healing capacity, and pathology frequently results in gradual tissue deterioration. Currently, the standard surgical intervention for end-stage degenerative joint pathology is total joint replacement. Early surgical interventions for symptomatic cartilage lesions including cell based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) implantation, or microfracture have been suggested to restore normal joint congruity and minimize further joint deterioration. Techniques such as ACI, which have been successfully used in the knee joint, have limited application in the hip due to the technical difficulties of open procedures."

Pre-clinical sepsis studies suggest that mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells may modulate inflammation, enhance pathogen clearance and tissue repair and reduce death. Our team has completed a Phase I dose escalation and safety clinical trial that evaluated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients with septic shock. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial established that MSCs appear safe and that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is feasible. Based on these data, the investigators have planned a phase II RCT (CISS2) at several Canadian academic centres which will evaluate safety, signals for clinical efficacy, and continue to examine potential mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock."

MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from progression to advanced heart failure."

EPCs are the source of cells protecting the inner lining of blood vessels and improving their survivability will improve cardiovascular outcome as high glucose environment of diabetes are toxic to these EPC Cells.\n\nImprove mitochondrial metabolism of Mesenchymal Stem Cell from subcutaneous fatty tissue, leading to weight loss. Improve overall vascular health by reducing inflammation.\n\nThe investigator will enroll 40 subjects with T2DM who are only on metformin. The study consists of 4 visits to the GW MFA, including screening visit. Subjects will be recruited from across the DMV area, and prescreened over the phone or in clinic, and then invited for an in-person screening visit at the GW MFA to determine eligibility. If eligible, subject will be enrolled into one of two study Arms, active semaglutide 1 mg or Placebo. This study will include an up titration of study drug. From week 0-4 subject will be on 0.25 mg/week, from week 5-8 subject will take 0.5mg/week, and week 9 to 24 subject will take 1 mg/week of Semaglutide or Placebo.\n\nDuring the regular 3 visits subject will have their vital measured, body composition assessed using Tanita scale, arterial stiffness measured and blood drawn for EPC cells analysis and standard of care labs. At visit 1 and visit 3, fat biopsy will be done on the belly area to acquire 2-3 grams of fat tissue. Screening will take place at week -2, Visit1 at week 0, Visit 2 at week 8, Visit 3 at week 24. Subject will receive follow-up phone calls on week 4, week16 and week 28."

One cord blood unit will be expanded by this method while another cord blood unit will be infused without manipulation. The expanded cord blood unit will help boost the initial recovery of blood counts after transplantation, though it is expected that the unexpanded cord blood unit will provide the cells which will lead to long term engraftment of blood stem cells. A third cord blood unit will be identified for standby should the cord blood unit expansion fail."

This constitutes one cycle of treatment. Each patient will receive 3 cycles of treatment at 21 day intervals. The aim of phase 1 is to estimate the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MSCTRAIL in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy.\n\nDuring the phase II study patients will be randomised to either the intervention or the control arm of the study. All patients in both arms will receive cisplatin and pemetrexed on day one of treatment. Patients randomised to the intervention arm will receive the recommended dose of MSCTRAIL from Phase I on day 2 whilst those in the control arm will receive a placebo. As this is a double blind trial both patients and the clinical team will not know whether they are receiving MSCTRAIL or a placebo product. The aim of phase 2 is to assess tolerability and preliminary efficacy of MSCTRAIL in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy."

                              "Ulcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by diffuse inflammation of the colonic mucosa. It affects the rectum and extends proximally along a variable length of the colon. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition with a relapsing remitting course. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a subset of adult stem cells residing in many tissues, including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues. The purpose of our study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope of allogeneic adipose MSCs in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis."

                              "Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mediated by stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) which leads to donor T-lymphocytes activation and target tissue destruction, particularly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver in acute setting. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.\n\nObjective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics\u00ae umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.\n\nStudy design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.\n\nFor Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20 patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.\n\nCyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires."

                              "Progressive SSc is an entity with limited therapeutic alternatives and with asurvival rate of less than 45% in the first 3 to 5 years. The disease causessevere limitation in quality of life ranging from functional limitation to depression. Up to 20% of patients will be refractory to conventional treatment with diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and cyclophosphamide therapy.This favors the progression to visceral involvement including gastrointestinal,lung and pulmonary hypertension. The latter being a poor prognostic factor,increases mortality in this group of patients and drastically affects their qualityof life. For this reason, different therapeutic options have been considered including cell transplantation and Stem Cell use. Among the options that have been studied so far are stromal mesenchymal cells from Wharton \u0301s jelly. These have been used in intravenous infusion or direct application in different disease scenarios ranging from vascular involvement to interstitial lung involvement and cases of pulmonary hypertension, with promising results in terms of clinical progression,improvement in quality of life and prognostic indices. This therapy has proven to have a significant margin of safety at the time of administration and a low rate of adverse events, a self-limiting fever as the most frequent event. Based on the above and considering the possibility of offering patients without therapeutic alternatives to their disease in addition to palliative options, an intravenous infusion of stromal mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton \u0301s jellyis proposed for three patients with progressive SSc refractory to conventional therapy with pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension.\n\nUnder this premise the question posed in our work is; What are the effects of the infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells from Wharton \u0301s jellyin patients with systemic sclerosis refractory to conventional treatment with Methotrexate or Cyclophosphamide in a population of three patients with severe pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension."

Survivors are typically left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness, quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No agent has been found to be highly effective in halting disease activity.Based on recent outcomes of Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, and based on the mechanisms of neuromyelitis optica, the investigators anticipate that mesenchymal stem cells transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for neuromyelitis optica patients."

The LOC can be an important source of pain and affects comparatively younger, working age and athletically active patients.\n\nAlthough there are several therapeutic strategies, debridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically are the most frequent procedures. After this surgery, it is expected that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Though good results have been reported, this fibrocartilage presents histological characteristics of lower quality to those of the native articular cartilage.\n\nBased on previous studies in different joints, it is hypothesized that the augmentation treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal allogeneic stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with debridement and microfractures only.\n\nTherefore, the present study seeks to compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus."

                              "cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) about 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD."

                              "The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue. Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized, single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed."

                              "Articular cartilage defects in the knee have a poor intrinsic healing capacity and may lead to functional disability and osteoarthritis. Cartilage cell therapy using autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy medicinal product. Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly and extensive two-stage procedure which is limited by the number of chondrocytes obtained by biopsy and the dedifferentiation resulting from the expansion phase. Therefore, there is a need for improvement. A new cartilage repair technique should aim at decreasing surgical trauma, lowering complexity, improving logistics and cost-effectiveness while retaining or improving clinical outcome. Direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes in vitro showed improvement of the chondrogenic phenotype of dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. In addition, preserving the pericellular matrix of chondrocytes improves cartilage formation. These chondrons (chondrocytes with their pericellular matrix) have shown improved cartilage formation when combined with allogeneic MSCs in extensive preclinical studies. The cells are mixed with fibrin cell carrier and applied to the cartilage lesion within one surgical procedure. This will reduce patient morbidity and improve patient care through immediate transplantation of a potent cell-based cartilage product. This is a phase I/II prospective monocenter study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the IMPACT for treatment of focal articular cartilage lesions of the knee."

                              "There is a growing interest in generating dendritic cells (DCs) for using as vaccines. Several cytokines, especially stem cell factor (SCF) and FLT3-ligand (FL), have been identified as essential to produce large numbers of myeloid precursors and even to increase DC yield obtained by the action of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). However, there are few studies on the effect of the early-acting cytokines, commonly used to expand CD34+ progenitor cells, on DC generation.\n\nWe have established a serious of functional analysis of maturated or immaturated DCs including surface markers screening or cytokine production. Here, we design this two-year project to evaluate the possible methodology in the generation of CD14+CD1a- and CD14- CD1a+ myeloid DC precursors from CD34+ cells. In the first year of the project, we will set up the standard protocol to generate DC precursors from cord blood stem cells. In the first step, we will isolate CD34+ cells from cord blood and amplify these cells. Purity of the CD34+ cell populations obtained will be greater than 90%. In the next step, these primary cultures of CD34+ cells will treat with early-acting cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-4 to further induction into dendritic cells. Functional analysis of dendritic cells would be performed in this stage. In the second year of the project, we will further evaluate the induction of DCs by CD34+ stem cells could be affected by combination of mesenchymal stromal cells. These results of this research with CD34+-based DCs induction provide the basis for materials to develop the DC-based vaccine against viral and fungal infections, and might be a powerful tool in anti-tumor immunotherapy."

                              "The administration of the tranexamic acid (TRAXA), an antifibrinolytic, blocks primary fibrinolysis, and thus the haemorrhage, in the early postoperative period. Significant surgical operations, as well as trauma, initiate a similar dynamic homeostatic mechanism between the creation of a clot (primary and secondary haemostasis) and its dissolution (fibrinolysis). Antifibrinolytics have been proven effective in reducing haemorrhage in patients who have undergone significant surgical operations with normal fibrinolysis, with the use of an appropriate surgical technique.\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that peak fibrinolytic activity is present for 6 hours after the incision and it persists for 18 hours in total knee and hip arthroplasty. The administration of the tranexamic acid in optional orthopaedic surgery of total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty reduces the postoperative haemorrhage, as well as the number and volume of the postoperative autologous blood.\n\nA trauma in the organism triggers the immunologic response. New term has been introduced - the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI), characterised by: a change on the immunologic cells (neutrophilia, monocytosis, increased number of mesenchymal stromal cells, reduced expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells, increased lymphocyte apoptosis, a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by Treg lymphocytes - CD4+CD25+CD127-); a change in production levels of various cytokines (anti-inflammatory cytokines): IL-10, IL-4; anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine: IL-6; pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3); the activation of the complement system (C5a and C3a via factor VII - tissue factor system, activated by cell damage).\n\nPost-traumatic immunosuppression can be made worse by transfusion, haemorrhage, stress, significant surgical operation and immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nThe research has shown that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).\n\nStopping haemorrhage prevents the occurrence of anaemia, as well as the need for transfusion of blood products, which lead to developing the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI)."

                              "This study is an observational study of MIF involvement in retrospectively and prospectively included adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Standard care samples collected at diagnosis, after one course of treatment, at time of remission controls, and at time of relapse will be used.\n\nThe first objective is to determine which AMLs have pre-leukemic stem cells that overexpress MIF. Cytogenetic and molecular (NGS) profiling will be performed at diagnosis. Blood and bone marrow plasma, as well as bone marrow mononuclear cells will be collected and stored. The expression of MIF and its receptor (CD74 and CXCR4) will be analysed. Their prognostic value will be also tested.\n\nThe second objective is to test whether patients in complete remission have persistent pre-leukemic stem cells that overexpress MIF. Blood and bone marrow plasma, bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients in complete remission will be collected. MIF, CD74, and CXCR4 expression by hematopoietic cells at time of diagnosis and remission will be compared to determine which patients have a persistent overexpression/secretion of MIF. In the meantime, the persistence of initiating lesions in complete remission samples will be tested by NGS, digital PCR, FISH, or RT-PCR methods.\n\nThe third objective is to develop a pre-clinical model to target MIF in immuno-compromised mice (NSG mice) transplanted with primary AML cells and cells with pre-leukemic lesions. TET2 depletion leads to MIF over-expression/secretion by hematopoietic cells and improved multi-lineage NSG-repopulation capacity. MIF inhibitors and anti-MIF antibodies will be tested in these pre-clinical TET2-depleted models. Xenotransplantation of selected primary AML samples and xenotransplantation of TET2 depleted hematopoietic stem cells into NSG mice will be used.\n\nThe fourth objective is to understand how MIF is deregulated in pre-leukemic stem cells and how the MIF-dependent crosstalk between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and pre-leukemic stem cells or normal hematopoietic cells works.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms of MIF overexpression will be analyzed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from normal and leukemic bone marrow, with a focus on cells depleted in TET2 or DNMT3A. To study the cross-talk between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, pre-leukemic stem cells, and bone marrow MSCs, co-culture experiments will be performed using available MSC cell lines and primary MSCs from healthy donors."

The discovery of a resident population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within synovial fluid (SF) was the first description of this reparative cell population having direct access to superficial cartilage and joint structures. The ready access of SF MSC to cartilage and other joint tissues offers a novel strategy for joint repair. Current arthroscopic procedures result in the removal of all SF MSCs due to continuous irrigation throughout the procedure. The current study would benefit the patient by greatly increasing the reparative capacity of the joint by bolstering MSC numbers and retaining those MSCs within the joint after surgery. By accessing MSCs from the synovium it is anticipated that these cells would be entrapped/migrate into the marrow clot formed by microfracture of the sub-chondral bone. These MSCs would supplement those from the marrow and may result in faster, better quality repair."

                              "The first-in-human Phase 1 study component will evaluate two dose levels of RAPA-501-ALLO off the shelf cells in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, with key endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501 ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As of April 6th, 2021, an estimated 132.1 million people have contracted the virus and 2,866,000 deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 30.8 million people diagnosed and 556,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation) caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such, therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes hyperinflammation due to \"cytokine storm\" and \"chemokine storm,\" tissue damage, hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.\n\nStage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6 therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3 COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.\n\nRAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are \"reprogrammed\" ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a \"hybrid\" product. The hybrid phenotype inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS."

After prostatectomy, 80% experience erectile dysfunction. Sexual life is a central part of people's identity, self-esteem and quality of life. Stem cells have generated a large amount of promising data suggesting that stem cells can alleviate erectile dysfunction, by regenerating nerves as well as endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernous."

                              "Periodontitis are inflammatory diseases characterized by the destruction of the tooth-supporting bone due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCLs). Two forms are described: chronic periodontitis (CP) and aggressive periodontitis (AP) that differ by the severity and rapidity of bone loss, much more important for AP than CP. In both forms, the link with uncontrolled activation of the immune system is largely admitted. Despite the physiopathology of CP is fairly well studied, very few data are available regarding AP. The investigators aim is to understand the severity of AP by analyzing the proportion and action of immune and mesnchymal cells potentially involved in bone destruction, on biopsies of periodontal granulation tissue (surgical waste) and blood. Three groups of 20 patients will be included: affected with AP, CP or controls (necessitating an extraction of wisdom teeth)."

Commonly, the fixation is obtained by bone ingrowth between the prosthesis and the native bone. Thus, the quality of the patient's bone stock is essential to achieve this aim. However, several clinical conditions may impair the bone stock; therefore, in these cases bone grafts are necessary to improve the prosthetic fixation. The gold standard is represented by autologous bone grafts (from iliac crest or from acetabular bone chips) or allogeneic bone grafts from cadaveric femoral heads. Nevertheless, the osteogenic potential of multipotent cells derived from different anatomical regions has never been examined.\n\nThus, the aim of this study is to isolate multipotent cells from acetabular or femoral bone chips and from bone marrow aspirate of the same patient and to compare their osteogenic potential. The results of this study may reveal differences, which may have a clinical relevance for hip replacement surgery."

The BMSC in this study were grown from bone marrow from healthy volunteers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test whether BMSC are safe to use soon after GVHD is diagnosed and to see how the body s immune system responds to BMSC.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- People over 4 years old who had a stem cell transplant at NIH and now have acute GVHD. People who have had certain previous immunosuppressive therapy may be ineligible.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They will have a GVHD exam, including skin and stool tests. They must have a functioning central line.\nParticipation will last 11 weeks: 4 8 weeks of cell infusions, then follow-up for the rest of the weeks.\nUp to 12 cell infusions:\nParticipants will come to the clinic twice weekly.\nThey will get medicine to prevent side effects (like Tylenol and Benadryl).\nBMSC will be given through a small plastic tube in an arm vein or through an IV catheter. It will last 20 60 minutes.\nParticipants will be monitored for 1 hour.\nFollow-up visits: Up to twice a week, participants will have physical exam and blood tests. They may have a GVHD exam.\nParticipants who have a tissue biopsy outside the study will be asked to send a sample to the study."

                              "Rotator cuff disease (i.e., rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear) is a common cause of shoulder pain in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). It usually resolves with non-operative treatments such as pharmacological agents and physical therapy; however, when this fails, rotator cuff surgery may be the only option. Corticosteroid injections are another alternative to provide temporary relief, but can over time accelerate degeneration of the tendon and lead to further damage. Autologous adipose tissue injection has recently emerged as a promising new treatment for joint pain and soft tissue injury. Adipose can be used to provide cushioning and filling of structural defects and has been shown to have an abundance of bioactive elements and regenerative perivascular cells (pericytes). The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems\u00ae) injection under ultrasound guidance for chronic shoulder pain in persons with SCI compared with the standard-of-care, corticosteroid injection."

                              "Knee injuries are common among active-duty military personnel. One of the most common knee injuries is a meniscus tear, which can have several consequences. Immediately, the soldier may be separated from the military for over one year or assigned a permanent activity limiting duty profile. Over time, meniscal tears may also increase the risk of other knee injuries, such as osteoarthritis, which is one of the most common medical reasons for discharge from active duty service. The current standard of care includes conservative treatments, such as physical therapy and rest. Once conservative treatments fail, surgery is generally the next option. However, there is limited evidence that surgery is effective and some studies suggest it can accelerate the development of osteoarthritis. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a regenerative treatment for meniscal tears termed micro-fragmented adipose tissue in reducing pain and restoring activity levels. We will recruit active-duty military personnel and civilians with meniscal tears and provide them with either the adipose tissue treatment or a control treatment consisting of saline. We will then follow these individuals for up to one year and evaluate differences in pain and function between the two groups. The ultimate goal is to show that micro-fragmented adipose tissue is a viable alternative for the treatment of meniscal tears in active-duty military personnel."

                              "Rationale Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are rare cancers with unmet medical needs. Study of MDS has been rapidly transformed by genome characterization.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that comprehensive analyses of large patient population will allow to correctly estimate the effect of each mutation on clinical outcomes, and that niche factors and immune dysfunctions may influence the development of MDS, clonal evolution and response to treatments\n\nAims\n\n1- Investigate gene mutations, niche factors and immune dysfunctions influencing the development of MDS, and define biomarkers for early identification of individuals at risk; 2- Develop prognostic models for MDS patients through integration of comprehensive genomic/clinical information; 3- Define biomarkers to better stratify the individual probability of response to specific treatments\n\nMethods EuroBloodNet, the European Reference Network in rare hematological diseases, will provide a basis for research activities. Study of genomic features of clonal dominance in elderly subjects enrolled in large population-based studies and description of the dynamics of clonal establishment and evolution; study of bone marrow microenvironment to identify immune dysfunctions influencing MDS development. Development of inclusive statistical models to accurately predict clinical outcome at individual level, based on large MDS populations with comprehensive genomic/clinical data. Finally, analysis of mutational screening and immune profiles from patients enrolled in prospective trials, to provide evidence on genetic/immunologic profiles associated with probability of response to specific compounds\n\nExpected results To characterize how clonal hematopoiesis relates to the induction of MDS clinical phenotype, and to test the utility of gene sequencing to detect subjects at risk of developing MDS. To define effective prognostic systems and biomarkers to stratify the individual probability of response to treatment"

                              "Hemophilia is a constitutional coagulation disorder responsible for a hemorrhagic phenotype in patients from an early age. Hemarthrosis is one of the most frequent complications in hemophiliacs and leads to the development of severe and early arthropathy, sometimes as early as childhood. To date, there is no curative treatment for these joint disorders and preventive treatments are insufficient to completely prevent joint degradation. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to be of therapeutic interest in the management of pathologies such as osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis through their anti-inflammatory, regenerative and anti-apoptotic effects. Hemophilic arthropathy is a separate condition at the border of these two diseases Our study aim to show pre-clinical interest of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in hemophilic arthropathy"

                              "Masquelet's induced membrane technique is a two-stage reconstructive surgery for severe bone fractures commonly used by military orthopedists. The particularity of this technique relies on the synthesis of a biological membrane induced by the transient implantation of a surgical cement (= 1st stage surgery). The presence of the induced membrane in the reconstruction space defines a microenvironment or \"biological chamber\" favourable to osteogenesis, positively influencing the repair of the lesion after implantation of an autologous bone graft (= 2nd stage of surgery).\n\nIn view of the excellent clinical results obtained with this procedure, the Masquelet technique has gradually become a reference treatment in the field of orthopedic and trauma surgery.\n\nHowever, orthopedic surgeons sometimes observe failures in bone consolidation. To our knowledge, the role played by induced membrane in these therapeutic failures has never been studied."

                              "Rotator cuff disease (i.e., rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear) is a common cause of shoulder pain in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). It usually resolves with non-operative treatments such as pharmacological agents and physical therapy; however, when this fails, rotator cuff surgery may be the only option. Autologous adipose tissue injection has recently emerged as a promising new treatment for joint pain and soft tissue injury. Adipose can be used to provide cushioning and filling of structural defects and has been shown to have an abundance of bioactive elements and regenerative perivascular cells (pericytes). The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems\u00ae) injection under ultrasound guidance for chronic shoulder pain in persons with SCI."

This leads to pain, loss of mobility and can be a major handicap for some patients.\n\nGonarthrosis, or osteoarthritis of the knee, affects 30% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 and is one of the most disabling conditions. In the final stage, the only therapeutic option to relieve patients is to replace the joint with a total knee prosthesis.\n\nThanks to the contribution of an evaluation technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS device), our objective is to better evaluate and understand the movement deficit in knee OA subjects.\n\nThe hypothesis is that, thanks to the contribution of a technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS), the investigators can better evaluate the movement deficit of knee OA subjects. The goal is to propose specific, rapid telekinetic biomarkers, allowing a better evaluation of functional improvements following therapeutic interventions, such as a total knee replacement."

                              "Actively developing stem cells (SCs) transplantation techniques cause natural interest to the problem of regeneration in the lungs. Numerous experimental studies proved the benefits of different types of SCs in experimental models of pulmonary emphysema (PE).\n\nG. Zhen et al. have shown that the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rats with papain-induced emphysema leads to their migration into the lungs, differentiation into type 2 alveolocytes, and inhibition of apoptosis and prevention PE.\n\nK. Schweitzer et al. have proved the activity of inflammation in the airways, alveolocytes and endothelial cells apoptosis decreased after adipose SCs intravenous administration to mice with emphysema caused by chronic exposure to tobacco smoke or VEGF receptors blockade. The study of E.P. Ingenito et al. found that endobronchial installed MSCs engraft into the alveolar wall and peribronchial interstitium and release integrins, extracellular matrix components (collagen IV, laminin and fibrillin), platelet-derived growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor \u03b22.\n\nOur study also found reliable deterrent effect of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs on the development of elastase-induced emphysema in rats at different terms of transplantation.\n\nAfter the success of pilot studies have started clinical trials. Currently, the website http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov reported three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in patients with COPD and emphysema. Two of them have already been completed and the results of the first pilot project published.\n\nAuthors on the example of 4 patients showed a complete absence of adverse effects, improved quality of life and stability of functional parameters at 12 months after starting treatment One of the problems of MSC transplantation in patients with respiratory failure is an accelerated apoptosis of transplanted cells under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Since it is proved that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxia increases their survival in hypoxic conditions, increases the expression of growth factors and antiinflammatory cytokines, we suppose that MSCs grown in hypoxic medium may have a significant positive effect on the disease."

                              "Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing. The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.\n\nIn addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.\n\nMSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19 Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective.\n\nThe current Phase I/II study of adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal stem cells is conducted with the broad objective of establishing safety and efficacy."

The aim of the present study will be to compare in a randomized non blind controlled clinical trial 3 types of intra-articular injections containing MSC populations obtained from two clinically relevant sources: BM-MSC, AD-MSC and a combination of both BM-MSC and AD-MSC."

                              "Although, effective immunotherapies for MS exist which downregulate the anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of the disease, there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce remyelination. Neuronal stem cells were shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.\n\nIn this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and restoration of neuronal function.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.\n\nSignificance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in general."

                              "Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.\n\nTherefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new opportunities for development of the same.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue.14\n\nAs limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been undertaken to explore the tolerability & effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC in second treatment arm in IPF patients.\n\nAdipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in preclinical studies to be safe and effective"

                              "Background: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a potent alkylating agent that targets several organs, especially lung tissue. SM exposure leads to serious changes in morphological structure of airway system, which is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary deficiency following exposure to SM. With extensive progress and achievements in tissue repair through stem cells therapy, consideration of lung tissue has been increased due to the high prevalence of pulmonary problems. Several factors such as selection of cell types, required conditions for growth and proliferation of stem cells, and the process of entering into the body to repair damaged lung tissue are considered as the most important problems in this issue. Accumulating studies, both in animals and human with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) support the hypothesis of therapeutic effects of these cells in various disorders. In this study investigators aimed to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of systemic MSC administration for treatment of chronic lung injuries in SM-exposed patients.\n\nMethods: Patients will receive 100 million MSC cells every two months for three injections within 6 months. After each injection, parameters including safety, pulmonary function testing (PFT), quality-of-life indicators, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), and expression of inflammation and oxidative stress genes will be evaluated."

                              "Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a kind of mesenchymal tumor with malignant differentiation potential. It originated from mesenchymal stem cells of gastrointestinal tract.The most common is that gastric stromal tumors(GST) make up 60-70% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.The first choice for the treatment of non-metastatic gastric stromal tumors is to ensure the integrity of the tumor and obtain the negative surgical margin.At present, the common surgical methods of resection of gastric stromal tumors include laparotomy and laparoscopy, most of them are partial gastrectomy, wedge-shaped resection, proximal subtotal gastrectomy, distal subtotal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy, etc.There was no significant difference between open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.With the rapid development of endoscopic technology in recent years, endoscopes have been continuously explored in practice.Laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery(LECS) is different from the past technology. It is a new radical resection of GIST presented by Japanese scholars. LECS resects the tumor completely by laparoscopy with the help of the precise positioning and guidance of endoscopy .This method conforms to the idea of the modern minimally invasive surgery, and avoids many problems\uff0csuch as incomplete resection and disorders of digestion caused by excessive tissue resection. Investigators will observe the diffenrence of LECS and traditional laparoscopic surgeries.Firstly,the investigators will collect 80 cases of GST patients, randomly assigned for the laparoscopic group, the LECS surgical treatment. Secondly, to analyzing the basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time, blood loss, the number of transfer laparotomy or laparoscopy, the number of cut edge positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, the cases of anastomotic fistula bleeding, stenosis, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency, reflux esophagitis, bile reflux gastritis and other indicators.The purpose of this subject is to observe the effectivity and safety of LECS , invent serval LECS equipment patents and provide some references for LECS applying to the minimally invasive surgery of the digestive tract tumor and multidisciplinary treatment mode.It also provides reference for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, ectopic pancreas, carcinoid, early carcinomas, giant adenomas and polyps."

                              "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) causes the lungs to fail due to the collection of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema). ARDS is common in severely ill patients in Intensive Care Units and is associated with a high mortality and a high morbidity in those who survive. ARDS occurs in approximately 20% case of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. There is a large economic burden with direct healthcare costs, but also indirectly due to the impact on the carer and patient through the patients inability to return to full time employment. There is little evidence for effective drug (pharmacological) treatment for ARDS. There is increasing information that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might be important in treating ARDS. REALIST will investigate if a single infusion of MSCs will help in the treatment of ARDS. The first step will be to first of all determine what dose of MSCs is safe and then divide patients suffering from ARDS into two groups, one of which will get MSCs and the other a harmless dummy (or placebo) infusion, who will then be followed up to determine if lung function improves. If effective this may lead to further research to determine if MSCs are effective in patients with ARDS."

                              "Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and the incidence rate in China has increased year by year in recent years.Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are not sensitive to radiotherapy and traditional infusion chemotherapy. Currently, they are generally treated with surgery, but they are prone to recurrence and metastasis.For nodules with a particle size between 2 and 5 cm, there may be both benign and malignant, and there is still a lack of fast and accurate methods for distinguishing benign and malignant.Many benign nodules were removed (in the pathological examination of postoperative resected tissue). In addition, if it is found to be late, there is a possibility of invading surrounding tissues and metastasis, so that it is impossible to cure. Therefore, early diagnosis and early surgery and benign and malignant differentiation of small nodules are the key to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.At present, second-generation gene sequencing (NGS) and liquid biopsy are rarely reported in the field of GIST. A few domestic and foreign studies have found that it can detect rare mutation types, and may find secondary gene mutations early, which has potential applicability, but Overall, the clinical guidance of these NGS-based studies focuses on prognosis and drug resistance , as well as some studies based on low-throughput platforms. Therefore, early diagnosis and benign and malignant discrimination based on high-throughput sequencing and liquid biopsy have significant clinical significance for the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors."

                              "Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination. The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs. Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin.Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow derived MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.\n\nOur center will perform a clinical trial with intra venous transplantation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell.our purpose is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of cell transplantation after 1year following up."

                              "Treatment of ischemic myocardium has been the subject of intense research in recent years and stem cell therapy is one of the great promises. The InCor laboratory has studied cells from different backgrounds as candidates for cell therapy in the context of myocardial infarction. Evidence in preclinical studies of the application of stromal (mesenchymal) adipose tissue (hASC) in the ischemic heart by both the InCor group (in the animal model in rodents and pigs) and others in the literature suggest relevant benefits on the decrease of deterioration post-infarction. More recently it has been demonstrated that it arises mainly from the formation of new vessels due to paracrine factors, which are secreted by the injected cells. There are currently no studies in Brazil in which the safety of injecting different doses of hASC cells into the heart has been particularly evaluated. Recently, two studies have demonstrated the clinical applicability of hASC in patients with peripheral ischemic disease and stroke.\n\nThus, the objective of this work will be to test the hypothesis that the implantation of autologous stromal cells derived from adipose tissue combined with myocardial revascularization surgery in patients with coronary artery disease"

There is no currently codified treatment for this type of situation and no therapeutic antifibrotic has been effective. Cell therapy is a promising new approach.After a liposuction and removing of mature adipocytes (40 to 60%), the remaining cells called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) could be isolated. SVF consists of a heterogeneous cell population including multipotent stem cells similar to mesenchymal stem cells present in bone marrow. The investigators hypothesis is that the trophic and antifibrotic properties of SVF could benefit patients with vocal cords scarring responsible for dysphonia."

                              "Gastro intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by somatic mutations in the gene encoding the KIT or the PDGFR alpha protein1. Treatment of localized forms relies on adequate surgery without tumor spillage and systemic treatment with imatinib according to risk of relapse defined by localization, tumor size and mitotic count, as well as mutational status. Advanced and relapsing forms are currently treated with oral tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) of KIT and PDGFR such as Imatinib, Sunitinib and Regorafenib. Over two decades significant changes in drug discovery have impacted treatment strategies, notably via patient's access to various clinical trials. The use of focal treatments such as surgery or interventional radiology with mini invasive procedure of oligometastasis is also being proposed in some cases.\n\nThere is no precise data on patterns of sequential treatments used, especially proportions of patients with metastatic GIST eventually benefiting from access to a clinical trial or a focal treatment strategy in the course of their disease, and their results in terms of survival on a real life national level.\n\nUsing the French sarcoma Group national database we aim at describing treatments strategies proposed patients with metastatic GIST in the real life setting.\n\nObjectives include : (i) Description of clinico-biological profiles, patterns of care and modalities of treatment of patients with metastatic GIST in a real-life national setting and (ii) evaluation of impact of each treatment line on patients outcome in terms of time to next treatment (TNT) and survival"

                              "Gastric stromal tumor is a gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumor with malignant differentiation potential, the incidence increased year by year. The surgical resection is the primary treatment for it. Although laparoscopic GIST resection has many benefits\uff0cdue to in lack of the delicate sense of touch, it could lead to the incomplete resection and disorders of digestion. More than 33% of postoperative patients have the gastric dysfunction. Laparoscopic endoscopy combined surgery is different from the past technology. It is a new radical resection of GIST presented by Japanese scholars. LECS resects the tumor completely by laparoscopy with the help of the precise positioning and guidance of endoscopy .This method conforms to the idea of the modern minimally invasive surgery, and avoids many problems\uff0csuch as incomplete resection and disorders of digestion caused by excessive tissue resection. our team will spearhead the GIST treatment of LECS. First of all, the investigators will collect 120 cases of GIST patients, randomly assigned for the laparoscopic group, the LECS, single-arch the LECS surgical treatment. Secondly, to analyzing the basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time, blood loss, the number of transfer laparotomy, the number of cut edge positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, the cases of anastomotic fistula bleeding, stenosis, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency, reflux esophagitis, bile reflux gastritis and other indicators.The purpose of this subject is to observe the effectivity and safety of LECS and single-arch the LECS, invent serval LECS equipment patents and provide some references for LECS applying to the minimally invasive surgery of the digestive tract tumor and multidisciplinary treatment mode ."

Due to mutations in KIT and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA) in 90% of patients with this mesenchymal tumor, many tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used. On the other hand, a resectable tumor is approached by surgery, endoscopic and ablation therapy.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) approach has been studied in hepatic GISTs, and hepatic metastases, but its evaluation in esophageal, gastric, and intestinal GISTs is scarce. This study aims to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided RFA using the 19 G RFA probe developed by Taewong Medical for the treatment of GISTs."

                              "GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 95% of GISTs are positive for KIT (CD117)-the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF). GISTs are not responsive to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and disease often recurs even after complete resection with wide margins.\n\nImatinib mesylate (trade names: Glivec\u00ae and Gleevec\u00ae, imatinib, formerly STI571) is a signal transduction inhibitor targeting several protein-tyrosine kinases that are believed to play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells. In the Phase II study of imatinib [CSTI571B 2222] in 147 patients with recurrent or metastatic GIST, the partial response rates were 67% and 66% in patients treated at 400 mg/d and 600 mg/d, respectively. Skin rash and elevated transaminases were the most common reason for drug discontinuation. The most frequently reported AEs were mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, superficial edema (primarily periorbital or lower limb), myalgia and muscle cramps. Grade 3/4 events included fluid retention (pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, and pulmonary edema), skin rash, liver toxicity and gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) was a consistent finding. Also, a tumor lysis-like syndrome occurred in some patients leading to gastrointestinal (GI) and/or intratumoral hemorrhage.\n\nIn a Phase 3, American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial (ACOSOG Z9001) of adjuvant imatinib, imatinib significantly improved 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with placebo.\n\nIn summary, clinical trials have shown that imatinib produces clinical benefit in most patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and extends median survival from 19 to 57 months. Imatinib is the standard of care for advanced GIST and has received regulatory approval for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST. Studies suggest that adjuvant imatinib for 1 year prolongs RFS in patients at high risk of recurrent disease and metastases following complete surgical resection of the primary GIST.\n\nImatinib is an appealing adjuvant therapy for resected GIST because:\n\nPatients with primary GIST have a high chance of tumor recurrence\nConventional adjuvant treatment modalities are ineffective\nImatinib specifically inhibits the Kit receptor which is constitutively activated in most GISTs\nImatinib inhibits the growth of Kit positive cells in vitro\nImatinib is highly effective in many patients with advanced GIST in a Phase II trial\nImatinib has been associated with minimal toxicity in patients with advanced GIST and in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\nImatinib may have its greatest impact on survival when there is minimal disease.\n\nPrimary\n\nTo assess Recurrence Free Survival Rate in patients with resected primary GIST who are treated with adjuvant imatinib for a duration of 2 years Secondary\nTo compare Recurrence Free Survival, Overall Survival, and Time to Recurrence of patients with resected primary GIST who are treated with adjuvant imatinib for a duration of 2 years with historical data To assess the safety of imatinib given as adjuvant therapy for 2 years in patients with resected primary GIST"

                              "Vocal Folds scarring (whether congenitally or following phonosurgery) can result in a range of symptoms depending on severity and extent, such as hoarseness, breathy voice, increased effort to speak, and voice fatigue. The inability to phonate normally causes both physical and psychological disability, especially for professional communicators (teachers, tradesmen, singers, etc.). There are several therapies currently available but these are often disappointing, as the great complexity of vocal fold microstructure hinders the development of effective therapy. Thus, identification of innovative strategies able to improve vibrational mechanical properties of vocal folds remains an important clinical challenge.\n\nAutologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) is recognized as an easily accessible source of cells displaying angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. Recent experimental and clinical reports also supported the anti-fibrotic potential of ADVSF, mainly attributed to the mesenchymal stem/stromal cell subset.\n\nSafety in humans has already been confirmed in several studies, including our previous clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT0262246; EudraCT number: 2015-000238-31). The main objective of this phase I/II trial was to measure for the first time the safety and tolerability of autologous ADSVF local injections in patients with scarred vocal folds. No severe adverse events occurred: only some minor adverse events were reported. Moreover, Voice Handicap Index was improved in all patients with a mean improvement from baseline of 40.1/120 and seven patients were considered as responders, defined as an improvement \u2265 18 points.\n\nBased on these observations, we hypothesized that the injection of autologous ADSVF could reduce the process of fibrosis, improve vibration and then dysphonia and quality of life in patients with scarred vocal folds.\n\nIn the absence of a reference treatment, the effectiveness of the ADSVF will be compared to a placebo: the local injection of excipients solution.\n\nThis study will test efficacy of the autologous ADSVF to treat vocal folds scarring. It is a randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical trial conducted according to a 2-treatment parallel design, with medico-surgical and scientific collaboration.\n\nRecruitment and follow-up of patients will be done in 4 university hospitals by the respective ENT teams (Marseille, Toulouse, Nice and Montpellier): 36 patients will be recruited and treated on a 24 months period.\n\nAt inclusion, 36 patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into two groups: ADSVF group and placebo group. Adipose tissue removal, ADSVF production and injection of ADSVF or placebo will be done on the same day during a short hospital stay. Patients will be followed and evaluated at 1 and 6 months with self-evaluation (Voice Handicap Index and a 10 points scale), video-laryngo-stroboscopic examination, vocal assessment with perceptive, acoustic and aerodynamic parameters and evaluation of adverse events. At the end of this 6-month follow-up (primary endpoint), patients without improvement will be offered an injection of thawed and washed ADSVF. Patients will continue to be followed in open-label on the same endpoints."

But completely removing a GIST tumor with surgery is often not possible. Researchers want to see if a new drug, selumetinib, can help treat these tumors.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find out if selumetinib shrinks or slows the growth of GIST tumors and to see its side effects.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 3 and over who have one or more GIST tumors and may have neurofibromatosis type I (also called NF1). Their NF1 GIST has shown some growth or cannot be completely removed with surgery.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with heart and eye tests and scans.\n\nParticipants will be told what foods and medicines they cannot take during the study. Participants will keep a diary of the medicine they take during the study.\n\nParticipants will take selumetinib capsules twice daily on an empty stomach for 28 days in a row. This is 1 cycle.\n\nDuring the cycles, participants will have study visits. These may include:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nHeart tests\n\nScans of their tumors\n\nEye exam\n\nPositron emission tomography scan. They will be get radioactive glucose an IV line. They will lie quietly in a darkened room for 50-60 minutes then have the scan.\n\nParticipants will answer questions about how they are feeling.\n\nParticipants can stay in the study until they have bad side effects or their tumor grows.\n\nAfter finishing treatment, participants will be watched for side effects for 30 days."

                              "Background:\n\n- Bone marrow stromal stem cells (also known as mesenchymal stem cells) have been isolated and are found to make large amounts of growth factors. Because they make growth factors, these cells can help re-grow tissue and encourage repair of damaged tissue. Tests on damaged heart muscle suggest that injecting these cells directly into damaged heart muscle can improve heart function. Researchers want to give stem cells to people who are having open heart surgery to see if they can help to repair heart muscle damage.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow stromal stem cell injections given during heart surgery to treat heart muscle damage.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have open heart surgery for heart artery or vein blockages.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.\nParticipants will have bone marrow taken from both hip bones about 3 weeks before the heart surgery.\nDuring the surgery, the stromal stem cells collected from the bone marrow will be given into the damaged portion of the heart muscle. The rest of the heart surgery will be performed according to standard procedures.\nAfter the surgery, participants will be monitored for complications from the stromal stem cells.\nParticipants will have heart function tests to see if the stromal stem cell treatments were effective...."

                              "Failure rates of up to 30% are reported after proximal humeral fractures despite angular-stable devices. This may devastate not only the functional outcome but also the independence of elderly patients.\n\nTo increase bone mineral density and thereby holding-strength augmentation is an option. Autologous bone-graft, as current gold-standard, though is questionable in osteoporosis since osteoprogenitors are dysfunctional and the harvesting-morbidity considerable. Adipose tissue seems an alternative cell-source even in presence of osteoporosis.\n\nStromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from lipoaspirates display osteogenic and vasculogenic potential and can be harvested in high numbers. Expansion associated with costly good-manufacturers-practice facilities is avoidable, so are repeated interventions. These cells have been successfully used to generate osteogenic composite grafts with intrinsic vascularity in preclinical models.\n\nFor translation into clinical practice after a 20 patient external pilot a prospective randomized controlled trial with 270 patients is planned. For the trial lipoaspiration precedes open reduction and internal fixation in individuals over 60 years presenting with a proximal humeral fracture after low-energy trauma. Cells are isolated (Cellution\u00ae800/CRS) and wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules after embedding in a fibrin-gel for augmentation of the typical bone-void. Clinical/radiological follow-up is at 6 and 12 weeks for immediate complications and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Functional assessment is performed after 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months using the Quick-Dash- and Constant-Score.\n\nThe primary outcome is a reduction in secondary dislocation by 50% during the first postoperative year. Secondary dislocation is diagnosed on plain radiographs by an independent board certified radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal imaging if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\nMore than 20\u00b0 varus collapse of the humeral head fragment in relation to the humeral shaft\nScrew penetration through the humeral head"

                              "The exact incidence of subepithelial tumors (SETs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is unknown, but the prevalence of gastric SETs detected during routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy is 0.36%. GI SETs may include leiomyoma, GI stromal tumor (GIST), schwannoma, lipoma, cyst, or ectopic pancreas. Surgical resection is the principal diagnostic and therapeutic method for SETs, especially for large and symptomatic ones. Preoperative pathological diagnosis of SETs may facilitate clinical decision making, but conventional endoscopic forceps biopsy does not yield adequate amounts of subepithelial tissue for definitive diagnosis.\n\nAlthough endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best imaging modality for the evaluation of SETs, it cannot substitute histopathological diagnosis. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may provide adequate amounts of tissue for the diagnosis of SETs, but it does not always afford adequate samples for immunohistochemical analysis because of the often small number of cells obtained by aspiration. Since some SETs, especially GI mesenchymal tumors such as GIST or schwannoma, have varied morphologic appearances, and diagnosis using a small biopsy is not straightforward, immunohistochemical analysis is strongly advisable, if not essential. EUS-guided Trucut biopsy (EUS-TNB) may overcome the limitations of EUS-FNA in procuring sufficient core tissue specimens. Although EUS-TNB is more accurate than EUS-FNA for diagnosing GI mesenchymal tumors, the rigidity of its 19-gauge (G) caliber and the mechanical friction of the firing mechanism produced by the torqued echoendoscope limit its use for SETs located in the gastric antrum and duodenum. Therefore, a needle facilitating adequate histological core sampling with easy maneuverability needs to be established. A 19G EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) device with ProCore reverse-bevel technology was recently introduced. A multicenter study revealed that histological samples could be successfully obtained using this needle in most patients having GI SETs, with a diagnostic accuracy of >80%.10 However, because of technical difficulties with this needle in the gastric antrum and duodenum, the same FNB device was recently developed in a 20 G platform with coiled sheath. This prospective, multicenter study aimed to evaluate feasibility, yield, and diagnostic accuracy of a newly developed 20 G ProCore needle with coiled sheath in patients with GI SETs."
