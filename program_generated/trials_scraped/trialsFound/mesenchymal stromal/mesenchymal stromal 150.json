There are not enough cartilage cells to fill the defect so cartilage cells need to be mixed with MSCs. MSCs or Mesenchymal Stem Cells are naturally occurring cells that provide growth factors and cell signals that play a role in tissue repair. MSCs can be found in bone marrow and in the fatty tissues (i.e., area under the skin of the belly or breast) of patients. Fibrin glue is a product made from the naturally occurring compounds in blood which cause clotting. This glue hardens into a gel-like substance into which cells such as cartilage cells (chondrons) and AMSCs can be placed."

The first dose of cells to be given will be 1x10^6 MSC/kg and the second dose of cells will be 5x10^6 MSC/kg.

MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood and adipose tissue, and cultured in specific media. MSC colony formation, which is known as marrow-like stromal cells and MPCs, is similar to fibroblast colony forming unit (CFU-F) in in vitro condition. According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), MSCs can be easily detected or identified from other cells using flow cytometric analysis to detect specific surface markers"

EUS guided RFA will be performed using the 19G electrode ablation needle connected to the Starmed radiofrequency generator (Taewong Medical, Seoul, South Korea). After EUS identification of the GIST, a place without interposing vessels will be found by the endosonographer. Puncture of the tumor will be performed directly with the ablation probe inserted through the working channel of the echoendoscope. Time - seconds will depend by the tumor dimension, localization, distance from vital structures (e.g., aorta) and EUS appearance (e.g., hyperechoic). Power will be set at no more than 30W. If the tumor is in contact with vital structures a 10mm safe margin will be kept from these to avoid thermal injury. Multiple applications can be performed in the same or separate session depending on the residual tumor tissue evaluated with DFI-EUSor CE-EUS immediately after procedure."
