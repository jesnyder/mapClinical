                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, long-term allograft survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade.\n\nA promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use without the delay required for expansion.\n\nAlthough it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged, they could possibly elicit an anti-donor immune response, which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and impact the allograft survival on the long term. These safety issues should be studied before further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting.\n\nMSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at increased risk for developing immune mediated injury. In addition, a large amount of the kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis which so importantly affects long term survival. MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term survival of transplanted kidneys has not improved accordingly in the last decades. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for many years, due to their efficacy in preventing acute rejection. However, CNI have nephrotoxic side effects that can directly contribute to renal dysfunction and compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently there is a strong interest in immunosuppressive (IS) regimens that maintain efficacy for the prevention of acute rejection, whilst reducing nephrotoxicity.\n\nIn this perspective the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with a mTor inhibitor (Everolimus (Certican\u00ae)) might be an optimal strategy to facilitate CNI (tacrolimus) withdrawal. MSCs have IS properties and roles in tissue repair and everolimus is a proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects. In experimental studies the combination of mTor inhibitor and MSCs was shown to attenuate alloimmune responses and to promote allograft tolerance.\n\nIn total 70 de novo renal recipients, 18-75 years of ages will be recruited from the transplant clinics of the LUMC. Thirty five of these patients will be included in the Certican/ and MSC group and 35 patients in the Certican/ standard dose tacrolimus group. Patients of the MSC treated groups will receive two doses of autologous BM derived MSCs IV, 7 days apart, 6 and 7 weeks after transplantation in combination with Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.). At the time of the second MSC infusion tacrolimus will be withdrawn in 2 weeks (after 1 week dose of tacrolimus will be halved, after 2 weeks stopped). Patients in the control group will receive Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.) and standard dose tacrolimus (through levels 6-8 ng/ml after 6 weeks).\n\nPrimary goal is evaluate whether concentration-controlled Certican\u00ae with MSCs compared to Certican\u00ae with standard tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients reduces fibrosis by quantitative Sirius Red scoring."

The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.\n\nAbdominal fat will be harvested through a small incision and processed by the Mayo Clinic IMPACT laboratory using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and previously established standard operating procedures (SOPs) to produce clinical grade, autologous, culture-expanded AD-MSCs for subsequent intradiscal injection. All injections will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis. A final visit for evaluation and imaging will be conducted at the end of the study."

The investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation. The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae, Astellas Pharma), and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will receive basiliximab (Simulect\u00ae, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.\n\nUp to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30 days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a 2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90 days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.\n\nThe study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials."

                              "-Chemo-radiation enhances survival but also increases the risk of PRD. The result will be an increasing\n\nCost for society (repeated hospitalization for palliative care)\nAn ethical problem to help these patients with irreversible degraded quality of life.\n\nResults from conventional therapies for PRD reveal a poor long-term efficacy:\n\ni. Coagulation by plasma argon is insufficient, 58% at 6 months; ii. The efficacy of formalin is questionable (48%), as is 5-amino-salicylate, sulfasalazine, vitamin E and pentoxifylline ; iii. The efficacy of short chain fatty acids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is low (40%); iv. Steroids are of limited efficacy (37%). v. A surgical operation in an irradiated field is associated with difficult or impossible healing as well as with risks of infection (mortality of 5% within 40 months) Furthermore, conventional therapies are palliative and badly tolerated. More effective approaches are thus crucial.\n\nPRD unfortunately remains a major side effect of radiotherapy and there is no established effective treatment. Consequently, the recruitment of the aforementioned number of patients by participating radiotherapy centers is ensured.\n\nMSC therapy is a safe and suitable option in severe PRD.\n\nThe investigators propose a proof of concept.\nMSC production and injection protocol has already been successfully employed in compassionate therapy on four patients, who suffered from chronic and fistulizing colitis, after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.\n\nPRISME is a network project which includes St Antoine Hospital, INSERM (National Institute of Health and Medical Research), EFS (French Blood Establishment ), CTSA (Army Centre of Blood Transfusion) ECellFrance, IRSN (Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety), IGR (Gustave Roussy Institute), and Institute of cancerology of west France. Our consortium has robust experience of the treatment of radiation damages, preclinical models and the medical management of PRD using biotherapy. Clinical and scientific achievements, previous collaborations of the different groups and preliminary partner's data assure the fulfillment of the program.\n\nPatient selection will be performed by the six radiotherapy centers participating in this study. The expected recruitment per center had been concluded from the average number of potentially eligible patients treated and surveyed in each of the following centers (St Antoine Hospital, Gustave Roussy Institute, Institute of cancerology of west France).\nThe ECellFrance platform will ensure MSC production. This platform includes two locations in Parisian region: EFS (in the city of Creteil) and CTSA.\nSupport, trials and intervention protocols will be handled in the Department of Clinical Hematology at St Antoine Hospital, renowned for its expertise in the treatment of overdosed radiation therapy patients, i.e. Epinal cases) and which has managed a PHRC using MSCs.\nParticipation of a research group with robust experience in stem cells, transplantation (Research centre Saint Antoine, INSERM) and radiobiology, cell therapy treatment of radiation accidents (IRSN, CTSA). These groups will carry out the characterization of the biological activity and immunological properties of the native MSC bone marrow tissue in vitro (INSERM) and in vivo (IRSN) and immunological monitoring of patients treated with the MSC (INSERM).\n\nIt is expected to achieve the healing of chronic refractory diseases, leading to lower health expenses by reducing patient treatment and hospitalization, and to an increase in their quality of life by a:\n\nDecrease in rectorrhagia and hematuria, pain, drug-consumption;\nInhibition of hemorrhagic syndromes and chronic inflammation accompanied by a sustained fistulization arrest due to the repairing capability of MSC.\n\nThe expected results for the public will be the healing of chronic refractory diseases, leading to lower health expenses by reducing patient treatment and hospitalization, and to an increase in their quality of life.\n\nHypothesis: MSC injections provide an efficient alternative approach in the treatment of PRD for patient refractories to conventional treatments.\n\nPatient study scheduled:\n\nD-60: Screening by 6 radiotherapy centers. D-1: Inclusion in Saint Antoine Hospital. D0, D7 and D14: IV MSC injection (2x106 - 6x106/kg MSC). M2 and M4: follow-up visit. End of patient's participation to the study at M4. Total number of scheduled patients: 12 patients suffering from PRD. Simon minimax plan, P0=25%, P1=60%, Alpha=5% and Beta=20%.\n\nStopping rules:\n\nStep 1: (n1=5) inclusion of 5 patients r1=1: if the number of success is <2, the study will end for MSC inefficacy. If the number of success is \u22652, proceed to step 2. Step 2: (n2=7) inclusion of up to 7 patients r2=5: as soon as the number of successes reaches 6 (>r2), inclusions will be discontinued and MSC will be considered as sufficiently promising for further studies."

The Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far, the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators' pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion criteria."

Three doses will be administered unless a severe infusion adverse event occurs that is related to the MSC infusion.

                              "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal malignancies that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, progressive bone marrow failure, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, and increased risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is a well-accepted theory that MDS and AML originate from primary alterations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) compartment, which confer a survival advantage to them at the expense of physiological hematopoiesis. More recently, there is growing evidences regarding the contribution of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment to the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. Of particular interest, several studies have pointed towards a pivotal role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), one of the main components of the BM niche, in the initiation and propagation of myeloid disorders. In this context, it is of clinical significance to better characterize the intrinsic defects harbored by MSC in MDS and AML context, as compared to physiological conditions. Such research initiative aims to dissect the cross-talk between malignant HSC and their BM partners in crime, further prospecting for innovative stromal-directed strategies for the treatment of MDS and AML."

While the clinical presentation varies, affected patients are typically previously healthy individuals who are less than 21 years of age. The diagnostic criteria include fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and multisystem involvement requiring hospitalization. Up to 75% of patients present with an element of cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, with some also requiring intubation with mechanical ventilation. Reported supportive treatments have included intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and aspirin. In the limited cases reported, up to 50% of children with MIS-C have antibodies to COVID-19 in their blood and may or may not be PCR positive on a nasal swab or throat culture. The disease is incompletely understood but currently believed, at least in part, to be a hyper-immune response to a recent COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, MSCs have been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and decrease production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, up to 70% of infused cells are engulfed by lung macrophages, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules by these macrophages. These observations have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may work through both anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and regenerative mechanisms.\n\nOver the past several months, MSCs have been tested in small cohorts of adult patients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to determine if the cytokine storm hypothesized to cause this complication could be suppressed by MSCs. Early results are encouraging, and formal clinical trials are underway. Extending this work into the pediatric population, the hypothesis of this study is that infusion of hCT-MSC can reverse the pro-inflammatory state in children with MIS-C.\n\nThis is a 6 patient, multisite, pilot study to test whether infusions of hCT-MSC are safe in pediatric patients with MIS-C. Information will also be gathered about the duration and severity of the participant's multisystem inflammatory syndrome. hCT-MSCs will be manufactured at Duke University Medical Center in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and shipped frozen to the treatment site, where they will remain stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until the day of dosing.\n\nThe baseline evaluation will include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate), echocardiogram, ECG or telemetry strip, HLA typing, Panel Reactive Antibody (anti-HLA antibody), inflammatory markers, blood counts, blood chemistry, coagulation, and COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests.Patients will be dosed with 2x10^6 hCT-MSCs/kg. Doses will be given on days 1, 2, 3, and a fourth, optional dose may be given on day 7 at the discretion of the investigator and the treating physician. Prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Hydrocortisone, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes via a syringe pump. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluids will be managed by the care team. Afterwards, the participant will continue to be monitored in their care setting per institutional standards. Participants will be evaluated by study staff the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications.\n\nThe participant will be monitored by study staff to assess for any infusion related adverse reactions or complications until discharge. Additional follow-up will occur on days 14, 28, and 90. Follow up testing will include assessment for adverse events as well as the tests done at baseline (with the exception of HLA typing and COVID PCR."

The dose-escalation methods with a modified continual reassessment at the five dose levels (1x10^6, 10x10^6, 20x10^6, 40x10^6, 80x10^6, cells/kg) will be performed to determine safety and feasibility of allogeneic BM-MSC infusion during pediatric cardiac surgery and the maximum tolerated dose in infants with CHD. In addition to the primary objective of assessing the safety and feasibility of BM-MSC delivery through CPB, our secondary objectives are designed to develop biological signature measures and clinical outcome measures feasible for use in larger efficacy and effectiveness trials with a particular focus on neurodevelopmental outcome and early postoperative course after BM-MSC treatment. We will determine actual magnitude of differences in neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental variables and postoperative inflammatory and pathophysiological variables after BM-MSC delivery in infants with CHD. Enrollment, follow-up, and analysis are planned to occur over 36 months for the treatment and initial follow-up portions of the study. Long-term follow-up until 18 months of age will be subsequently reported."

                              "Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (uc-MSC).\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design."

                              "Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19), caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which occurs as a growing pandemic in early 2020 and currently represents an emergency state worldwide. Several reports have shown that the first step in the pathogenesis of Sars-Cov-2 is the recognition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor by the virus. This ACE2 receptor is widely distributed on the surface of human cells, especially as type II alveolar cells and capillary endothelium, however bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen are known as immune cells, such as T and lymphocytes. B and macrophages, are negatives to ACE2. These results suggest that immunotherapy can be used to treat infected patients. However, an immunomodulatory capacity cannot be so strong, if just one or two major immunological factors used, as the virus can cause a \"cytokine storm\", such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10 , MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\u03b1, followed by edema, gas exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury and secondary infection that can lead to death. Therefore, avoiding a \"cytokine storm\" may be the key to treating patients infected with Sars-Cov-2. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for immunomodulatory activity, can have beneficial effects in preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm. Because MSCs have been widely used in cell therapy, from basic research to clinical trials. Safety and efficacy have been clearly documented in several clinical trials, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). The objective of the study is to verify the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with SARS-CoV-2."

                              "Septic shock is one of the most common and devastating health problems in the intensive care unit, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% and a staggering economic burden of approximately 4 billion dollars annually in Canada. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders, hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy in this vulnerable population."

                              "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established therapeutic modality for high risk hematological malignancies in adults and children. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality after HCT is graft versus host disease (GVHD), affecting up to 70% of patients even with current prophylaxis and directly accounting for approximately a third of regimen-related death. Currently, pharmacologic prophylaxis consists of a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate, a drug combination introduced around 40 years ago. Despite this regimen being recognized as the standard of care, it is only partially effective, increases the risk of infection and disease relapse and imparts drug-related, short- and long-term adverse effects. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potent immune modulatory activity which is markedly enhanced by exposure to interferon \u03b3. In murine models, interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) primed MSCs (\u03b3MSCs) potently suppress GVHD without untoward adverse effects suggesting this cell therapy may markedly reduce the regimen related toxicity of HCT; however \u03b3MSCs have never been infused into patients.\n\nThis protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that freshly expanded \u03b3MSCs can be reliably produced and safely infused into patients undergoing HCT as GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nThis is an investigator-initiated Phase I study using a rolling 6, dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual to the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined in adults. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for a future Phase II study to demonstrate efficacy and support a Phase III randomized trial.\n\nThe researchers plan to enroll a minimum of 4 and maximum of 45 subjects who are greater than 1 year old. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after the HCT. The study will be conducted at Emory University and will recruit participants from the Winship Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital in Atlanta at Egleston."

                              "Background: Cranial bone defects are often left following brain surgery, usually to allow swelling of the brain to recover before subsequently re-implanting a protective covering of the brain at a later time (cranioplasty). These procedures are performed anywhere over the cranial vault, either unilaterally or bilaterally. The original piece of bone (autologous bone plate = bone flap) is placed in a sterile container and stored in a refrigerator at temperature of -40oC.\n\nWeeks or months later, when the brain is relaxed, the scalp well healed and the patient's medical condition permits, the individual is taken back to the operating room and the bone is reimplanted (A procedure known as an autologous cranioplasty). The aim of the procedure is to restore cosmesis and protection to the underlying brain and it can sometimes also improve neurological symptoms by unknown mechanisms. Unfortunately these aims are not always achieved and whilst technically straightforward the procedure is known to be associated with a number of complications. Two of the most significant of these are infection (such that the bone flap needs to be removed and replaced) and resorption (such that the protective function is compromised). Overall 10% of autologous bone patients become infected, 10% require replacement due to resorption and 12% become significantly resorbed, then in 32% of case the autologous bone has failed.\n\nIn each case of cranioplasty failure the patient requires readmission, a second operation to remove the bone flap, prolonged antibiotic therapy (in the case of infection), and then a new custom-made plate and readmission for a third surgical procedure.\n\nIn most cases synthetic materials such as polymethylmethacrylate and titanium mesh are used for reconstruction. Commonly reconstruction is carried out by the surgeon using such materials to sculpt the cranioplasty. More recently, hydro formed titanium plates have been used. This entails a process of CT scanning the defect, virtual reconstruction, 3D printing of moulds, pressing the plate and hand finishing. Whilst highly successful in treating more than 150 patients, the titanium cranioplasty remains in the patient for life and, as a non-biological material, presents as a preferential site for infection (approximately 5% of cases). In addition, medical CT images for assessment and treatment of neurological conditions are compromised for life due to metal artefacts arising from the plates. Furthermore, interference with metal scanning equipment commonly used for security purposes also remains a life time issue. The patients with an infected titanium cranioplasty require a fourth admission to remove the metal or polymer plate, extended antibiotic treatment and then a fifth surgical procedure to reinsert a new cranioplasty.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC): MSC are multipotent adult cells capable of differentiating down multiple mesenchymal lineages. They are adherent fibroblastoid-like cells with an extensive capacity for expansion. They reside within the connective tissue of most organs and have been isolated from bone marrow, placenta, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, amniotic fluid, circulating blood, various foetal tissues, skeletal muscle synovia, dental pulp, liver, spleen, lung and dermis. Most work has focussed on MSC derived from bone marrow, however, there are also some clinical reports using adipose tissue and placental derived MSC. MSC from different sources may not be functionally equivalent or exhibit the same differentiation potential. The main functions for bone marrow derived MSC with regards to the present study is the ability to differentiate down the osteogenic lineage. It is this ability to differentiate that has seen them applied to bony non-union and the treatment of critical size bone skeletal deficits, and in particular the reconstruction of cranial voids. In the current proposal Cell and Tissue Therapies W.A. at Royal Perth Hospital have extensive experience and have applied for an TGA (Therapeutics Goods Administration, the Australian Government regulatory authority) licence to manufacture and provide MSC for patient treatment.\n\nMSC are not immunogenic and escape recognition by alloreactive T cells and NK cells. They have low level expression of HLA class I and no expression of HLA class II. They do not express co-stimulatory molecules and are unable to induce T cell mediated immune response, and therefore can be used as universal donor cells. Allogeneic cells have been widely used in clinical trials in both immune modulation and tissue repair. The advantage of using allogeneic cells is that donor age can be controlled. The literature indicates that MSC harvested from donors older than 40 years are inferior. Since many of the patients being treated with a cranioplasty are greater than 40 years of age, the use of allogeneic cells in this study is preferable. Clinical human trials and animal studies support the use of allogeneic cells.\n\nCranioplasty: The Department of Medical Engineering and Physics at Royal Perth Hospital is a world leader in providing custom made implants and has been supplying custom made titanium cranioplasties for fifteen years. The basic methodology which has been used to treat over 150 patients includes the reconstruction of the void using advanced software based on the patients CT scan. Once the void has been reconstructed a female mould is created to press the titanium plate. The plate is then hand finished and checked for fitment on a premade defect model.\n\nBioceramic: Resorbable bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite and beta tri-calcium phosphate have been used in the treatment of bony deficit for many years. For example, ChronOS (Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf) bone graft substitute is a fully synthetic and resorbable bone graft substitute consisting of beta-tricalcium phosphate with a compressive strength similar to that of cancellous bone. The interconnected porosity acts as an osteconductive matrix for the ingrowth of bone cells and blood vessels. Such materials are used for filling of bone defects after trauma, reconstruction or correction in non-load bearing indications and commonly these materials prescribe a method of perfusion of the granules in the operating room with the patient's own bone marrow. Resorption of the bioceramics has been shown to occur over a period of 6-18 months (Buser 1998).\n\nPolymer Scaffold: There are a myriad of polymer materials used for surgery including in the area of cranio-maxillofacial surgery. The most common polymer is poly(lactic acid). PLA such as 70:30 poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) are made from a amorphous biodegradable copolymer which will ultimately resorb in vivo. The bioceramics and polymer materials are approved by the TGA for this indication."

                              "Asthma affects one out of every 10 patients in the United States. Many of these patients have poor asthma symptom control. For example, patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma have ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite aggressive treatment with asthma medications. These patients are at increased risk for medication-related side effects and potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Novel therapies are critically needed for this population.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that reside in the bone marrow. MSCs are anti-inflammatory and also promote body tissue repair. This study will determine whether one form of MSCs called \"interferon gamma-primed MSCs or \u03b3MSCs\" are safe for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.\n\nPatients will receive a single intravenous infusion of \u03b3MSCs at either 2x10^6 cells/kg or 5x10^6 cells/kg. Up to 12 young adults will be enrolled. The total sample size will not exceed 24 participants.\n\nThe study will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (for patient activities) and at Emory University (for laboratory research activities). Participants will be identified from the asthma clinics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Participants will complete up to 12 visits over 1 year and will be compensated for their time and travel. At the completion of the study, any samples remaining after experimentation will be de-identified and made available for future research.\n\nWhile some study participants may receive no direct benefit from participating in this study, others may benefit from the close monitoring of their respiratory health, specialized asthma education, and general evaluation of their condition, including lung function tests. Some participants also achieve psychological benefit from participating in an important research study and from interaction with the study staff. It is also possible that the knowledge obtained from this study, such as identification of biomarkers, may assist in the creation of novel asthma therapies in the future."

It will evaluate this by looking at whether there are treatment related infusion reactions, and assessing linear growth rates and bone health, both of which are impaired in patients ages 3-10 with Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 3. This is a single-site non-randomized clinical trial, that will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) at Egleston and Emory Children's Center.\n\nMSCs will be infused through IV every 4 months for 6 total infusions. There will be a baseline visit before MSC therapy is initiated, and there will be a follow up visits every 4 months for 1 year after the final MSC infusion. These infusions will take place in between pamidronate infusions (i.e. 2 months after the last pamidronate infusion, and 2 months before the next one). Pamidronate aids in treatment of bone pain and bone mineral density but does not correct the underlying defect nor does it show substantial improvements in linear growth.\n\nAfter the MSC infusions, patients will be provided an overnight at Ronald McDonald House, or a hospital affiliated hotel so they can be near to the hospital in case of any unanticipated effects, and for a follow up visit the next morning.\n\nLabs will be collected during every visit to look at bone metabolism. Limb and bone age x-rays, pQCT scans, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will be completed annually, while spine films will be completed every 18 months. These images will directly examine bone health. Body measurements will be taken every visit as well to assess linear growth. The patients' parents will complete events diaries and submit them each infusion day to evaluate fractures that occurred between visits. Patients and their parents will also complete quality of life surveys once a year.\n\nThere will be financial compensation for each study visit. Subjects will also be provided a free lunch on days when radiology visits occur and will be reimbursed for parking.\n\nSubjects will be identified and recruited mainly through Children's endocrinology clinic. There will also be advertisements to the OI foundation, and neighboring pediatric hospitals with OI programs such as University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt. If identified as eligible to participate, the study team will seek approval by the subjects' primary endocrinologist. The consent process will then take place in person during a baseline visit.\n\nThere is an optional part of the study that involves donation of a bone fragment that is taken out during a routine surgical rodding procedure. This piece of bone is removed and discarded, if it is not donated, making it minimal risk. Bone sample donation will be available to OI Type 3 subjects receiving MSCs, and to OI Type 3 subjects who are not receiving MSCs but want to participate in research.\n\nLeftover blood samples, and bone fragments may be stored for future research by the sponsor of this study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to help doctors and scientists learn if serial MSC infusions will safely and effectively aid in growth, bone health, and ultimately improve motoric function and quality of life in this population."

                              "Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has spread quickly from Wuhan China to worldwide. On 15 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1.914.916 confirmed cases and 123.010 deaths globally, being a severe threat to public health.\n\nSome patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure. Several reports demonstrated that COVID-19 specifically recognized the angiotensin I converting ezyme 2 repector (ACE2) and ACE2-positive cells are infected by the virus. ACE2 receptor is widely present on the human cells surface such as alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelium, among others. COVID-19 infects cells and stimulates a terrible cytokine storm in the lung followed by edema, dysfunction of the air exchange and acute respiratory distress which may lead to death. Further, once COVID-19 enters in blood circulation, it can easy spread to some systems and organs, causing significant damage. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to believe that the inhibition of inflammatory response is the key to treat COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. Some studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 virus, reducing proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells into the lungs.\n\nThese immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the Phase I/II, double-blind (neither the participant nor the investigator will know if active drug or placebo is assigned), placebo-controlled, randomized (assigned by chance), in which subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia shall be received either MSCs (1 million cells/kg) or placebo by intravenous injection. The administration of cells will be done only once."

                              "To date, there is no effective therapy to cure multiple sclerosis (MS). Immunomodulatory therapies are useful in reducing the frequency of inflammatory processes (relapses) but don't delay significantly the progression of the disease, prevent long term disability or induce the repair of damaged tissue. This proposal contemplates the use of adult autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat patients with active MS. This is a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial in which 8 patients with active forms of MS and moderate disability will enter the trial with the primary objective of assessing the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of BM-MSC. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by gadolinium enhancing lesions though magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological effects and immunological effects. Once randomized, patients will undergo BM extraction and once confirmed the availability of the needed dose, they will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms (BM-MSC named XCEL-MC-ALPHA, or placebo). XCEL-MC-ALPHA will be cryopreserved for all patients regardless the allocated arm. At month 6, the treatment will be crossed. Patients will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years."

The remaining 50% of patients have non-responding recoveries that leads to amputation of the compromised limbs. Currently, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in animal models or in small groups of patients with diabetic foot ulcer has shown to be safe and effective. Particularly, the use of these cells induce regeneration, both in the dermis and the epidermis. Nevertheless, MSC transplantation has some limitations, for instance, time restrictions in the availability of cells due to their isolation and expansion as well as the complex and costly large-scale production. In the same manner, the cryopreservation might cause deleterious effects that affect the biological activity of the cells and a medical professional should conduct the cell administration. In addition, different studies report variability in the results due to the inconsistency in the methods that they used (extraction protocols, cultivation, expansion and administration). The investigators' recent studies in mice with skin lesions, particularly type 1 diabetes, have shown that the presence of the cells is not necessary to promote skin regeneration and the administration of dac-MSCs is sufficient to stimulate would healing."

                              "Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Since 25 years, patients with moderate to severe emphysema are treated with inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Currently, consensus is developing that this anti-inflammatory treatment is not effective to halt progression of emphysema. Therefore, emphysema may be classified as steroid-resistant and requires new anti-inflammatory treatment approaches, including cellbased therapies. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response in various diseases, including steroid-resistant transplant rejection, Crohn's disease and possibly emphysema as indicated by our pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .\n\nObjective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.\n\nStudy design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.\n\nStudy population: patients between age 45 and 65; a gradient of emphysema severity towards the lung apex as assessed by CT-derived lung densitometry and equally distributed between left and right lung; FEV1 between 20% and 45% pred; Gas diffusion capacity between 30% and 45% pred. Intervention (if applicable): MSC infusions with cryo-preserved MSC in a dose of 2 x 106 /kg body weight in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg ( at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) in a covered bag or NaCl 0.9% with 5% DMSO in a covered bag, both produced in the GMP facility of LUMC.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: LVRS is a routine procedure for treatment of emphysema and received a positive recommendation from the Cochrane Institute. The dose of MSC has been infused in over 200 patients in LUMC only causing mild side effects like fever and headache, mostly related to DMSO, which is present as a cryoprotectant in the verum. Placebo may also cause fever and headache (DMSO). For the study, additional physical exams will be performed 6 monthly for a period of 3 years after LVRS2 and additional blood sampling specific for the study protocol will be 50ml in total. A heparinized blood sample of 10 ml per sample will be taken: 1) just before the 1st LVRS while patient is under general anaesthesia, 2) just before the 1st MSC iv, 3) just before the 2nd MSC iv, 4) just before the 2nd LVRS while the patient is under general anaesthesia. Discomfort for the patient caused by the experimental treatment will be minimal while there is no reason to assume that hospital admission for the surgery will be prolonged by the cell therapy or placebo. The risks associated with the investigational treatment are low as the reported adverse events in Toetsing Online from previous MSC studies in LUMC show only mild to moderate severity. The risk-benefit analysis is low."

                              "Study Rationale Emphysema is one of the two main components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes over many years to airway obstruction by the loss of elastic recoil around the smallest airways. Emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking and it is widely accepted that the disease is caused by excessive proteolytic activity by proteases and a chronic inflammatory process, characterized by a cellular influx consisting of macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. This inflammatory response is steroid resistant and leads to slow but persistent alveolar destruction, resulting in enlarged lungs with bullous parts in both lungs. In addition to a central role of innate immunity, recent studies suggest that also (auto)antigen specific immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\nCurrently, the only treatment available for severe emphysema is lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to remove the most destroyed parts of the lungs. The surgery is generally performed in two separate sessions with a 10-12 weeks interval, with each lung as a separate surgical target. This surgical treatment allows improved ventilation in the remaining less affected areas of the lungs as demonstrated by post-surgical clinical improvement of lung function and increased survival in a subgroup of patients. Delayed wound healing after LVRS is an important clinical problem. It may lead to prolonged hospital stay due to air leakage from the lungs into the thoracic cavity. Lung emphysema patients are at high risk for prolonged air leakage after this surgery, which is most likely explained by the inflammatory process related to the disease.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into several cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. In recent years it has become evident that bone-marrow derived MSC (BM-MSC) have potent immunomodulatory effects on T and B cells and in animal models of chronic inflammation in vivo. In addition, it has been shown that MSC express or release a variety of soluble factors implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling and cell growth. Importantly, encouraging results have recently been obtained with the treatment of severe steroid resistant Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) with donor (allogeneic) BM-MSC. Furthermore, in our institute autologous BM-MSC are currently under investigation for treatment of tissue injury due to autoimmune disease (Crohn's Disease) and allogeneic immune responses (renal transplant recipients with biopsy proven subclinical rejection). The combination of the immunosuppressive, growth-potentiating and anti-apoptotic properties of BM-MSC may lead to accelerated wound healing after LVRS and might induce lung repair. In the present phase I study the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous (i.v.) administration of BM-MSC prior to LVRS in a small group of severe pulmonary emphysema patients. Results of this safety and feasibility study may lead to future studies on the use of BM-MSC for immunomodulation and induction of repair in patients with pulmonary emphysema and milder stages of COPD.\n\nObjective To test the safety and feasibility of intravenous administration of autologous BM-MSC after one-sided LVRS and prior to a second LVRS procedure for patients with severe pulmonary emphysema.\n\nStudy design Open label, non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective clinical trial. Patients are operated in two sessions; initially on one lung without pre-surgical infusion of BM-MSC, followed by a second surgical procedure on the contralateral lung which is preceded by two i.v. infusions of BM-MSC one week apart, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the lung surgery.\n\nStudy population Patients of at least 40 years of age with end-stage emphysema who are eligible for lung volume reduction surgery.\n\nIntervention The intervention consists of two doses of BM-MSC infusions in 10 patients with a one week interval, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the second LVRS respectively.\n\nStudy endpoints\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n1. Safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of two doses of BM-MSC with 1 wk interval after the first LVRS and prior to a second LVRS. Toxicity criteria will be evaluated by grade according to WHO.\n\nSecondary endpoint:\n\nDifference in days between post-surgical transpleural air leak of the lung in each patient after the first (no infusion of BM-MSC) and second surgical (3 weeks after the last i.v. infusion of BM-MSC) intervention.\nHistological responses in resected lung tissue (measured by immunohistochemistry of markers of inflammation, fibrosis and repair)."

                              "Background:\n\nNephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare disease characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria and the need for steroid treatment. About 50% of children will become frequent relapsers (FRNS) or steroid dependent (SDNS), requiring higher doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for many years, sometimes up to adulthood. Strong evidence suggests that Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), at least in the steroid-sensitive forms, has an immune pathogenesis.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that produce an immunomodulatory activity in-vitro and in-vivo. For this reason, we postulated that SDNS patients could benefit with treatment with MSC.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe main goal of the present study is to assess whether CB-MSCs have the capacity to regulate the immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NS allowing for a reduction or suspension of chronic immunosuppressive treatment in SDNS children. The primary objective is to evaluate whether CB-MSC therapy is able to prevent NS recurrence for at least 6 months after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment in children with SDNS.\n\nPrimary endpoint: percentage of children without NS recurrence after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment for at least 6 months.\n\nPopulation:\n\nWe plan to enroll 11 children (3 to 18 years of age) with SDNS, maintained by chronic immunosuppressive treatment and with stable remission for at least two months.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nOpen label single-arm, monocentric trial, with a rescue/second design\n\nPhase: Phase II\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria:\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAge between 3 and 18 years;\nClinical diagnosis of SDNS;\n\nDisease remission maintained by chronic therapy (at least 6 months) with either:\n\nUse of a combination of 2 or more immunosuppressive drugs\nuse of 1 of the calcineurin inhibitors (Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus);\nAbsence of proteinuria (urinary protein:urinary creatinine < 0.2 mg/mg) for at least 1 month;\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate greater than or equal to 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;\nWritten informed consent from parents or guardians and the child when possible.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nAge < 3 years or \u2265 19 years;\nResistant/refractory NS;\nPresence of genetic mutations associated with NS;\neGFR less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;\nThrombophilic condition;\nPregnancy or lactating;\nEvidence of an uncooperative attitude;\nAny evidence that the patient will be unable to complete the trial follow-up.\n\nDescription of the Intervention:\n\nThe trial will rely on a single advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP), made by MSC from umbilical cord blood (CB) for allogeneic use, produced following a highly standardized process, developed and controlled at Cell Factory under the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines.\n\nAfter baseline clinical and laboratory evaluation, patients will receive 3 intravenous infusions of CB-MSCs at the dosage of 1.5 x 10^6/kg at a time interval of 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe immunosuppressive treatment will be gradually tapered off following the first CB-MSC administration: 25%, 50% and 100% reduction of the ongoing immunosuppressive treatment following the first, second and third administration, respectively.\n\nAt the end of this first part of the trial, a statistical analysis will be performed according to the primary end-point. In the case of failure to reach the primary end point an extra 11 children with SDNS will be enrolled in a single stage phase 2 study with a 30% incremented dose of CB-MSCs.\n\nStatistical Evaluation:\n\nA phase II design with a rescue plan B, is adopted to decide whether the proportion responding is less than or equal to 0.200 or greater than or equal to 0.600. A sample size of 10 children is required, considering a drop out of 10%, 11 children will be enrolled: if the number of responses is 5 or more, the hypothesis that P \u2264 0.200 is rejected with a target error rate of 5%. If the number of responses is 4 or less, the hypothesis that P \u2265 0.600 is rejected with a target error rate of 20% (power equal to 80%). The same statistical hypothesis will apply for the second part of the study.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe results of this proposal will provide information regarding an innovative cell therapy for the treatment of INS. If the hypothesis of this study is confirmed, it will be possible to reduce or withdraw immunosuppressive treatment in this vulnerable population of children with SDNS, reducing the need for ambulatory visits and hospitalization and therapy-related complications. Furthermore, the reduction in the use of immunosuppressive agents as well as in the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions will reduce the financial burden to the National Health Service. Above all, the quality of life of children with SDNS would clearly be improved, in terms of a reduction in long-term therapy, morbidity and the number of visits."

The patients will undergo lipoaspiration under sterile conditions of the operating theatre, the collected lipoaspirates will be further processed - enzymatically with the use of collagenase or mechanically using the Lipogems system. After collection, lipoaspirates will be immediately transferred to the laboratory of the Department of Regenerative Medicine with a tissue and cells bank in Warsaw, and the preparations will be administered to the patients' knee joints in the operating room under ultrasound control.\n\nThe Lipogems system is defined as a minimal tissue manipulation system. In contrast, the administration of preparations produced using an enzymatic method requires advanced actions.\n\nLipoaspiration will be performed using blind cannulas and vacuum syringes introduced through the abdominal wall with a three-millimetre incision on the skin after previous injection to the adipose tissue with modified Klein's solution (500 ml of saline solution, 1 ml of adrenaline, 40 ml of 2% lignocaine), which makes the collection easier. 10 ml of the collected adipose tissue will be used to examine the samples after previous gradient drainage from Klein's solution. Immediately after collection, the samples will be sent to the laboratory for analysis (cell count testing, culture, phenotype identification, analysis by flow cytometry).\n\nThe patients will be monitored in the hospital outpatient clinic for one year after the procedure; the control visits will take place: after 2 and 6 weeks, then after 3 and 6 months and after a year. A physical examination and the assessment using the KOOS questionnaire will be performed. Before the procedure and after one year, an X-ray and MRI with T-2 Mapping will be carried out in order to evaluate the condition of the cartilage."

                              "General context:\n\nAs of March 13, 2020, more than 145,000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed with 5,500 deaths worldwide. As of March 21, 14,469 cases have been confirmed in France, of which 562 have been fatal while 1,525 patients are currently hospitalized in intensive care units. Whereas the pandemic continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients (Murthy et al., 2020) with a 30%-60% mortality rate. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 variation from baseline at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be randomized to cell-treatment administered via intravenous route while the remaining 20 patients will be randomized to receive a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Patients will be followed up to 12 months after treatment.\n\nState of the art:\n\nMesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020), regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products.\n\nSo far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018) and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al., 2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010).\n\nOnce they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013) and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017).\n\nGiven the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 circulating levels and an increase in CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng et al., 2020)."

Relevant patients with bipolar depression will be addressed in order to establish whether they are willing to be screened for the study. The patients must be assigned a patient number and sign the consent form after receiving oral and written information about the study prior to undergoing any study procedures.\n\nMSCs will be infused as a single dose up to one week after the inclusion of the patient. The treatment trial lasts eight weeks. Of note, the investigators will assess patients also at week 26 with a neurocognitive and clinical battery. It will not be allowed changes in psychiatric medication during this period. If a patient or the treating clinician decides that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians. The investigators defined refractory bipolar depression as depression that failed to respond to two trials (during lifetime) with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizer with proven efficacy in bipolar depression (lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) in adequate doses for at least 6 weeks or until cessation of treatment due to side effects (Schoeyen et al., 2015).\n\nAfter the initial injection, patients will continue maintenance treatment with their current psychiatrist. During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive treatment as usual per their clinician's choice. Patients will remain on stable psychiatric medications during this period. If patients need to change medications, they will be removed from the study protocol."

                              "Study Design and Setting The study was carried out at the Internal Medicine Intensive Care Unit (IMICU) and Anesthesiology and Reanimation Intensive Care Unit (ARICU) at Erciyes University Hospital which is a referral hospital in the Central Anatolia. The study was approved by the Erciyes University Ethics Board (2016/114; Date: 19.02.2016) and Ministry of Health of Turkey. Informed consent from surrogate decision-makers was taken for study participation after confirmation of eligibility criteria.\n\nPatients The study was planned as prospectively. During two years, 10 patients with sepsis and septic shock were included in the study from IMICU and ARICU. Sepsis and septic shock were diagnosed according to the sepsis guidelines [1]. Inclusion criteria for this study were; patients who were between 18-80 years of age and were hospitalized at IMICU and ARICU with the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock. Exclusion criteria were categorized that patients who were younger than 18-year-old and older than 80 years and were pregnant women or breast-feeding; patients who had terminal stage of cancer, advanced pulmonary disease receiving oxygen at home, advanced pulmonary hypertension (WHO Class III or IV), advanced heart failure (American Heart Association Class III or IV), severe liver disease (Child C), and history of anaphylaxis. Standard therapy of sepsis as suggested in the guidelines [1,2] were given to all patients and additionally MSCs treatment was applied to the patients in the study group. Control patients diagnosed sepsis and septic shock and having similar characteristics for the consideration of severity of disease based on APACHE II score and co-morbid diseases with study group were selected from IMICU and ARICU records retrospectively.\n\nPatients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded.\n\nSource and Application of MSCs MSCs were prepared in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Laboratory of Genome and Stem Cell Center at Erciyes University. Cell production and quality control assessment procedures were carried out according to GMP protocols authorized by the Ministry of Health of Turkey. Allogenic adipose derived MSCs (ADMSCs) which were obtained from a healthy donor were applied to all patients in the study group. Five doses of ADMSCs were applied to the patients at 1st and 3rd day (post-thawed of frozen MSCs cryo-bag), 5th-7th and 9th day (re-plated ADMSCs vials) of therapy. Each dose of ADMSCs was prepared as 1 x 106 ADMSCs/kg. The vials containing ADMSCs were mixed with gentle motions before the usage; thus, it ensured product homogenization. ADMSCs were infused intravenously via central venous line in a physiological saline solution by using a blood transfusion set. The patients were monitored during all these procedures.\n\nPreparation of ADMSCs Sufficient cryo-preserved ADMSCs vials were thawed to provide the required dose for administration. The frozen ADMSCs were thawed and cultured in the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% human serum, 1% Penicillin- Streptomycin solution, and 1% stable glutamine (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 incubator which described before [16]. Briefly, ADMSCs were recovered and resuspended in physiological saline solution and transferred to the patient with the temperature-controlled bag. The morphology of cell appearance and the viability were assessed beside the identification of phenotypic characteristics of the cells and microbiological tests. Immunophenotyping characterization of ADMSCs was performed by using flow cytometry analyses (Beckman Coulter, USA) with antibodies against CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD44 (BD Stem Flow hMSC kit).\n\nCytokine Analysis Ten ml peripheral venous blood samples were collected before each MSCs infusion at 1st, 3rd,5th, 7thand 9th day of therapy. The serum samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes and stored at - 80\u00b0C until laboratory analysis. Cytokine level was analyzed with ELISA method by using Human BioSource for (TNF-, IFN- \u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10) kits in Robonik Read Well Touch model (Robonik India Pvt Ltd) device.\n\nClinical and Laboratory Follow-up Clinical findings and laboratory results were recorded at the administration of MSCs infusions at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th days. Patients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded. The patients were monitored for unexpected adverse events. In the clinical follow-up of the patients APACHE II, SOFA (the sequential organ failure assessment score) score, clinical progression and outcome of patients were recorded. As laboratory following, inflammatory markers; C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cell (WBC), bleeding parameters (platelets, INR, fibrinogen), lactate, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), renal functions (creatinine) were also recorded. Laboratory test results were analyzed according to MSCs administration days. The differences of the laboratory tests were compared between the survivor and non-survivor patients according to MSCs therapy days.\n\nOutcomes of the patients were compared with the previous observational study conducted in the same Intensive Care Units (ICUs) as control. The day of death and 0-6th, 7-14th, and 15-28th days were determined as survival status and endpoint. In case of death, the date and cause of death were also recorded.\n\nStatistical Analysis In the study, the results were compared to controls. Statistical analysis was performed using Turcosa software. The relationships between categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square analysis. When parametric assumptions were provided in comparison of numerical variables in two groups, the Student-T test was used and the Mann Whitney U test was in the case that the parametric assumptions did not provide. For the analysis of repeated measurements; Paired Sample T-Test was used for binary comparisons and the Repeated Measures ANOVA test was used for comparison of more than two repeated measurements. The survival probability of the patients during the follow-up period was determined by Kaplan-Maier survival analysis. The effect of age and APACHE II to co-variants analysis were adjusted. p <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant."

                              "The general aim of the project is to develop a treatment for severe hoarseness due to vocal fold (VF) scarring. Vocal fold scarring can be caused by tumor surgery, radiotherapy, severe inflammation or is early acquired (sulcus vocalis with scar) and results in stiff vocal folds with decreased vibratory capacity and severe deterioration or total loss of voice (aphonia). There is no lasting effective treatment. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are immunomodulatory, decrease inflammation and improve endogenous healing. After receiving ethical permission the investigators have since 2012 treated 16 patients with manifest vocal fold scarring and severe hoarseness by scar resection and local injection of autologous bone marrow MSC to restore speech. This project was the first in the world to study the effects of MSC treatment of vocal fold scarring in humans. Analysis was made before and up to 12 months post operatively with voice recordings, examination with high speed camera and elasticity measurements of the vocal folds with novel technology. No side effects were found for any patient and for two thirds of the patients with 12 months follow-up the vocal fold function improved and no patient deteriorated.\n\nWhile cell therapy with autologous MSC was classified according to the Tissue Legislation before 2015, it is now regarded as drug treatment. In accordance with this legislation, the MSC production is now full scale GMP. The investigators have recently received permissions from Swedish Medical Product Agency (DNr 5.1-2019-92069) and from the Regional ethic committee (Drn 2019-06160) for an open Phase I/Il study in patients with severe dysphonia and vocal fold scarring to evaluate safety, tolerability and vocal function after surgery with local administration of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell product KI-MSC-PL-204 as an extended study on 15 patients.\n\nMSC may in the future be used to treat patients with severe hoarseness due to scarring, as well as other damages in the airways."

Patients will be eligible for treatment with 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC at 1 million cells/kg (max dose 100 million cells) in the phase 1 portion of the study or a fixed dose of 100 million cells daily x 3 days, 12-36 hours apart in the phase 2 portion of the study, if they have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS. The primary endpoint is short-term safety of hCT-MSC infusions given on this schedule. The key secondary endpoints are 28 day survival, an increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio by 50% at 96 hours, days to hospital discharge to home or rehab, and number of days requiring mechanical or non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula.\n\nThe study will be executed in two phases. The first 10 consecutive patients will all receive investigational product. The second part of the study is a randomized, controlled trial in 40 additional patients. The overall aim of the study is to establish safety and to gain critical information as to whether patients with COVID-ARDS will benefit from MSC infusions. Results from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the medical literature. Results from the additional 40 patients will be analyzed as a randomized placebo control trial. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study.\n\nThe MSCs are manufactured from allogeneic cord tissue donated to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank (CCBB) at Duke University. The CCBB is an FDA licensed public cord blood bank (licensed name DUCORD). Cord tissue is donated by mothers delivering healthy term male babies by Cesarean section, after written informed consent from the newborn infant's mother. Full donor screening and testing is performed in accordance with regulatory requirements (21CFR 1271). The hCT-MSCs will be manufactured in the Marcus Center for Cellular Cures in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and the Clinical Research Cell Manufacturing Program (CRCMP) laboratory, Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute (ISCI), Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami. These hCT-MSCs are already being utilized in clinical trials to treat pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder (IND 17313), cerebral palsy (IND 17921), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (IND 17313) and adults with osteoarthritis of the knee (IND18414). To date, over 210 doses of cells have been delivered to patients on these clinical trials with an excellent safety profile. At University of Miami, hCT-MSCs are used in the clinical trial to evaluate cytokine suppression in patients with chronic inflammation due to metabolic syndrome (IND 17324), 12 subjects in the pilot phase of the study had completed the dose without any treatment emergence SAE.\n\nThe rationale for using this approach for patients infected with COVID-19 is that ARDS, the rate-limiting complication impacting survival, is caused, at least in part, by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which results is severe immune dysregulation. Involved cytokines include IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, THP-1M, TNF-alpha, and others. MSCs have strong anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities without apparent toxicity or further immunosuppression. Approximately 3-5 % of patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS which carries a very high mortality rate (30-60%) due to multi-system organ failure. Effective treatment of ARDS, the most feared complication of COVID-19, may convert the COVID-19 pandemic into a more manageable \"flu-like\" illness that every American is expected to experience, and most will survive, on an annual basis."

                              "Background:The most common problem following a kidney transplant is the development of acute or chronic rejection. Rejection is the immunologic reaction in which the body refuses to accept the transplanted organ. The body's immune system will make destructive antibodies that will attempt to attack the transplanted organ.\n\nIn order to prevent organ rejection, all patients receiving an allograft (a graft transplanted between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species) must take anti-rejection (immunosuppressive) therapy. These medications function by lowering the body's natural immune system. Often these medications are associated with significant side effects ranging from infections to cancer.\n\nStudy:\n\nThis is a single center, open label, dose-escalation clinical trial in 6 adult recipients of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)- non-identical, living-donor renal allografts. All participants will receive induction therapy with alemtuzumab followed by maintenance therapy with sirolimus and belatacept.\n\nA total of 3 dosing cohorts of 2 recipients each will receive 12 infusions of donor-derived MSCs starting on Day 42 post-transplant and every 4 weeks starting on Day 56 post-transplant, with a minimum of 7 days between the first and second MSC infusions.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine whether immune reconstitution after lymphocyte depletion in the setting of co-stimulatory blockade and systemic MSC-derived donor antigen can promote operational tolerance in recipients of kidney allografts.\n\nParticipants will be evaluated for eligibility for sirolimus withdrawal any time between week 52 and week 104 post-transplant. Participants who successfully complete sirolimus withdrawal will remain on belatacept monotherapy for at least 24 weeks before being assessed for eligibility to discontinue belatacept. Participants who successfully complete Immunosuppression Withdrawal (ISW) will then undergo 24 weeks of high frequency follow up followed by 132 weeks of standard follow up.\n\nStudy participation may continue for up to seven (7) years after kidney transplant surgery.\n\n*** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed, controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider."

This study will enroll patients that have persistent symptomatic perianal disease despite being treated with an MSC coated fistula plug, and also treat patients that have had recurrence of their perianal fistula.\n\nAs per the previously approval treatment under IND 15356, patients will have a single affected fistula treated, which is the same fistula that was treated in the original protocol. The matrix for delivering the cells is a Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug.\n\nSubjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified subjects will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessment will be made if an EUA is clinically necessary to assess the fistula. As this is a re-treatment trial, patients with incomplete response to initial plug placement typically have close follow up, recent MRI imaging, and may have a seton in place. If an EUA is clinically indicated, this would be by a colorectal surgeon for drainage of sepsis and placement of a seton as part of the standard clinical care for perianal fistula.\n\nPatients will return on: Day 1, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24."

The second part is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase I/II study in parallel design comparing allogeneic WJMSC treatment to placebo in adult patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Besides safety, preservation of endogenous insulin production (measured as C-peptide concentrations) together with metabolic control, diabetes treatment satisfaction and immunological profile will be assessed.\n\nA total number of 24 patients will be enrolled in the study and followed for one year after WJMSC/placebo treatment. Patients 18-40 years of age, both male and female, diagnosed for type 1 diabetes will be eligible. Providing informed consent and fulfillment of inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, they will within two years of diagnosis be randomized."

The therapeutic course will consist of 5 instillations with an interval of 1 days.\n\nThe primary outcome measure is the incidence of death, the incidence of survival with any of either severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), or brain injury on cranial ultrasound and MRI or major neurodevelopmental impairment determined at 36 months of age corrected for prematurity (where major neurodevelopmental impairment is defined as any of the following: cognitive deficit, cerebral palsy, or severe visual or hearing impairment. Cognitive delay defined as mental developmental index (MDI) score of the Griffiths-II and Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd edition) < 85, cerebral palsy, or severe visual or hearing impairment.\n\nTo investigate this outcomes and the mechanisms by which extracellular vesicles (EVs) might effect we will analyze the biomarkers of perinatal brain injury (S-100, NSE, EPO) and mRNA.\n\nKey secondary outcomes are incidences of short term outcomes: individual components of the composite primary outcome, survival with and without major neonatal morbidity including severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).\n\nSafety analyses will assess the injures or damages of the nasal mucosa, allergic reaction to EVs and any adverse events after intranasal administration of EVs.\n\nThe results of this trial may help to improve the quality of life of ELBW infants and reduce long-term health care costs."

Despite the improved survival attributed to advances in HSCT including transplantation techniques and supportive care, transplant-related pneumonia (severe pneumonia in particular) remains the leading cause of death for most HSCT patients and a major challenge for clinicians.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a form of multipotent cells, have been applied in therapy for various intractable disorders. MSC exerts its therapeutic effect through various biological functions including immunoregulation, tissue repairing, self-renew and differentiating into various cell lines. The American Thoracic Society has also suggested MSCs as a cell therapy agent for lung diseases. However, MSC therapy for pneumonia following HSCT has not been well investigated.\n\nBy investigating the efficacy of MSC treatment for HSCT-related pneumonia via comparing the outcomes in patients with and without MSC treatment, this study will provide a promising therapy for HSCT-related pneumonia."

Safety assessments include monitoring of acute infusion reactions, adverse events, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization. Clinical outcome measures will also be described. A key clinical outcome measeure is the change in social communication abilities from baseline to 6 months based on the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI), a commonly-used and well-validated coding system for rating the quality and quantity of social communication skills in toddlers with and without ASD.91 JERI coding rates social communication abilities on a 1 to 7 scale and factors in both the quantity and quality of skills. The total joint engagement score as well as ratings on all JERI subscales that comprise the total score will be described.\n\nOther clinical endpoints will include the PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) autism composite score, the mean of the Socialization Subscale Standard Score and Communication Subscale Standard Score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) - Severity and Improvement Scales, the Communicative Development Inventories (CDI-2): Words & Sentences subscales, attention abilities via eye-tracking, and brain activity.\n\nExploratory clinical endpoints will include autism symptoms measured by an app that elicits and records autism symptoms on an iPad (SenseToKnow), Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) Calibrated Severity Score (overall, social affect, and repetitive behavior), PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) Subscales, and VABS-3 Standard Score and age equivalent for the following subscales: Socialization, Communication, and Daily Living and the Standard Score and age equivalent for the VABS-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite.\n\nSafety and VABS-3 assessments will also be conducted remotely at three and 12 months. Duration of study participation will be 12 months from the time of the baseline infusion."

                              "This is a prospective, open label, phase one study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSCs are manufactured from umbilical cord tissue donated by healthy mothers delivering full term babies via Cesarean Section. The cells are extracted from the cord tissue, expanded and cryopreserved (frozen). One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant in this study.\n\nIt is hypothesized that immune dysregulation and/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that adversely affects normal brain development may cause core symptomatology observed in individuals with ASD. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated a multitude of immunomodulatory effects which are thought to be carried out via paracrine and trophic signaling. While MSCs modulate the immune response, MSCs themselves have low immunogenicity (the body does not have a strong immune reaction against them) and they do not permanently engraft in the recipient.\n\nAdults ages 18 to less than 35 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will have a screening visit that includes clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD, cognitive abilities, ASD symptom level, and confirmation of eligibility.\n\nOne dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant at a baseline visit. Participants will be admitted to the infusion center on the day of their baseline visit and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate) will be measured. Participants may require some sedation prior to IV placement if requested. A peripheral IV will be placed and prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Solumedrol, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs product will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluid maintenance will be given. Participants will be discharged after 1 hour, providing all vital signs are at their baseline and they are asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity. Participants will be evaluated the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications. A phone call or email will be done to assess safety of the infusion 7-10 days after the infusion. Remote follow up will occur one year after infusion. Participants will return to Duke six months after infusion for repeated testing and safety follow-up. The Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire assessing adverse events will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 12-months.\n\nThe main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization will be assessed. Key secondary endpoints will include ASD-specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after product administration. Exploratory analyses will include measures obtained by EEG, eye-tracking, pupillary light reflex, computer vision analysis, and tactile stimulation."

If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three patients will receive two doses, given two months apart. The third cohort will consist of six patients, each of whom will receive three hCT-MSC infusions with a two-month interval between doses. All participants will have an initial clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD and confirm protocol eligibility. The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions and incidence of infections will be assessed. ASD-specific outcome measures, described below, will be assessed at baseline and six months from baseline and results will be described."

Nine patients will be recruited during stage 1 of the study. Once 9 patients have completed their 24 weeks visit, the study will stop for futility if only 2 or fewer patients have survived with the native liver. Otherwise, the study will progress to Stage 2 of recruitment, where the trial will continue to enroll a further 8 patients. A total of 17 patients will be recruited into the study (at the end of stages 1 and 2). At the end of the second stage, 7 or more patients out of the 17 enrolled should have survived with the native liver at 24 weeks post HMB002 treatment, to show evidence of efficacy of this novel hepatocyte transplantation that would support a larger randomised controlled trial.\n\nFollowing signed informed consent from parent/legal guardian, the following screening tests and procedures will be undertaken to ensure patient is eligible to take part in the study (some of these may be part of routine care).\n\nMedical and Medication History\nPhysical examination\nHeight and weight monitoring\nVital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation)\nUrine or serum pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential\nClinical blood tests and additional research bloods\nRecording of neurological parameters\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nQuality of Life - Parent and where appropriate patient questionnaires (optional)\n\nEnrolled participants will have pre-infusion checks and monitoring in the paediatric high dependency unit (HDU) or Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Children with acute liver failure generally require this degree of monitoring in any case. The child may be intubated and ventilated as part of routine care. This involves ventilation using a machine to help move air into and out of the lungs. If a suitable donor liver becomes available within 12 hours of planned study treatment, patient will go onto receive a liver transplant.\n\nFollowing successful pre-infusion checks, the solution containing beads will be infused manually into the peritoneal cavity with usually a 50ml syringe, as a single infusion or several infusions, to achieve in excess of 25 million hepatocytes per kilogram of the body weight. HMB002 infusion will be done under ultrasound guidance.\n\nParticipants will be continuously monitored before and for at least 24 hours after infusion in PICU/HDU. Some of these tests outlined below will be as per HDU and PICU standard of care. Once clinical condition permits and after 24 hours post infusion, the child may be stepped down to the paediatric wards.\n\nPhysical and neurological examination\nIntra-abdominal pressure will be measured using urinary catheter where possible, at regular intervals both before and after infusion.\nRegular review of the IMP infusion site\nregular Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation) \u2022 Clinical bloods at regular intervals both pre and post infusion.\nAdditional research bloods\nRecording of ventilator settings and additional supportive therapy given as part of standard of care \u2022 Ultrasound of the abdomen\nRecording of side effects\nRecording of change in medications\n\nParticipants will undergo daily examination until Day 7 while still an inpatient, and then be followed up at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 52. Participants will be discharged following a liver organ transplant or upon recovery of their native liver. Therefore some of the follow up visits will be done in the outpatient clinics at King's College Hospital. Patients will have some or all of the assessments below at each follow up visit. Some of these visits will be part of standard routine care.\n\nPhysical and neurological examination\nHeight and weight monitoring,\nMonitoring of Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation)\nClinical Blood tests and additional bloods for research (at some visits\u037e optional)\nRecording of level of ventilator settings and supportive treatment as given with routine care.\nRecording of side effects\nRecording of changes to Medication\nParent and where appropriate patient questionnaires at final visit (optional parents/legal guardian consent\nUltrasound of the abdomen at specified time points in the protocol.\n\nMicrobeads will ideally be removed within 4 weeks of infusion. This will be done at the time of liver transplant or upon recovery of the native liver prior to discharge (using laparoscopy, a small key hole surgery of the abdomen).\n\nParticipants will also be followed up for another 9 years after HMB0002 infusion for monitoring of long term safety. This will be aligned with routine care and will be conducted annually as a minimum but may be more frequent depending on the clinical condition of the child or young person. Clinical blood tests and abdominal ultrasound data will be collected annually during the long term follow up period (years 2 to 5 as per routine care). SAEs (with exceptions) will be collected for the duration of the follow up period as outlined in the study protocol."

The neutrophils exude, the platelets aggregate, and the small vessels of the graft get thrombosed, resulting in ischemic damage,leading nonfunction grafts.In addition, if the A\u3001 B antibodies remain high level, it can lead to acute humoral immune rejection. A lot of research confirmed that the ABO incompatible is a risk factor of postoperative short- and long-term survival. And mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are characterized by the properties of immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, which make MSCs great attractive in treating immunological diseases (including transplant rejection) and organ/tissue ischemic injury. So we conduct this clinical study,to confirm the effect of MSCs in ABO incompatible liver transplantation by comparing the incidence of primary nonfunction, acute rejection, biliary complications and survival rates."

In this protocol, the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture in the iliac crest. This procedure was performed in the operating room, under anesthesia and by a medical specialist. The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) with heparin (Sanofi Aventis). The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium (Irvine Scientific, USA) enriched with 20% autologous serum. These cells were kept in culture in a controlled environment at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells were eliminated, and a basal culture medium (alpha-MEM-Chang / 20% autologous serum) was added. Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs. Culture medium exchanges were made until reaching a confluence close to 70-80%. The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures, following the process described above. Microbiological examinations were performed after obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation. After using MSC, a batch of these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C.\n\nPhenotypic characterization of MSC. Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried out by flow cytometry. For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask by using trypsin-like enzymes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD29, CD166 and CD49b) and hematopoietic (CD34, CD45 and CD14). Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100% of the cells used for transplantation in each patient were MSC.\n\nMSC differentiation studies. The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined by culturing these cells in osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media, following a methodology similar to that previously described. Briefly, the MSCs were detached and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well, proceeding to add the corresponding differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone (100nM, Biotech), ascorbic acid (10mM, Sigma), inorganic phosphate (1.8mM, Merck) and beta-glycerol phosphate (2mM, Sigma). For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes (Cell Application, USA) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial medium NH Adipodiff Human (Miltenyi, USA) was used. In all cases, the cells were kept in culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days. To demonstrate the changes associated with the differentiation process, the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (Merck, USA) and specific stains were performed for each case. Briefly, alizarin red to detect calcium deposition (evidence of osteogenesis), Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans (evidence of chondrogenesis), and oil red (Oil Red) to see lipids (evidence of adipogenesis). In all cases, microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out. For endothelial differentiation (CEn), EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, USA) enriched with 10% autologous serum, 10\u00b5g / ml of human epidermal growth factor (hu-EGF, R&D) and hydrocortisone (1\u00b5g / ml, Sigma).\n\nMSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. All MSC processing procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to induce bone regeneration. The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been phenotypically and functionally characterized. The MSC will be thawed, grown and expanded as previously described. A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs, and another part will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium (CEM-Endo). Once the required number of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached, a suspension of these cells (75,000 cells from each of them) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium, without phenol red, supplemented with 20% autologous serum. Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar, at room temperature, to the Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (IVIC).\n\nUnder sterile conditions, the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth area; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC / MSC-Endo / PRP implant. At the same time, the culture medium supernatant is removed from each tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo \"button (pellet)\" is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension, 5% CaCl2 and thrombin will be added. Immediately, and before the clot forms, 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP suspension will be placed in the root canal, covered with a collagen membrane. Subsequently, the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp chamber, ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the tooth.\n\nPost-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF\n\nClinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of EMC.\nRadiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of mesenchymal stromal cells.\nA tomographic evaluation will be performed when the periapical repair will be evident in a periapical radiograph."

                              "Since its introduction into clinical trials, cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloro-platinum) has had a major impact in cancer medicine, changing the course of therapeutic management of several tumors, such as those of ovary, testes, and the head and neck. Unfortunately, in addition to causing bone marrow suppression, ototoxicity, and anaphylaxis, dose-dependent and cumulative nephrotoxicity is the major toxicity of this compound, sometimes requiring a reduction in dose or discontinuation of treatment. Approximately 25-35% of patients develop evidence of nephrotoxicity following an initial dose (50-100 mg/m2) of cisplatin, due to its preferential accumulation within the proximal tubular cells in the outer medulla of the kidney. Tubular cell events activated by cisplatin toxicity translate into the fact that cisplatin predictably lowers glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a clear dose-dependent manner even after a single drug exposure. Early proteinuria is mild, as it is glycosuria. Overall these findings indicate that there is a pressing need for way to protect the kidney while administering effective chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin.\n\nPresent strategies for the treatment of acute renal failure have focused on targeting individual mechanisms thought to contribute to ischemic or toxic insults to the kidney.An alternative possibility is to adopt a novel strategy that would allow regeneration of the injured renal tissue. Renal recovery following acute tubular injury, like that induced by cisplatin treatment, is often a slow process requiring many days to weeks to occur. Attempts to accelerate recovery have focused on the administration of growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1. While growth factor therapy has been successful in experimental models, no beneficial effects have been observed in limited clinical trials. The ability of extrarenal cells to participate in the regenerative response following post-transplant acute renal failure may hold true for acute renal failure that develops in native kidneys after cisplatin therapy. The rationale for this approach rests on the recent demonstration in mice and in athymic nude rats that stem cells from bone marrow can be used to grow new muscle or blood vessels in heart tissue that has been damaged after myocardial infarction. Similarly, consistent evidence of the beneficial effect of bone-marrow derived cell therapy has been recently reported in humans with ischemic heart disease. This approach has been also successfully extended to repair ischemically and cisplatin injured renal tubules in mice. The observation raises the possibility that adult-derived bone marrow cells could be administered to enhance the recovery from renal injury. Although no human data so far are available, we expect that ex-vivo expanded donor bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) infusion would allow to accelerate tubular regeneration and thus renal function recovery in patients with cisplatin-induced acute renal failure, a disease that, like ischemically-induced acute renal injury, so far has no cure.\n\nUp to now there is no clinical study of repair tissue injury in patients with acute renal failure due to ischemic or toxic insults. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the effectiveness of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions like as inborn errors of metabolism,osteogenesis imperfecta,allogeneic HSC transplantation, treatment of acute GVHD, acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe aim of this pilot, explorative, study is to test the feasibility and safety of systemic infusion of donor ex-vivo expanded MSC to repair the kidney and improve function in patients with solid organ cancers who develop acute renal failure after chemotherapy with cisplatin."

This is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one or two intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with moderate to severe HIE who are recipients of therapeutic hypothermia. Infants born at 36 0/7 weeks gestation or later who have moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are receiving therapeutic hypothermia will be eligible to participate. Investigators project an accrual of 6 patients. All infants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of hCT-MSCs. The first cohort of three infants will receive a single dose in the first 48 postnatal hours. If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three infants will receive two doses, with the first dose given in the first 48 postnatal hours and the second dose given approximately two months after the first dose.\n\nThe potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization. Another risk of this study is loss of confidentiality or privacy. Every effort will be made to keep the infant's medical record confidential. The results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and statistical testing as appropriate. Continuous secondary endpoints will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, CV%, median, minimum, and maximum."

The goal of this study is to determine the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.\n\nThe MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually located in the arm or hand.

Prevalence is estimated to be 8-16% worldwide. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease and usually means that the patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT), which may involve a kidney transplant or a form of dialysis. One of the options in RRT is continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD is characterized by a continuous removal of extracellular fluid by peritoneal membrane. It should be noted that like any other peritoneal dialysis therapy, CAPD has Short or long-term complications and UFF is the most common functional disorder in which the peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damaged.\n\nThis project intends to evaluate, the role of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients who have ultrafiltration failure up to 6 months.\n\nIn this study, 10 male and female subjects who are on peritoneal dialysis for at least two years and have ultrafiltration failure with age range of 18 to 70 years will be enrolled. Patients will be selected from peritoneal dialysis patients attending the peritoneal dialysis ward of Dr. Shariati hospital. The main inclusion criteria is to be on peritoneal dialysis for at least last two years and having Ultrafiltration failure. After obtaining the consent form, a sample of fat tissue will be obtained by a general surgeon under sterilized condition from patients and then in the specialized lab, the mesenchymal stem cells will be separated and cultured to reach appropriate numbers (106/kg). The cells will be injected through peripheral vein in hospital setting. Patients will be followed-up (clinically and laboratory) at baseline and at week 3, week 6, month 3, month 4 and month 6. The clinical assessment and peritoneal function tests will be performed in each visit. Outcome measures: The main outcome measures that periodically will be assessed include: D/P cr, D/P urea, D0/D glucose, PET, KT/V urea, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)"

                              "Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is an important perinatal cause of long-lasting neurodevelopmental problems. Recent studies report an incidence of PAIS of 1 per 2300 full-term infants born alive. Adverse consequences of PAIS include hemiplegia, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy and speech problems. In 50-75% of infants, neonatal stroke leads to abnormal neuromotor and -developmental outcome or epilepsy. The estimated annual mortality rate of neonatal stroke is 3.49/100,000 annually. Current treatment options for PAIS mainly focus on controlling convulsions and associated infections. There is no treatment available that leads to reduction of neonatal brain damage in this severely affected group of infants. This leads to life-long consequences of PAIS and forms a large burden for patients and society. The overall aim of this project is to meet this need by developing a cell based treatment strategy. Animal models of neonatal brain injury provide evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of intranasal mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) application in the treatment of PAIS. Additionally, results from human trials with MSCs in the treatment of adult stroke or other pathologic conditions provide evidence that MSC treatment is safe. This project aims at making the first step towards clinical application of MSCs to treat PAIS. Successful completion of this project will provide the first evidence of the safety and feasibility of MSCs to treat brain damage in newborn infants. This study will assess safety and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs, administered by the nasal route, in neonates who suffered from PAIS."

                              "The acetabular labrum is a wedge shaped fibrocartilage structure attached to the acetabular rim. It is continuous with the transverse acetabular ligament at the inferior aspect of the acetabulum. The medial aspect of the labrum abuts the acetabulum to form the chondrolabral junction.\n\nAnatomic labral refixation aims to preserve healthy tissue and restore native joint anatomy and biomechanics. Labral tears that are caused by Femoro-Acetubular Impingement (FAI) require concomitant correction of bony cam lesions, pincer lesions, or both to prevent reinjury of the labrum. However, repair has not yet been proven to mitigate the osteoarthritic accelerating effects of labral tears. Many patients presenting with hip pain in the third and fourth decade of life already have osteoarthritic changes seen at the time of arthroscopy. Restoring the biomechanics of the joint via labral repair does not reverse this damage and investigating methods to repair early osteoarthritis is important to the future of hip arthroscopy.\n\nBone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has been used effectively in many joints for the management of chondral defect repair. As an alternative to the aforementioned chondral treatment modalities, BMAC treatment does not require multiple procedures or additional waiting time for treatment completion.\n\nWithin the technical constraints of the hip joint, bone marrow aspirate concentrate is feasible and potentially efficacious option for the treatment of chondral defects. Late stage hip osteoarthritis is a known factor implicated in poor outcomes in both the surgical and non-surgical treatment options available for chondral defect management. Preventing late stage hip osteoarthritis is paramount to decrease these poor outcomes and improve the patient's quality of life. Early and effective intervention with modalities that afford patients little to no drawbacks, like BMAC treatment, are necessary to achieve these goals.\n\nThis is a prospective study which will enroll 300 adult subjects with evidence of an acetabular labrum tear and pincer or cam deformity. Labral tears will be diagnosed by clinical exam and positive magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) findings. Pincer deformity is diagnosed with standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis, and cam deformity is diagnosed with antero-posterior and lateral radiographs.\n\nAdministration of diagnostic modalities is independent of study protocol as they are routine standard of care. Upon diagnosis, eligible potential subjects will be approached for study enrollment. After consent, enrolled subjects will undergo arthroscopic labral repair using a capsular chondrolabral preservation technique with or without BMAC based on intra-operative findings. The decision to use BMAC is made intra-operatively; therefore the patients are consented for the BMAC prior to surgery. If the chondrolabral junction shows advanced arthritis or the absolute absence of wear the BMAC is unnecessary and not used. This surgery in the absence of BMAC is considered routine practice and standard of care. Subjects will follow-up at routine post-operative intervals of 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter to monitor progress.\n\nInterval Results:\n\nMartin SD, Kucharik MP, Abraham PF, Nazal MR, Meek WM, Varady NH.

                              "Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN< 0.2 \u00d7 109/L).\n\nAllogeneic BMT from an HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor is the treatment of choice for patients with aplastic anaemia.Transplantation for patients with severe aplastic anaemia from an HLA identical sibling donor is now very successful with a 75-90% chance of long term cure and with overall survival of between 65% and 73% at 5 years for matched-alternative donor transplantation. However, these two approachs are limited by the availability of HLA-matched donors.\n\nPatients without HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor can be offered immunosuppressive treatment (IST) involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). The treatment response with ATG is at best between 60-80%, 30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment. Moreover, a recent study has shown that on multivariate analysis of response at 6 months, only younger age, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), correlate with response to ATG. Patients with SAA or vSAA, with much lower ARC and ALC, were poor response to IST and have high risks of dying of infection and bleeding.\n\nNowadays, with advances in transplant technology, HLA-mismatched related donors and unrelated donors transplantation has achieved good clinical results. Data from the XJ Huang indicated that patients with HLA-mismatched related donors achieved 100% donor myeloid engraftment and have a survival rate of 64.6\u00b112.4%. Retrospectively analyzed results for 154 patients with acquired SAA who received BMT from unrelated donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program showed the probability of OS at 5 years was 56% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%).\n\nCompared with malignant disease, mismatched related donor or unrelated donor HSCT for SAA involves distinct challenges mainly associated with high graft failure and high GVHD. So, if we can find a way to promote implantation meanwhile prevent or reduce GVHD , the efficacy of HLA-mismatched related donors transplantation can improve.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non-hematopoietic progenitors mainly found in BM, cord blood, and adipose tissue. MSCs are attractive because of the ease with which they can be isolated and expanded ex vivo, their ability to undergo multilineage differentiation, and their lack of immunogenicity. These cells were shown to provide support for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in BM micro-environments. In additon, preliminary studies have shown clinical effectiveness of allogeneic MSC in the treatment of refractory graft-versus-host disease and an improvement in or resolution of severe aGVHD when co-transplantation with MSCs. Due to these properties, MSCs have become an interesting candidate for use in cellular therapy and are considered \"theoretically perfect cells\" for potential clinical use against AA mismatched related donors transplantation."

Survivors suffer long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models, MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore organ function, and reduce death.\n\nThe Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims, CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300 million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian centres over approximately 2 years."

                              "CP is characterized by aberrant control of movement or posture of a patient , appearing early in life , and not the result of a recognized progressive or degenerative brain disease . CP is an umbrella term and represents a group of conditions (not a single disorder) , has a broad range of expression with a static condition originally within the developing central nervous system . CP Is a disturbance of movement and or posture . At the present time there is no standard medical or surgical treatment for it .Stem cell therapy is a new and promising treatment .\n\n150 cases of diparetic and quadiparetic spastic CP between 4-14 years old selected among the patients referred to the pediatric neurology outpatient department of Children's Medical Center Hospital (CMC) affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences and had our inclusion criteria. HLA analysis were done for these patients and 36 cases of class 6 matched cases enrolled to the hematopoietic stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MNC) because of necessity of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching in this type of cells and 72 cases among the remaining patients randomly divided to Mesenchymal stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MSC) and control group . Therefore 108 cases enrolled in 3 divided group of 36 patients .\n\nPatients admitted to CMC hospital and intrathecal injection were done with sedation . Only one injection of stem cell was done for each patient . In the control group after insertion of the needle into the skin with an appearance of lumbar puncture simulation , no injection were done without the awareness of the patients or their parents. All of the patients admitted for one day and discharged the next day . As we wrote in the consent form for ethical consideration we are committed to perform stem cell injection for control participants free of charge after 12 months of the follow up . All of the participants will be referred for neurorehabilitation with a identical protocol .Both parents and clinical evaluators are not aware of the 3 divided groups and our study is double blind .Outcome measures will be evaluated 1, 3, 6. and 12 months after intervention .\n\nStandard brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) were done before injection as baseline and will be repeated after 12 months of clinical follow up . This study designed for the evaluation of therapeutic effects of intrathecal MNC and MSC derived from allogenic umbilical cord in change and probable improvement of developmental functions of spastic CP patients between 4-14 years old in comparison with control group .Different scoring systems such as Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) , Gross Motor Function Measure Score (GMFM66) , Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) , Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) , CP QOL , Life Habits Questionnaire and Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity were done at baseline and then will be repeated in follow ups until 12 months of final evaluation .\n\nAcute side effects and probable long term side effects will be reported and noted on our preformed questioners ."

                              "Diabetes affects more than 9% of adults in the United States and this is projected to nearly double by 2025. Both diabetes and obesity are associated with endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endothelial cell inflammation, cardiovascular pro-thrombotic states and are the most common causes of kidney disease and blindness. Endothelium and its progenitors, meaning endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), are an established surrogate of cardiovascular risk outcome measures. EPCs have been defined as CD34+ cells thereby identifying a defined homogenous population from a heterogeneous peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells.\n\nThe investigator and others, have previously shown that EPCs can act as a cellular biomarker that is more reliable than serum based markers for CVD risk estimation. It was demonstrated that gene expression in EPCs change within two weeks of an intervention such as aerobic exercise. On the other-hand serum biomarkers usually take much longer time to change secondary to an intervention. Also the paracrine effect of damaged endothelium is secondary to gene expression changes that have been altered in the progenitor cells several months ahead of discernible changes in serum based biomarkers such as endothelium based inflammatory markers. When serum inflammatory markers are elevated that may mean that the endothelium is already damaged/ inflamed and possibly irreversibly\n\nEPC are the future endothelium, therefore studying EPCs may help us to predict the effect of an intervention (such as a medication or exercise) on the future of endothelium and endothelial function. In normal course of events, the EPCs transition to mature endothelium and replace endothelial cells after normal cell death cycle or programmed apoptosis. However, unfortunately, type 2 diabetes being a pro-inflammatory, high ROS disease process, chronically depletes the EPC population by up-regulating apoptotic pathways mediated by p53. As an apoptotic condition, hyperglycemia even mild (such as prediabetes) affects immature EPCs more so than the mature endothelium. Hence, the damaged and inflamed mature endothelium, with time, is not replaced by EPCs as the progenitor pool has been depleted. This maybe one of the reasons why vascular damage takes 4-5 years to develop following onset of hyperglycemia.\n\nIt is known that GLP1 agonist has positive effect on oxidative stress, and endothelial function, therefore semaglutide can be hypothesized to have a positive effect on EPC and endothelium and possibly reduce fat inflammation. It may also reduce transformation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) towards more fat formation (prevent adipogenesis) which may explain weight reducing capability seen in semaglutide studies (SUSTAIN trials). The use of CD34+ cells and MSCs as a biomarker is novel. One can obtain CD34+ cells from a simple peripheral blood draw (without doing an invasive procedure). The blood is then sorted for a homogenous progenitor/stem cell population. Role of CD34+ve EPCs in vascular biology, heart regeneration and collateral vessel formation as an endothelial progenitor cell is well established. It's role as a biomarker is also being developed. CD34+ cells are the most studied cardiovascular progenitor cells and its efficacy has been established in chronic diseases such as diabetes by Werner et al in 2005.\n\nSimilarly, one can obtain fat derived MSC from fat biopsies, particularly from overweight and obese individuals. Diabetes is not only a state of endothelial dysfunction, it is also a state of fat hyperplasia, insulin resistance at the level of muscle and fat and is associated with high ROS. Improvement of endothelial health is most likely paired with healthier fat. A state of healthier fat will be associated with healthy adipocytes, pre-adipocytes and healthy MSCs.\n\nThe weight reducing data from SUSTAIN 6 trial using semaglutide at 0.5mg and 1.0mg, is encouraging. It has also shown significant improvement in blood pressure and HbA1C within 8 weeks and definitely by 16 weeks even at a lower FDA approved dose of 0.5mg once a week.\n\nThese finding prompted the investigator team to use MSC as a fat surrogate and EPCs as an endothelial surrogate to establish a cellular mechanism behind the clinical trial findings. It may also shed light on cross-talk between these two important insulin responsive tissues that contribute towards cardiovascular health.\n\nThe Investigators believe EPC is the ideal cellular vascular outcome biomarker while MSC is the ideal adipocyte health bio-marker. Based on recently published data on saxagliptin's effect on EPC of subjects with Type 2 Diabetes, the investigators are confident that EPC is a robust endothelial marker with quick changes in number, function and gene expression, after appropriate intervention.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to study the effect of a long-acting GLP-1 agonist, over a period of 24 weeks and understand how it influences two different yet related cell types such as endothelium and adipocyte, both of which are key players in insulin resistance/sensitivity in the body.\n\nStudy Hypotheses:\n\nThe investigator hypothesize that GLP1 agonists, like semaglutide, have a positive effect on the EPC number, function, targeted gene expression, arterial stiffness and endothelium specific inflammatory markers.\n\nAdditionally, the investigator hypothesize that semaglutide therapy will reduce adipogenesis and increase bone and cartilage formation by increasing cellular metabolism, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial biogenesis and increased cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR, measured by SeaHorse)."

The autologous MSC-NTF cells are back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the muscles.\n\nNTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.\n\nPrevious open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit were also observed in some patients.\n\nThis multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six months at monthly visits."

There is much interest in MSCs as they have the potential to not only affect the immune system but may also promote repair. This study will use MSCs that are harvested from the bone marrow and grown for up to 52 days before being given back to the person from whom they were harvested. This avoids any chemotherapy so is therefore safer than other types of stem cells. In this crossover study, everyone will receive their own stem cells back but in half of the patients it will be delayed by 24 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcomes are to check that the procedure is safe and to measure any changes on the MRI at 24 weeks. Other more exploratory measures will try to assess effects on repair in the central nervous system (CNS)."

It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

After enrollment patients will be scheduled for amputation 7 days after MSC administration. The investigational treatment uses allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at the point of care. Allogeneic MSCs will be injected in the gastrocnemius muscle and anterior tibialis muscle of twenty-six (26) patients undergoing major amputation. Through a review of treatment related adverse events over 6 months we will test the hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs do not result in significant cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious treatment related adverse events. Through an exploratory investigation we will assess the efficacy of MSCs in promoting freedom from gangrene, revision of amputation, and death after major amputation."

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year."

                              "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of efficacy with disease progression.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype, morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.\n\nBM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes' markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals. Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and practical way for PD."

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic disorder resulting in a functional deficit that usually leads to severe and permanent paralysis. Pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies to SCI get limited effect. Another promising therapeutic approaches for SCI is cellular transplantation. Cell types used in SCI therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in SCI treatment.\n\nMSC have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing ,axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression.\n\nThe clinical translation of cellular transplantation strategies requires a safe and efficient means of cellular delivery. In animal models of SCI, the most common delivery is direct injection into the injury site, which allows a defined number of cells to be delivered, but risks further injuring the cord. Less invasive methods for cell delivery have been investigated, including intravascular delivery (intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial) and delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal). These minimally-invasive techniques decrease the risk to the patient and allow delivery of multiple cell doses. Maybe intrathecal administration is superior to IV delivery, cell engraftment and tissue sparing were significantly better after intrathecal delivery, but more researches are needed for get conclusion."

                              "Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN< 0.2 \u00d7 109/L). Patients with nSAA can be offered supportive care, anabolic steroids, and/or low-dose steroids or cyclosporine (CsA).Patients with SAA and vSAA can be offered immunosuppressive treatment involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). However, some nSAA patients remains dependent to transfusion, the treatment response with ATG for SAA is at best between 50-60%,30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment, they also do not have a HLA-matched donor for bone marrow transplantation. These patients have a high risk of dying without additional treatment. Since the prognosis of these refractory and relapsed AA patients remains poor, there is a need for more safe and effective therapy that can improve response rates and remission duration in refractory and relapsed AA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are part of the bone marrow stem cells repertoire. The main role of MSCs is to support hematopoiesis. Recently, significant interactions between MSCs and cells from the immune system have been demonstrated:MSCs were found to downregulate T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK) and antigen presenting cells through various mechanisms, including cell-to-cell interaction and soluble factor production. MSCs can fully suppress T cell function which involves some degree of MSC activation or 'licensing' thought to involve interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in conjunction with IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or tumour necrosis factor-a. Non-specific suppression of T cell proliferation is mediated by soluble factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide, haem oxygenase products and insulin-like growth factor binding protein. Since the haematopoietic support and immunomodulatory effects, bone marrow-derived human MSCs transplantation maybe a safe novel therapeutic approach for patients with refractory and relapsed AA."

The LOC of the talus can appear after one (or repeated) traumatic injury, compromises the bone and adjacent cartilage, being able to cause blisters in the cartilage layers, lesions similar to a cyst within the bone under the cartilage, or fracture of the cartilage and the bony layers.\n\nThe ankle joint supports multiple loads of the corporal weight in the daily activities, the reason why the properties of the cartilage in the ankle are different from those that appear in the hip and the knee. In the absence of an injury, the cartilage of the ankle has better resistance and tension properties to face the increase of forces than the hip or knee throughout life.\n\nHowever, once an injury appears, the cartilage of the ankle appears to have less repair capacity compared to the hip or knee. Since the most common cause of LOC of the talus is post-traumatic, the average age of these patients is comparatively lower than that of patients affected by injuries to other joints.\n\nOsteochondral injuries have an incidence of 27 per 10,0000 inhabitants in the USA. They are injuries that usually affect the working population and active sportsperson, producing pain, functional limitation and that probably contribute towards the evolution of an accelerated joint degeneration. Currently, there are multiple treatment modalities used by ankle and foot surgeons. These include debridement and microfractures of the subchondral plaque, utilization of totipotential cells, osteochondral autograft/allograft, tibiotalar arthrodesis, and partial/total ankle arthroplasty. However, no treatment offers a clear superiority over the others.\n\nDebridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically is the most frequently used procedure and involves; the removal of degenerated cartilage and subchondral bone; obtaining firm lesional edges that prevent the spread of the lesion; and finally the stimulation of the bone marrow talar by performing microfractures of the subchondral plate. This with the hope that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Although this fibrocartilage has histological characteristics different from those of native articular cartilage, good results have been reported in 82% of the cases when combining good quality studies in this regard.\n\nThe standard technique is not able to generate a replacement articular cartilage strong enough to support the joint loads to which the ankle is exposed. Therefore, clinical trials seek to increase the traditional treatment of debridement and microfractures with the intra-articular use of totipotent cells at the end of the procedure. Although the results of these series are promising and comparable at least to those of traditional treatment, the absence of comparative studies between them complicates the choice of treatment for both the patient and the surgeon. For this reason, the investigators have designed a prospective, comparative, double-blind study that will allow elucidating which of these interventions is the best alternative for our patients.\n\nGeneral Objective:\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogenic stromal mesenchymal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nTo compare functional and radiological results before versus post-surgery within each group studied (control and experimental)\nTo compare functional results after surgery of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\nTo compare the quality of repair of the tissues of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\n\nWork hypothesis:\n\nThe augmentation treatment of the osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal cells produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with only debridement and microfractures."

There are no effective therapies to treat secondary brain injury and the post-injury response of CNS apoptosis and neuroinflammation. Pre-clinical and Phase I clinical progenitor cell therapies have shown promise in TBI/stroke via (1) promotion of CNS structural preservation, and (2) reducing the neuroinflammatory response to injury.\n\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, Bayesian CRM dose-escalation placebo-controlled study designed to treat severe, acute TBI in adult patients with an IV infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells. 55 adult TBI patients will be randomized to receive a single IV infusion of BMMNs (6 x 10^6 or 9 x 10^6) or placebo.\n\nStudy subjects will be consecutive admissions of adults with severe TBI meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adults, ages 18-55 years, hospitalized at Memorial Hermann Hospital (Houston, Texas) for severe TBI (GCS 3-8) will be screened for eligibility. Informed consent, the bone marrow/sham harvest, and stem cell/placebo infusion must take place within 48 hours of the initial injury.\n\nFollowing consent and baseline procedures, subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio (using permuted blocks and stratified by GCS of 3-4 or 5-8) to autologous BMMNC infusion (n=33) and placebo (n = 22), respectively. Administration will begin with the lowest dose (i.e. 6 x 10^6 cells/kg body weight) with each dose given to cohorts of 3 subjects treated with BMMNC (note: the cohort size refers only to subjects treated with autologous BMMNC). After each cohort of 3 subjects treated with autologous BMMNC infusion (accumulated on average after every 5.5 adults randomized), the dosage for the next cohort of 3 autologous BMMNC-treated subjects will be determined by the CRM based on the findings for all subjects previously treated and the prior probabilities of the likelihood of toxicity assigned by the investigators before starting the study. At all doses, the algorithm is designed to avoid administering doses that will have a p(toxicity) exceeding 0.15.\n\nSubjects will be monitored closely for infusion related toxicity and complications during the first 14 days post-infusion while also receiving the usual standard of care for traumatic brain injury . Safety and outcome assessments will be performed at 1, 6, and 12 months post-injury study visits."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) is the treatment of choice for many malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders. However, this treatment is frequently complicated by acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD), wich can be associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\nSteroids are still the first line treatment for established aGVHD, with a response rate of 30-50%, and there is no established and effective therapy for severe steroid-refractory aGVHD. The outcome for patients is poor and overall survival low, with few patients alive at 2 years.\n\nIn the case of failure after corticosteroid treatment, different therapeutic options have been introduced as second or third-line strategies. In this scenario, infusion of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has emerged as an additional tool for treatment of GVHD.\n\nMSCs are non hematopoietic multipotent cells with self-renewal properties and the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues. Several lines of evidence in the past few years have confirmed the ability of theses cells differentiate into cells derived form embryonic mesoderm, such as osteocytes, adipocytes and chondroblasts. In vitro, culture-expanded MSCs express membrane antigens that can be immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The most widely accepted antigen expression pattern is cluster of differentiation (CD) 29, CD105, CD73, and CD90 positivity in 97 % of cells and minimal expression of CD45, CD34, CD3, CD14, CD19, or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR, which should be positive in less than 3 % of cells.\n\nBecause they are easy to isolate and culture and due to their differentiation potential and production of growth factors and cytokines, MSC have become ideal candidates for regenerative protocols.\n\nThe purpose of this work is conduct a study in patients with refractory and/or resistant GVHD corticosteroids treatment. It will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive the MSCs and the other group will follow the acute GVHD steroid-resistant and/or refractory treatment according to the routines of the Bone Marrow Transplantation service of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. It will be evaluated aspects of immune recovery early after MSCs infusion.\n\nMETHOD: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open label study to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatment of steroid-resistant acute GVHD with MSC. All patients with refractory and/or resistant steroids GVHD will be included after signing of free and informed consent.\n\nAfter randomization, patients will be allocated to receive conventional treatment:\n\nBasiliximab 20mg dose for adults and 10mg for children, 1 time a week or every 3 days if worsens the stage of GVHD until reaching Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or for a maximum of 4 doses, whichever comes first.\nIf after the item (1) will not obtained VGPR: Infliximab 5 to 10 mg/kg dose, 1 time a week, four weeks or even VGPR.\n\nPatients in the study group will receive two infusions of MSC per week during two weeks and 1 more MSC infusion (2 + 2 + 1 scheme).\n\nAfter 28 days, if VGPR is not obtained, crossover between groups will be allowed as well as for the patients with progressive GVHD in spit of treatment arm, before day +28. The latter group of patients, who use both treatments (MSC + Conventional treatment) before day + 28 will be analyzed separately.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived MSCs from normal BMT donors (third part) will be isolated and expanded under conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice. The quality control involves immunophenotyping, differentiation, microbiological control, mycoplasma and endotoxin tests.\n\nPatients response evaluation will be at Day + 28:\n\nComplete response: disappearance of all symptoms\nPartial response: with a decrease at least of one degree of GVHD\nVGPR: decrease to the stage I of GVHD\nStable disease: when there is a stability of the disease\nNumber and type of infection in the first 100 days after transplant\n\nThe transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, overall survival and the development of chronic GVHD or not, will also be evaluated."

                              "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) refers to the clinicopathological synthesis of lymphocytes from the donor attacking the recipient's organs during the process of rebuilding the donor's immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) Signs (including classic cGVHD and overlap syndrome) are one of the main complications after transplantation, with an incidence of 30% to 70%. cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. main reason. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 \u00b1 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points) About 84.9 \u00b1 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 \u00b1 4.4%, rRG4 (\u226510 points) about 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT patients.\n\nOnce moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time, which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment of cGVHD.\n\nIn 2002, Frassoni reported for the first time that MSCs expanded in vitro were used to evaluate the efficacy of allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT transplanted patients with hematological malignancies were enrolled. MSCs were derived from the donor's bone marrow. After expanded in vitro, participants were combined with the donor's hematopoietic stem cells for reinfusion. As a result, the incidence of aGVHD in the MSCs expansion group and cGVHD within 6 months was significantly lower in the control group, the 6-month OS was significantly higher than that in the control group, and there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate. Subsequently, in 2004, Le Blanc and others successfully used third-party MSCs to successfully treat a refractory grade IV intestinal combined with liver aGVHD for the first time. Subsequently, MSCs were increasingly used in clinical studies for the treatment of GVHD. More clinical trials have shown that umbilical cord-derived MSCs cultured in vitro can not only promote the implantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), but also reduce the incidence of severe GVHD in patients, showing a good therapeutic effect."

                              "The role of regenerative therapies has gained more importance due to increased number of SCI in the wake of recent anti-terrorism operations by the armed forces and non-availability of any curative treatment for this category of patients. The promising results of preliminary clinical trials have proved that adult stem cells especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells can be safely injected and well tolerated and have shown functional improvement in SCI patients. The successful treatment in these patients will not only improve functional status of these otherwise debilitating patients, but can also reduce the burden on health care facilities. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression. In this study patients suffering from sub-acute and chronic phase of spinal cord injury shall be included. Patients will undergo detailed screening through MRI and motor and sensory assessment by ASIA score. Further evaluation will include electromyography (EMG) and tests for electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) will also be done. Bone marrow aspiration will be done from iliac crest of the patients, followed by mononuclear cells (MNCs) separation by density gradient centrifugation. MNCs will be washed and cultured in tissue culture flasks. After 48 hours non-adherent cells will be removed from culture. Medium will be changed twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence. At that point MSCs will be harvested and after microbiological and other quality control testing the cellular preparation will be diluted to final concentration and infused by intrathecal injection.\n\nPrimary outcome measure is safety which will be determined by clinical evaluation by two independent neurologists during one month of hospital stay after receiving treatment course.\n\nSecondary outcome measures will include American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and NCV/EMG."

                              "COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries worldwide. Globally, as of 1:09 pm CEST, 27 July 2020, there have been 16 096 741 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 646 384 deaths, reported to WHO.\n\nThe main and rapidly achievable target of SARS-CoV-2 is lung type II alveolar cells (AT2), which determines the development of diffuse alveolar damage. In the pathogenesis of ARDS due to COVID-19, the main role is played by an over-response of the immune system with rapidly developing severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm). Cytokine release syndrome threatens the emergence and progression of ARDS. The key components of the pathogenesis of ARDS also include disruption of cell cytotoxicity mechanisms, excessive activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and macrophages with a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines (FNO-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), granulocytic colony-stimulating factor, monocytic chemoattractive protein 1), and inflammatory markers (CRP, serum ferritin), infiltration of internal organs and tissues by activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in a hyperinflammatory reaction. Such severe lesions can lead to death or severe lung damage, including long rehabilitation after discharge.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may significantly reduce lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. Many researchers connect the anti-inflammatory effect of MSC with their secretome which includes MSC derived exosomes. It is highly likely that MSC exosomes have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves. Moreover, exosomes show a strong effect of regenerative stimulation on different wounds so the regenerative effect can be extended on patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."

                              "COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries worldwide. Globally, as of 1:09 pm CEST, 27 July 2020, there have been 16 096 741 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 646 384 deaths, reported to WHO.\n\nThe main and rapidly achievable target of SARS-CoV-2 is lung type II alveolar cells (AT2), which determines the development of diffuse alveolar damage. In the pathogenesis of ARDS due to COVID-19, the main role is played by an over-response of the immune system with rapidly developing severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm). Cytokine release syndrome threatens the emergence and progression of ARDS. The key components of the pathogenesis of ARDS also include disruption of cell cytotoxicity mechanisms, excessive activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and macrophages with a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines (FNO-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), granulocytic colony-stimulating factor, monocytic chemoattractive protein 1), and inflammatory markers (CRP, serum ferritin), infiltration of internal organs and tissues by activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in a hyperinflammatory reaction. Such severe lesions can lead to death or severe lung damage, including long rehabilitation after discharge.\n\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may significantly reduce lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. Many researchers connect the anti-inflammatory effect of MSC with their secretome which includes MSC derived exosomes. It is highly likely that MSC exosomes have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves. Moreover, exosomes show a strong effect of regenerative stimulation on different wounds so the regenerative effect can be extended on patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."

                              "The administration of the tranexamic acid (TRAXA), an antifibrinolytic, blocks primary fibrinolysis, and thus the haemorrhage, in the early postoperative period. Significant surgical operations, as well as trauma, initiate a similar dynamic homeostatic mechanism between the creation of a clot (primary and secondary haemostasis) and its dissolution (fibrinolysis). Antifibrinolytics are initially used in patients with an accelerated fibrinolysis of different pathogeneses. However, they have been proven effective in reducing haemorrhage in patients who have undergone significant surgical operations with normal fibrinolysis, with the use of an appropriate surgical technique.\n\nA pharmacokinetic study has shown that peak fibrinolytic activity is present for 6 hours after the incision and it persists for 18 hours in total knee and hip arthroplasty. The administration of the tranexamic acid in optional orthopaedic surgery of total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty reduces the postoperative haemorrhage, as well as the number and volume of the postoperative autologous blood.\n\nA randomized, placebo-controlled trial CRAS-2 has validated that the early post-traumatic administration of the tranexamic acid, within 8 hours after the injury, in adult patients with traumas or in patients with the risk of significant haemorrhage, reduces the fatality rate.\n\nThe tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of lysine, an amino acid which blocks lysine binding sites of the plasminogen molecule which are essential for its biding to fibrin. This mechanism inhibits the plasminogen activation via a plasminogen activator which also binds to fibrin. Thus, it prevents the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, which is essential for fibrin dissolution, the integral element of a stable clot. The second important antifibrinolytic effect is blocking the lysine binding sites on the free plasmin molecule which has already been formed through the conversion from the plasminogen. This inhibits its binding to fibrin, and the TRAXA-plasmin complex is rapidly inactivated with the \u03b1-2-antiplasmin and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin. Biological half-life is approximately 2-3 hours.\n\nA trauma in the organism triggers the immunologic response. The initial immunologic reaction occurs at the location of the injury, and it is called an inflammation. The inflammatory response is characterized by a complex interaction of macrophages (a type of leukocytes which develop from monocytes and are a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, the main task of which are phagocytosis, i.e. the clearance of foreign materiel from the organism, performing the immunologic function - the defence against foreign materiel - antigens, and the regulation of the inflammation via interleukins which they secrete - IL1, IL-2,TNF) and dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells), the consequence of which is the release of cytokines (interleukins - glycoproteins which regulate interactions among cells) and chemokine (small proteins from the cytokine group - able to induce chemotaxis, cell migration), and the activation of the neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (cells not containing any information, located in the adipose tissue, cartilage and muscle tissue).\n\nIf the initial inflammatory response at the location of the injury is strong enough, it will develop into a systemic inflammatory response, called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which implies an inflammatory response of the entire body without a proven source of infection. The criteria for the diagnosis of the SIRS are: heart rate higher than 90 bpm; body temperature lower than 36\u00b0C or higher than 38\u00b0C; tachypnoea, respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths per minute or the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood lower than 4.3 kPa (32 mm Hg); the number of white blood cells, leukocytes, lower than 4.000 cells in 1 mm\u00b3 or higher than 12.000 cells in 1 mm\u00b3; or the presence of more than 10% of immature neutrophils. A destructive immunologic inflammatory cascade can prevent or delay healing.\n\nAt the same time the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) is initiated, which includes the immunologic response with the aim of re-establishing the immunologic homeostasis. It is characterized by: a reduced cytokine response of monocytes to the stimulation; a reduced number of antigen-presenting receptors (human leukocyte antigens or HLA) on monocytes; an increased level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine; lymphocyte apoptosis (T-cells); lymphocyte dysfunction, i.e. reduced proliferation; reduced Th1 proinflammatory cytokine production (a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by the regulatory T lymphocytes). It clinically manifests as skin allergy, hypothermia and leukopenia. Additional criteria include elevated levels of C-reactive proteins, lactates and hyperglycaemia. If the immunosuppressive response persists, it may increase the possibility of an infection occurring, and the inability to defend against the infection, which may result in the development of sepsis, multiple organ failure and death.\n\nDue to the wide clinical and laboratory criteria which both the SIRS and CARS terms include, they are not the best terms for describing the immunologic response to a trauma, and a new term has been introduced - the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI), characterised by: a change on the immunologic cells (neutrophilia, monocytosis, increased number of mesenchymal stromal cells, reduced expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells, increased lymphocyte apoptosis, a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by Treg lymphocytes - CD4+CD25+CD127-); a change in production levels of various cytokines (anti-inflammatory cytokines): IL-10, IL-4; anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine: IL-6; pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3); the activation of the complement system (C5a and C3a via factor VII - tissue factor system, activated by cell damage).\n\nPost-traumatic immunosuppression can be made worse by transfusion, haemorrhage, stress, significant surgical operation and immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nThe research has shown that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).\n\nThe normal function of Treg lymphocytes is the suppression of the T-cell response against its own antigens.\n\nStopping haemorrhage prevents the occurrence of anaemia, as well as the need for transfusion of blood products, which lead to developing the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI).\n\nMonitoring the immunologic status of patients with the understanding of the PTI mechanism can enable timely and individual modulation of the immunologic status with pre-planned procedures (preventing haemorrhage, anaemia, avoiding transfusion) and/or immunotherapy (drugs and nutrients), and thereby prevent the occurrence of complications, such as infections. Infections may result in sepsis and multiple-organ failure, and eventually be lethal for the patient.\n\nThe research has proved that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).\n\nThe normal function of Treg lymphocytes is the suppression of the T-cell response against its own antigens.\n\nThere are two main types of regulatory lymphocytes: natural Treg, which are mostly developed in the thymus, and inducible Treg, which arise in the periphery after being exposed to cytokines, antigen-presenting cells or immunosuppressive drugs. It may be difficult to differentiate these two lymphocyte Treg populations in vivo. Nevertheless, it is known that different stages of the infection require different regulations. Acute infection, tissue damage, inflammation caused by the innate immunologic response is limited, i.e. locally controlled via natural Treg lymphocytes. This mechanism triggers the activation of inducible Treg lymphocytes.\n\nFor the first time, in 1995, it was described that the suppression of CD4+ T-lymphocytes is caused by a low T-cell population with the CD4+ CD25+ expression. Natural Treg lymphocytes, apart from belonging to CD4+ T-cell population, have a CD25+ receptor, an \u03b1-receptor chain for IL-2, and a receptor for the cytotoxic T-lymphocytic antigen 4 (CTLA 4), the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNF), but it differs from the activated T-cells by the expression of the transcription factor FoxP3 (transcription factor encoded with the FoxP3 gene). The expression of CD 127lo, an \u03b1-chain receptor for the interleukin 7 enables us to differentiate Treg lymphocytes from the activated T-lymphocytes via flow cytometry. The number of CD25+CD127lo cells correlates to the number of CD25+FoxP3+ cells in the peripheral blood.\n\nDifferent studies show that the application of the 3-colour flow cytometry shows small variation in the percentage of Treg lymphocytes in the peripheral blood from 6.35% to 8.34%.\n\nThere is a number of different mechanisms which achieve regulation by using the Treg lymphocytes: the long-term interaction with dendritic cells (DC), thereby modulating the function of antigen-presenting cells (APC), the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 and the CTLA4 expression on Treg cells which induces the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in APC which degrade the amino acid tryptophan, the lack of which inhibits the activation of T-cells and induces T-cell apoptosis. Treg lymphocytes also induce the apoptosis of monocytes and affect the lower expression of HLA-DR on monocytes whereby they directly affect the innate immunological response.\n\nElevated, suppressive activity of Treg cells in traumas prevents the protective Th1 response for up to 7 days in comparison with the healthy population."

                              "The study aims at studying the involvement of MIF in adult AML.\n\n1. DESCRIPTION OF THE ELEMENT OR ELEMENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION 1.1. Measurement of MIF concentrations Plasma and BM supernatant from patients and controls (100 age-matched controls for blood and BM plasma, available at Tours Hospital, ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02789839 ) will be analyzed by ELISA. BM supernatants will be obtained after a 2-step centrifugation procedure: 1 mL of fresh BM from AML patients or control BM will be centrifuged at 540 g for 5 min to recover viable cells in the pellet (for cytometric and expression studies); the supernatant will be centrifuged at 1000 g/15 min/4\u00b0C to prepare the plasma. MIF concentrations in BM and blood plasma will be systematically compared. As MIF concentrations may be affected by different factors, including inflammation, leukocytosis, and monocytosis, blood cell counts and plasma C-reactive protein levels will be measured and taken into account in the interpretation of the data.\n\n1.2. Measurement of MIF, CD74, and CXCR4 expression Hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and blasts from AML patients will be sorted according to the expression of CD34, CD38, CD90, CD45-RA, IL-3R antigens, taking into account the initial immunophenotype of the disease. Hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from control BM samples will be sorted similarly. MIF, CD74 and CXCR4 RNA expression will be studied by quantitative RT-PCR in sorted cell subpopulations. The surface expression of CXCR4 and anti-CD74 as well as intracellular CD74 will be studied by multiparametric flow with cytometry.\n\n1.3. Analysis of MIF, CD74, CXCR4 expression, and MIF concentrations at time of complete remission.\n\nThe analyses performed in a) and b) will be repeated in complete remission samples in 30 to 50 selected patients. Patients will be selected according to their response to therapy (assessment of complete remission and normal blood counts), and to the genotype of their disease (15-25 patients with either TET2 or DNMT3A mutations at diagnosis vs 15-25 patients without these mutations). Samples will be collected after two chemotherapy courses at time of remission evaluation. Whenever possible, bone marrow controls of patients in long term remission (> 1 year post diagnosis) will be collected and studied. In the meantime, NGS, ddPCR, FISH or RT-PCR techniques will be used to assess the persistence or absence of the initial AML lesions.\n\nIt is expected that complete material will be obtained for 80% of included patients making the objective of 240 patients achievable in less than three years. Cell purification may be an issue in the context of AML with aberrant immunophenotype: this will be taken into account by the use of appropriate FACS protocols. Regarding the focus on MIF pathway, it cannot rule out that other chemokines/cytokines, or others molecules may be involved in the communication of AML cells and their micro-environment. Thus, aliquots of BM and blood plasma will be cryopreserved to allow a refinement of our strategy (for example to perform cytokine arrays, ELISA, or MS analyses which are available at Saint-Antoine Hospital).\n\n1.4. Xenotransplantation model of primary AML in NSG mice Xenotransplantation models of primary AML cells has been developed in a cohort of 70 AMLs in which MIF expression will be analysed, the cytogenetic and molecular genotype, and correlate these parameters to different engrafting phenotypes.\n\n1.5. MIF inhibition in NSG mice transplanted with AML cells and in NSG mice transplanted with TET2-depleted or DNMT3A-depleted cord blood HSPCs The role of MIF on leukemia development in NSG mice xenotransplanted with primary cells will be accessed. In these experiments, primary AML patient cells from 6 patients with TET2 mutations of our cohort that engraft will be used to generate leukemia. When leukemic development will be seen in blood (between 8 to 10 weeks), MIF expression will be measured in the serum of mice. Mice will be randomized into three groups with 7 mice per group: One group will be treated with a commercially available MIF inhibitor (ISO-1) and a second group with an anti MIF antibody and one group will be treated by the vehicle for three weeks (one injection a week). Mice will then be monitored to detect pre-leukemic engraftment and AML development using weekly blood sampling and anti-human CD45 staining.\n\nA model of xenotransplantation by cord blood CD34+ cells transduced with lentivectors expressing TET2 shRNAs have been developed. These engineered CD34 positive cells showed increased MIF expression and secretion and demonstrate enhanced multilineage NSG engraftment. Il will be tested whether inhibition of MIF using MIF inhibitor or anti MIF antibody leads to a correction of the enhanced multilineage NSG engraftment by TET2-depleted cells when compared to control cells. Similar experiments will be performed with a DNMT3A-depleted model using DNMT3A shRNAs that are currently available in the laboratory. In addition, the effects of MIF inhibition (inhibitor and antibody) and recombinant human MIF will be analyzed in NSG repopulation assays of unprocessed normal cord blood CD34+ cells.\n\n1.6. MIF inhibition in NSG mice transplanted with cells from patients in complete remission with persistent clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A / TET2 mutant) Complete remission samples from six patients with persistent clonal hematopoiesis in complete remission will be selected and treated as in a) to test whether MIF inhibition is also able to counteract NSG repopulation by residual pre-leukemic stem cells.\n\nIt is expected that MIF inhibition will impair AML development in mice. However, stability and side effects of anti MIF antibody or inhibitors may be an issue in treated animals. In this case, shRNAs will be used to knock-down MIF in AML cells before injection to NSG mice. Another issue may be the need for co-injection of MSCs at time of xenotransplantation to increase the relevance of the model. If needed, normal MSCs and AML MSCs will be collected, prepared, and co-injected with AML cells.\n\n1.7. Full characterization of the up-regulation of MIF in TET2 depleted cells How TET2 might impact gene regulation remains still not completely understood. Recently, Cao X's team has shown that loss of Tet2 resulted in the upregulation of several inflammatory mediators. In this model, Tet2 recruited Hdac2 and repressed transcription of Il6 via histone deacetylation. It has been found that TET2 binds the proximal promoter of MIF gene which is enriched in CpG islands in Kasumi cells. Loss of TET2 results in MIF accumulation in several leukemic models through EGR1. i) MIF promoter methylation will be analyzed by sequencing after bisulfite treatment in normal CD34+ cells (20 samples) and cell populations from AMLs sorted as in c)(150 samples) ii) EGR1 mRNA expression will be analyzed by qRT-PCR in normal and AML pre-leukemic stem cells to see if there is a correlation with MIF expression as observed in other models iii) ChIP-PCR analyses focusing on MIF promoter will be performed for EGR1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and HDAC2 in control and AML patient samples. If EGR1 is not involved in this system, MIF promoter luciferase assay will be used to identify transcription factor sites that are essential for its up-regulation in AML samples and validate the targets by ChIP-PCR. All these technologies are available.\n\n1.8. bidirectional communication between MSCs and AML cells or normal HSPCs The impact of MIF overexpression in AML cells will be tested on the physiology of normal MSCs (differentiation, sustain of hematopoiesis, production of cytokines / chemokines, interactome). For this aim, normal primary MSCs from adult bone marrow (already available) will be isolated and expanded as described (Reinisch A et al, Blood 2015, 125:249-260). The Cells will be amplified up to passage 2 (P2). MSCs will be treated with different concentrations of recombinant MIF for 24 and 48 hours and the proliferation, production of cytokines/ chemokines will be evaluated. As it has been reported that MIF stimulates glycolysis, the effects of MIF will also decipher will be also deciphered in the energetic metabolism of MSCs by measuring mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis of MSCs (Seahorse XF extracellular flux analyzer) and by determining their MIF-induced metabolic signature using high throughput multiplexed fingerprinting (Omnilog Biolog). To model the effects of MIF overexpression by AML cells, will perform co-culture experiments between human primary AML cells (5 samples) that express or not (shRNA) of MIF. After 24 and 48 hours, MSCs will be sorted and their proliferation, cell cycle and differentiation potential into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes will be evaluated. Previous studies indicate that MIF-CXCR4 is a novel axis for MSC recruitment to tumors in vivo.\n\nThus it will be studied whether recombinant MIF may recruit MSCs using in vitro transwell assays. Effect of MIF production by AML cells on MSCs recruitment will be tested using AML conditioned medium. AML cells engineered with MIF shRNA will be used in this context. As it cannot rule out that MSCs may also contribute to MIF production, mRNA expression will be tested by primary normal MSC cocultured with AML cells.\n\nIt is expected that recombinant MIF will have an impact on either proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation potential or migration of MSCs. However, MIF produced in BM microenvironment could also modify the biology of other populations of the stem cell niche including osteoblasts, endothelial cells or macrophages. To investigate alternative cells on which MIF may have an impact, it will be test its effects on these populations. MSCs will be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes or chondrocytes. MIF will then be added to investigate proliferation, cell cycle and migration of populations of interest. Effect on osteoblasts and endothelial cells will be modelized using MG63 and Huvec cell lines, respectively.\n\n1.9. Study population 1.9.1. Participant recruitment 300 adult patients (>18) newly diagnosed with AML will be included in the study. 85 patients diagnosed since novembe 2015 at Saint-Antoine Hospital will be retrospectively included in the study. 215 patients newly diagnosed with AML at Saint-Antoine and Tours University hospitals will be prospectively included [>100 AML patients per year are referred to Saint-Antoine hospital (>70 patients per year) and Tours University Hospital for AML (>30 patients per year)].\n\n1.9.2.

Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation) caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such, therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes hyperinflammation due to \"cytokine storm\" and \"chemokine storm,\" tissue damage, hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.\n\nThe mechanism of fatal pneumonia in experimental murine coronavirus infection is mediated by innate inflammasome activation, a resultant robust infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, and a subsequent increase in multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Importantly, the CD4+ and CD8+ adaptive T cell response to experimental coronavirus infection can be either curative or disease propagating. Viral-induced pulmonary inflammation has also been evaluated in non-human primate models, which have confirmed that dysregulated immune activation during viral pneumonia involves T cell subset imbalance, a downstream monocyte-derived inflammatory cascade, and resultant epithelial cell injury. In humans, severity of viral-induced lower respiratory tract infection correlates with increased numbers of effector memory CD8+ T cells in the airway. As recently reviewed, human coronavirus infection represents an ongoing battle between virus and host, with the nature of the response dictating disease cure or alternatively, aggravated lung disease. Evidence exists that the adaptive immune system contributes to pulmonary inflammation during SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease: that is, bronchoalveolar fluid from such subjects had increased T cell numbers and increased Th1-associated molecules IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IP-10. This downstream adaptive T cell-mediated inflammatory response is driven in part by the SARS-Co-V protein viroporin 3a. Specifically, viroporin molecules activate the NLRP3 inflammasome that links innate-to-adaptive inflammatory responses. Furthermore, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 express an open-reading-frame ORF3a molecule, which also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nThe nature of immunity during resolution of symptomatic COVID-19 infection has recently been reported, namely: emergence of antibody-secreting cells and CD4+ T follicular helper cells; increase in perforin- and granzyme-expressing CD8+ T cells; and relative lack of an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In marked contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 disease had greatly increased plasma levels of cytokines (including IL-2 and TNF-alpha) and chemokines (including IP-10 and MIP-1-alpha) (Huang et al., Lancet, 2020). Collectively, these results indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses that occur in severe COVID-19 is detrimental and that effective anti-inflammatory approaches may ultimately prove to be therapeutic. However, as previously detailed, the more advanced Stage 3 COVID-19 disease is characterized by an ARDS component, and cytokine storm, as such, novel approaches to treat the COVID-19 viral pneumonia should optimally incorporate both an anti-inflammatory element and a tissue protection/tissue repair element.\n\nStage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6 therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3 COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.\n\nRAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are \"reprogrammed\" ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a \"hybrid\" product. The hybrid phenotype inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of Stage 3 COVID-19-related ARDS.\n\nIn general, classical autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and viral-induced inflammatory disease are driven by predominance of Th1/Th17-type responses with a relative insufficiency of the counter-regulatory immune suppressive Th2 and TREG subsets. TREG cells, which are defined in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor, have been extensively studied in experimental models for their capacity to modulate autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and transplantation complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. Importantly, T cell production of IL-2 or exogenous IL-2 administration drives lung inflammation during experimental viral infection; therefore, given the known role of TREG cells as a consumer of IL-2, there is a strong mechanistic rationale for a beneficial contribution of TREG cells during viral-driven lung inflammation. Furthermore, in an experimental murine models of virus-induced lung inflammation and lung injury, interventions that augmented TREG cell number and function accelerated the repair of lung injury. And, Th2 cells, which are defined in part by their expression of GATA3 transcription factor, were described thirty years ago as a powerful counter-regulatory population to prevent Th1 cell predominance. It is important to note that clinical data indicates that maneuvers that increase immune suppressive cell populations, including TREG cells, can reduce severe inflammatory disease such as graft-versus-host disease without impairing anti-viral immunity. In addition, in both experimental models and clinical studies, an appropriate level of TREG cells can result in an overall improvement in pulmonary inflammation during viral bronchiolitis. Collectively, these findings indicate that T cells expressing a combined TREG/Th2 phenotype would predictably yield beneficial effects in the setting of viral-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury associated with severe Stage 3 COVID-19 disease.\n\nClinical trials have evaluated both TREG and Th2-type cells for various conditions, most prominently transplantation complications. In general, thymic-derived natural (n)TREG cells are thought to express a more stable phenotype than post-thymic induced (i)TREG cells; by comparison, iTREG cells can mediate more potent suppression. Nonetheless, both nTREG and iTREG cells are susceptible to differentiation plasticity, which creates concern that a potentially therapeutic TREG population might convert to pathogenic Th1/Th17 phenotypes in vivo. Ex vivo expanded (n)TREG cells were evaluated in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using cord blood donors; more recently, the same research group has developed ex vivo expanded (i)TREG cell therapy to limit transplant complications. In addition, ex vivo expanded nTREG cells have been evaluated in the setting of type I diabetes mellitus; this clinical trial found that TREG therapy was safe and at least transiently effective in improving disease control. Furthermore, in the setting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a disease propagated by a severe Th1-driven peripheral and central inflammatory response, a clinical trial of nTREG cell adoptive transfer identified that the intervention was safe and showed promise in terms of ALS disease amelioration. Finally, in a phase II study of rapamycin-resistant Th2 cell therapy in the setting of low-intensity allogeneic HCT, adoptive Th2 cell transfer was safe and associated with a shift towards Th2 polarization in vivo, preservation of donor engraftment, stabilization of mixed chimerism, a low rate of GVHD, and potent anti-tumor effects in patients with refractory hematologic malignancy. Collectively, these clinical trial results indicate that the adoptive transfer of TREG and Th2-type populations can be safely administered, even in the allogeneic HCT setting, and can mediate beneficial modulation of inflammatory conditions.\n\nEx vivo manufacturing can be utilized to generate induced (i)TREG cells from the post-thymic pool of peripheral T cells. In the current protocol, the manufacturing method will focus upon mTOR inhibition, which is an established intervention that promotes the induction of TREG cells. In combination with mTOR inhibition, the culture system that is utilized incorporates cytokines that promote both a Th2 and a TREG phenotype, namely, IL-4, TGF-beta, and IL-2. Finally, the protocol will include a TREG/Th2 cell product comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, as these counter-regulatory T cell subsets express differential T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires and a diversity of effector mechanisms that can potentially enhance an anti-inflammatory effect. For RAPA-501 manufacture, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are collected from a steady-state apheresis and subjected to the following two-step culture intervention: in step 1, a severe starvation step results in T cell de-differentiation, which is realized through both selective media utilization and the addition of FDA-approved pharmaceutical agents that potently inhibit mTOR signaling; and in step 2, re-differentiation of T cells occurs using co-stimulation agents and Th2- and TREG-type polarizing cytokines. After 6-days in culture, the resultant TREG/Th2 population is cryopreserved in single-use aliquots at protocol-driven therapeutic doses. T cells of type II cytokine phenotype are characterized in part by their expression of the transcription factor GATA3 whereas regulatory T cell populations are identified in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor. At culture initiation, a very low frequency of T cells express either GATA3 or FOXP3. In contrast, the RAPA-501 cell product manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture conditions expresses a high frequency of T cells that are either single-positive for GATA3, single-positive for FOXP3, or double-positive for both GATA3 and FOXP3. Importantly, this transcription factor profile is expressed in both manufactured CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is important to note that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations with TREG function have been defined, including a CD8+ TREG population that potently suppresses GVHD; it is potentially advantageous to have both subsets represented in a therapeutic product because CD4+ and CD8+ TREG cells utilize differential effector mechanisms.\n\nRegulatory T cell populations can suppress pathogenic effector T cell populations by several defined mechanisms, including through expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidase molecules, which act to hydrolyse pro-inflammatory ATP towards the immune suppressive adenosine substrate . Indeed, TREG cells that express CD39 possess increased suppressive function and have been associated with resolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, suppressive function of human TREG cells is mediated in part by CD73. T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture condition have an increase in expression of the TREG-associated effector molecules, CD39 and CD73. In addition to the CD39/CD73 ectonucleotidases, TREG cell function has also been correlated with expression of CD103, which is an integrin that dictates epithelial lymphocyte localization. Indeed, CD103 and IL-2 receptor signaling cooperate to maintain immune tolerance in the gut mucosa; furthermore, CD103-expressing TREG cells are critical for amelioration of experimental chronic GVHD . T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture condition have increased expression of the TREG effector molecule CD103.\n\nIn experimental models, the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy is dependent upon successful engraftment and in vivo T cell persistence. Importantly, the T cell differentiation state helps dictate in vivo persistence, with less differentiated cells having increased persistence. Murine rapamycin-resistant T cells, which expressed a T central memory (TCM) phenotype, had increased in vivo engraftment potential relative to control T cells. In addition, human rapamycin-resistant T cells also had increased engraftment in a human-into-murine model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. T cells with reduced differentiation relative to the T effector memory (TEM) population have increased in vivo persistence and mediate increased in vivo effects, including the TCM subset, the na\u00efve T cell subset, and more recently, the T stem cell memory (TSCM) subset. This relationship between T cell differentiation status and in vivo T cell function is relevant to TREG cells, as: (1) TREG cells of TCM phenotype were more effective at reducing experimental GVHD relative to TREG cells of TEM phenotype; and (2) TREG cells that expressed the stem cell marker CD150 were highly effective for the prevention of stem cell graft rejection. T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture condition are enriched for cells having a reduced differentiation state consistent with a T stem cell subset, including expression of the CD150 marker.\n\nIt is also important to assess the cytokine secretion profile of the manufactured RAPA-501 cells. First, it is critical that the cell product is capable of IL-4 secretion, which is the driver cytokine for subsequent Th2 differentiation. Second, it is desirable that an adoptively transferred T cell population is capable of secreting IL-2, as this capacity indicates a progenitor function that permits T cells to expand more readily in vivo without the need for exogenous IL-2 . Finally, it is important that the RAPA-501 cell population has reduced secretion of the Th1- or Th17-type cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and GM-CSF. The manufactured RAPA-501 cell product secretes IL-4 and IL-2 with minimal secretion of Th1- or Th17-type cytokines.\n\nRegulatory T cells can also be defined in part by their ability to suppress the proliferation or function of effector T cells. Importantly, manufactured TREG/Th2 cells potently suppress Th1/Tc1 cell secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. To assess the mechanism of suppression, experiments were performed using the transwell assay, whereby effector T cells and RAPA-501 cells are separated by a filter that prevents cell-to-cell contact but allows cell communication by small soluble mediators such as cytokines. RAPA-501 cells acted in a TCR-independent manner to suppress the cytokine secretion capacity of effector T cells. Because no co-stimulation was provided to the transwell chamber containing RAPA-501 cells, RAPA-501 cells did not require co-stimulation to modulate inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. The following cytokines and chemokines were reduced by RAPA-501 cells in this transwell assay, with relatively equal suppression mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of RAPA-501 cells: CCL1, CCL2, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCL26, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, IL-6, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-10. The ability of TREG cells to consume IL-2 is a commonly described phenomenon, although previous studies identified the requirement of cell-to-cell contact for IL-2 consumption. As such, RAPA-501 cells are uniquely capable of modulating the level of multiple inflammatory cytokines in a contact-independent manner. These results suggest that RAPA-501 cells represent a suitable candidate for neutralization of multiple cytokines and chemokines associated with various diseases, including viral-induced lung inflammation. In light of this capacity of the RAPA-501 cell product to suppress T cell-mediated inflammation in a TCR-independent manner, RAPA-501 therapy is highly suitable for allogeneic, off-the-shelf treatment applications.\n\nFurther experiments were performed to evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might also regulate human CNS microglial cells, which are myeloid-derived cells that are analogous to the peripheral monocyte population. To evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might modulate pro-inflammatory microglial cells in a contact-independent manner, the ability of RAPA-501 cells to reduce the inflammatory state of the microglial cell line HMC3 was tested in a transwell assay. RAPA-501 cells reduced the HMC3 cell secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma and the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 at the relatively low ratio of RAPA-501 cells to microglial cells of 1:40. These results demonstrate that the RAPA-501 product is capable of inhibiting cytokine and chemokine secretion from myeloid-derived populations in a contact- and TCR-independent manner, thereby providing a further rationale for allogeneic, off-the-shelf utilization of the RAPA-501 product.\n\nRAPA-501 cell product for stability of T cell phenotype was also evaluated. That is, it has been determined that a limiting factor of TREG cell therapy may be differentiation plasticity, for example, whereby TREG cells can be influenced by inflammatory cytokines to lose their TREG characteristics and adopt a Th1-type inflammatory state, which may then promote disease pathogenesis. To address this possibility, the RAPA-501 cell capacity to modulate T cell differentiation transcription factors after an extended culture interval that involved T cell co-stimulation, the absence of mTOR inhibitors, and the presence of the polarizing inflammatory cytokines IFN-alpha and IL-6 was studied. These experiments demonstrated that the RAPA-501 cell product had remarkable differentiation stability (continued expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; lack of up-regulation of TBET).\n\nIn summary, RAPA-501 cells express a phenotype consistent with a regulatory T cell population, including: stable expression of the TREG and Th2 transcription factors FOXP3 and GATA3; expression of the TREG functional molecules CD39, CD73, and CD103; expression of a reduced state of T cell differentiation, including expression of the stem cell marker CD150; secretion of a Th2 pattern of cytokines with minimal secretion of Th1/Th17-type cytokines; functional suppressive capacity against both effector Th1/Tc1 cells and pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, including reduced levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; and a capacity to inhibit inflammatory effectors in a contact- and TCR-independent manner. Collectively, these characteristics of the RAPA-501 product predicts that this therapy represents a novel and promising candidate to treat COVID-19-related ARDS.\n\nThis is a first-in-human phase 1/phase 2b study evaluating allogeneic RAPA-501 cell therapy in participants with COVID-19-related ARDS. Two phase 1 cohorts will be evaluated, namely, a low-dose Cohort 1 (40 x 10^6 cells/infusion) and a high-dose Cohort 2 (160 x 10^6 cells/infusion); this phase 1 component will utilize dose-limiting-toxicity (DLT) as a primary endpoint. Provided that safety is demonstrated in the phase 1 study component, each RAPA-501 dose cohort can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b component. In the phase 2b component, for each RAPA-501 dose level determined to be safe, patients will be randomized to receive RAPA-501 cells (n=19) or placebo (n=19). After infusion of either RAPA-501 cells or placebo, these randomized cohorts will continue on standard-of-care therapy (not protocol-driven). The primary endpoint of the phase 2b study is 30-day mortality, with the statistical goal of reducing mortality in RAPA-501 recipients relative to the randomized, placebo-control cohort.\n\nStudy participants must be hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, specifically: SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by RT-PCR or equivalent test; pulmonary infiltrate on radiologic examination; and a diagnosis of ARDS requiring intensive respiratory support including non-invasive ventilation such as high-flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation. The study consists of: (1) a study enrollment step (screening); and (2) after eligibility is confirmed, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be performed. On Cohort 1, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be at a dose of 40 x 10^6 cells/infusion; three participants will be initially treated, with one week separating participants in this phase 1 component to evaluate for DLT, which will be defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity attributable to RAPA-501 cells within 7-days of infusion. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe (either 0/3 or 1/6 having a DLT), then Cohort 1 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe, treatment on Cohort 2 can be initiated, which will evaluate the infusion of RAPA-501 cells at a dose of 160 x 10^6 cells/infusion. In the same manner as Cohort 1, if Cohort 2 therapy is deemed to be safe, Cohort 2 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. The study will be comprised of three main stages: (1) the above-detailed 30-day interval relating to the primary study objectives; (2) an extended, total 90-day interval to continue relatively intensive clinical monitoring of potential efficacy and safety endpoints; and (3) an extended, total 6-month interval to provide long-term clinical follow-up and to continue to monitor for laboratory parameters relating to immune and viral endpoints."

Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

                              "Femoral shaft fracture is a common orthopaedic injury. Intramedullary nail is one of the standard treatments. Its primary goal is to develop an osseous bridge between adjacent motion segments to prevent motion, relieve pain, and facilitate bone union. Delayed union or nonunion is common in femoral shaft fracture. Risk factors include comminuted fracture, open fracture, smoking, diabetes and open reduction of fracture fixation. Mesenchymal stem cells are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells, some studies have shown that autologous bone marrow concentration can improve bone healing. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of bone marrow concentration on union of femoral shaft fracture."

                              "Spinal arthrodesis has become the mainstay of treatment for severe spinal deformity, spinal instability, spondylolisthesis, and symptomatic degenerative disease. Its primary goal is to develop an osseous bridge between adjacent motion segments to prevent motion, relieve pain, and facilitate neurological recovery. One of the arthrodesis method is transforaminal lumbar intebody fusion. After removal of the problematic disc, iliac crest bone graft was harvested and impacted into the space with cage to facilitate fusion. However, patients are exposed to additional risk of harvesting site, such as pain, infection, wound healing problem or hematomas. Local bone graft harvested from decompression is one of the alternative solutions to avoid these complications. However, the effect of local boen graft is inferior to iliac crest bone graft because iliac crest bone graft contains three important ingredients for successful fusion: osteoconductive scaffold, osteoinductive factors, and the ability to osteogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells, some studies have shown that autologous bone marrow concentration can improve bone healing. In this study, we will add bone marrow concentration into local bone graft during transforaminal lumbar intebody fusion and evaluate the effect of bone marrow concentration on bone healing and spinal fusion."

Although nonsurgical treatment relieves pain and improves function in the shoulder, surgical repair for a torn rotator cuff is indicated if symptoms persisted or deteriorated after 3 months nonsurgical treatments, Recently, arthroscopic repair has become the mainstream of surgical repair for rotator cuff tear. However, the healing of a repaired tendon is not always predictable.

LPB is a condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age, and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP will increase substantially over coming years.\n\nCurrent LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment. Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.\n\nIn a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby causing biomechanical functional failure.\n\nToday, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this common and debilitating disease.\n\nThe objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years."

                              "Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of disability in the world, affecting all occupational sectors with different incidence rates. It is estimated that 60 percent of all workers suffer from LBP during their careers, 10 percent of which become chronic (The Lancet. September 2017). Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of cases. A key characteristic of IDD is loss of matrix integrity and biomechanical functional failure. Today, no therapy can restore intervertebral disc (IVD) function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. Current therapies are aimed at pain reduction. When these treatments fail, several types of surgery are performed but they are often related to side effects, disturbance of motion and other biomechanical consequences. New strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Encouraging results from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that cell-based regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for LBP. LBP patients treated with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BM-MSC) showed rapid and progressive improvement of functional indexes of 65 percent to 78 percent over 1 year after intradiscal administration without side effect. ACTIVE is an ambitious randomized clinical trial aimed at developing a treatment for IDD based on intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC to improve the quality of life of workers and the disability of patients with LBP. ACTIVE main aim is to generate efficacy and safety profiles of single injections of 15 million cells/mL of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 4 discs) versus sham procedure. The regenerative potential of BM-MSC treatment will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technologies on quarterly basis up to 12 months."

                              "Context: Periodontitis are inflammatory diseases affecting the periodontium and characterized by the destruction of the tooth-supporting bone due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCLs). Two forms are described: chronic periodontitis (CP) and aggressive periodontitis (AP) that differ by the severity and rapidity of bone loss, much more important for AP than CP. In both forms, the link with uncontrolled activation of the immune system is largely admitted. But despite the physiopathology of CP is fairly well studied, very few data are available regarding AP. Based on the investigators previous studies, their hypothesis to explain this severity is the existence of a vicious circle involving immune cells, mesenchymal cells and OCLs, that would maintain and amplify inflammation and bone loss.\n\nStudy: this is a transversal, interventional and single-center study. It includes 3 groups of 20 patients: affected with AP, CP or controls (necessitating an extraction of wisdom teeth).\n\nAims: the investigators will compare the proportion of immune and mesenchymal cells in the 3 groups of patients to identify the populations potentially involved in bone destruction. The investigators will compare in vitro their capacity to induce OCL differentiation in order to determine their role in bone loss. The investigators will also compare the capacity of OCLs and mesenchymal cells to activate T cells, in order to determine their role in inflammation.\n\nMethodology: patients will be recruited in the department of periodontology, CHU of Nice. After signing the informed consent, a biopsy of periodontal granulation tissue (surgical waste) will be collected during the usual treatment of these diseases, as well as a blood sample. Then, patients will leave the study. Cells from the biopsies will be analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the proportion of lymphocytic, monocytic and mesenchymal cells. In vitro, their capacity to induce OCL differentiation or to activate T cells will be determined. From the blood samples, OCLs will be generated to study their capacity to activate T cells.\n\nChronology of consultations and examinations: 3 visits are planned: (1) a routine visit corresponding to the usual treatment of the patient during which it is proposed to participate in the study, (2) a visit to obtaining consent, clinical examination, criteria verification and (3) a visit corresponding to the usual treatment in which will be collected tissue biopsies and blood."

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is notoriously difficult to cure with 37% of patients experiencing refractory disease. As a result, patients cycle through numerous immunosuppressive medications that can have significant side effects, and >90% undergo multiple surgical interventions putting them at risk of incontinence.\n\nThe specific rationale for MSCs in perianal Crohn's fistulas is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; 2) several studies reporting the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of perianal Crohn's fistula; 3) existence of safe manufacturing methods for isolation and expansion of MSCs.\n\nThis study will enroll 20 participants that have Crohn's disease with medically and surgically refractory perianal fistulizing disease. Participants enrolled will be those that meet particular criteria for participation in the clinical trial.\n\nEnrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved, participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and again three months after this as above, and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months."

                              "This is a pilot study evaluating the addition of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) infusions to corticosteroids for the early treatment of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is a major complication following allogeneic stem cell transplant. GVHD occurs when T-lymphocytes in the donor graft respond to signals from recipient cells and cause tissue damage. This process can lead to organ injury, increased risk of infection, and graft failure. Corticosteroids have been used as the primary therapy for acute GVHD for decades, and guidelines currently recommend their use as front line treatment. Recent prospective data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network shows that GVHD will be cured in about half of patients with steroids alone. Patients who do not respond to steroids are considered steroid-resistant, and this is associated with much worse survival. It is possible to predict which patients will go on to have steroid-resistant GVHD by measuring the plasma concentration of the molecule called suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2). BMSC infusions have been used to treat steroid-resistant acute GVHD successfully, but despite a track record of safety, little is known about the use of BMSC in the early treatment setting. The main objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of administering BMSC within 5 days of diagnosis of acute GVHD. Our study will for the first time use the ST2 biomarker to more accurately assign acute GVHD to steroid refractory or sensitive, and explore changes in ST2 and other biological markers of BMSC function and their correlation with clinical response. In the process of this study, we will assess the safety and feasibility of early treatment according to our regimen, obtain estimates of efficacy at important GVHD therapy time points, and determine if treatment with BMSC can prevent the progression of GVHD in patients with high risk of GVHD progression as measured by biomarkers.\n\nThe Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center NIH has developed a BMSC repository at NIH. The NIH BMSC are a third party, early passage product based on the EU manufacturing approach. The NIH BMSC cellular product was administered safely to transplant recipients with steroid-resistant acute GVHD in a phase I study (protocol 12-H-0010, IND #14596) conducted from March 2012 to October 2012 at NIH. This pilot study is a continuation of the previous study and open to allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients at NIH (age greater than or equal to 4 yrs) with de novo acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy either directly after allogeneic transplantation or following treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion. Subjects will receive BMSC infusions (target dose of 2 times 10(6) BMSC/kg for up to 12 doses) in addition to standard upfront therapy with corticosteroids. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients without a treatment-related severe adverse event (TRSAE) at day +56. Responses will be assessed at day +28 and +56 from the initial diagnosis. Responses will be correlated to changes in GVHD biomarkers including ST2, Reg3a, TNFR1, and IL-6. Subjects will be enrolled at first diagnosis of acute GVHD, and the first BMSC infusion will be given within 120 hours of the first dose of corticosteroids. BMSC infusions will be given twice weekly for the first 4 weeks. Subjects with a complete response at the end of week 4 will not receive further infusions. All other subjects will receive BMSC infusions weekly for four additional weeks. Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Research samples will be drawn at regular intervals to explore biological correlates of response and to investigate the mechanism of action of BMSC."

Acute GVHD is defined using the NIH consensus definition inclusive of classic acute (less than or equal to 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features) AND persistent/recurrent/late onset acute (> 100 days after transplant or DLI, presence of acute GVHD features, absence of chronic GVHD features). Subjects with stage I and II skin only (overall Grade I) or isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement are eligible if the treating physician deems that systemic corticosteroid treatment is indicated. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is desirable, but not required for study entry because enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results. Patients must be diagnosed with a first episode of acute GVHD requiring systemic corticosteroids and associated with preceding administration of a cellular therapy including stem cells and donor lymphocyte infusion. Patients who were treated for GVHD associated with another cellular therapy product (e.g. prior allogeneic transplant or DLI) will be allowed into the study.\n\nPrevious immunosuppressive therapy\n\nThe patient must have received no systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of new acute GVHD (e.g. pentostatin, etanercept, denileukin difitox, etc.), except for a maximum 120 hours prior corticosteroid therapy. This does not include immune suppressive therapy for GVHD prophylaxis (e.g. calcineurin inhibitor, sirolimus, MMF, etc.). It is expected that most patients will be receiving GVHD prophylaxis as part of their transplant regimen, thus patients developing acute GVHD while on GVHD prophylaxis will still be considered eligible. Concurrent or addition of locally-acting steroid therapy (skin creams, oral budesonide, or any other locally-acting steroid preparation) is allowed.\nThere is one exception to the above stipulations: Use of the oral medication MMF (in addition to systemic corticosteroids) for the treatment of acute GVHD will be allowed. MMF is commonly given early in the treatment of acute GVHD, but it has not been shown to improve outcomes compared to steroids alone in a randomized, prospective study; therefore, treatment with MMF will not exclude patients from BMSC treatment.\nAge: Age greater than or equal to 4 years old will be allowed.\nBirth control: Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are being treated on this study.\nInformed consent: Signed informed consent and/or assent is required. Assent and educational materials will be provided to, and reviewed with, patients under the age of 18. The informed consent process will begin at recognition of patient eligibility.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nBreast feeding or pregnant females (due to unknown risk to fetus or newborn).\nKnown allergy to gentamicin."

                              "MDS typically occurs in elderly people and a portion of these subjects evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The natural history of MDS is highly heterogeneous, and therefore a risk-adapted treatment strategy is mandatory.\n\nThe presence of mutations in a given individual has only limited predictive power, as conversion to MDS is rare regardless of mutation status. In addition, in patients with overt MDS, genetic abnormalities explain only a proportion of the total hazard for survival, meaning that a large percentage is still associated with clinical and non-mutational factors. Comprehensive analyses of large patient populations are warranted to correctly estimate the independent effect of each mutation on clinical outcome and response to treatment.\n\nMoreover, environmental factors influencing the development of MDS and the probability of response to specific treatments are to be characterized. They include alterations in the immune system. In this context, a significant association was found between autoimmune disorders and MDS, and activation of the inflammasome may contribute to MDS development\n\nAIMS 1- Investigate gene mutations, niche factors and immune dysfunctions influencing the development of MDS, and define biomarkers for early identification of individuals at risk; 2- Develop prognostic models for MDS patients through integration of comprehensive genomic/clinical information; 3- Define biomarkers to better stratify the individual probability of response to specific treatments\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\n\nAIM1\n\n1a) The investigators will analyze the genomic features of clonal dominance and ineffective hematopoiesis in elderly subjects enrolled in different population-based studies.\n\nPeripheral blood samples will be available for biological investigations. A low-cost, high-throughput platform for mutation screening of 72 genes known to be relevant in MDS will be used.\n\n1b) In order to gain further insight into the MDS genetic heterogeneity, the investigators will perform DNA sequencing in hematopoietic progenitors single cells to clarify the clonal architecture of marrow dysplasia in HSC, the dynamics of clonal establishment and expansion during hematopoietic differentiation, and their relationship with the disease phenotype and evolution\n\n1c) In selected elderly individuals, the investigators will study the transcriptome (RNA sequencing) of isolated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and marrow microenvironment (i.e., innate ad adaptive immunity) with the aim to identify niche factors that may influence the development of a MDS phenotype in elderly subjects with clonal hematopoiesis. Moreover, in patients suffering from both MDS and autoimmune disorder, the investigators will analyze immunological parameters. They will be compared with those of patients with MDS but without immune disorder, and patients with immune disorders without MDS\n\nAIM2\n\nIn myeloid malignancies, it was shown that large knowledge banks of matched genomic-clinical data can improve clinical decision-making.\n\nIn the present project, basing on large MDS populations with comprehensive genomic and clinical data available within EuroBloodNet network (data on >3000 patients will be available), the investigators will develop inclusive, multistage statistical models (Bayesian network analysis and clustering) to accurately predict clinical outcomes in MDS at individual-patient level. The investigators plan to define 2 homogenous clinical cohorts in order to define distinct patterns and genetic groups within MDS and to independently validate their predictive value. As a research tool, the investigators plan to create a prototype portal within our EuroBloodNet website that allows outcome predictions to be generated based on this data set for user-defined constellations of genomic features and clinical variables. The reliability of this tool on clinical decision making will be tested in a prospective observational trial in the context of EuroBloodNet\n\nAIM3\n\nThe investigators will analyze the mutational status and immune landscape associated with response to HMA in MDS patients enrolled in prospective clinical trials conducted within the EuroBloodNet network. Patients treated with azacitidine from prospective studies will be available for biological investigations to define biomarkers associated with clinical response. Validation of biomarkers will then be performed in an independent cohort. In all these studies, biobanking of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples has been systematically performed, providing a unique resource to be investigated within this proposal. Data on mutational screening and immune profiles are already available in most patients, and were obtained by comparable methods. For mutation screening, a NGS approach covering key genes involved in myeloid malignancies and the response to HMA was used. For a comprehensive immunological characterization of T lymphocytes, NK cells and ILC cells, standardized flow cytometric protocols were used, which will provide novel insights into frequency, differentiation and activity of these cells in response to therapy. Complementary immunoassays based on Luminex technology will be used to quantify secretory proteins (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors) in BM and PB plasma samples."

                              "Complex perianal fistulas represent one of the most challenging manifestations of Crohn's disease. Combined surgical and medical therapy with biologic drugs today represents the first-line treatment option but the overall success rate does not exceed 60%. The treatment of patients in which complete closure cannot be achieved despite the combination of biological therapy and surgery, is still not well defined. These patients may benefit from innovative therapeutic approaches such as mesenchymal stromal cells. The adipose tissue is an ideal source, due to its abundance and easy access. The investigators evaluate safety, feasibility and effectiveness of local injections of micro-fragmented adipose tissue in patients with refractory complex fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a no profit interventional prospective study without drugs. A cohort of patients (15) with complex perianal Crohn's Disease, refractory to standard treatment with biologic drugs, or with secondary failure after initial effectiveness or presenting clinical contraindications to biological treatment are enrolled in the study.\n\nAfter the enrolment, medical history and clinical data are collected and pre-operatory exams, pelvic MRI, and laboratory tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) are performed. Health-related quality of life is assessed by a disease-specific (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire) and a generic (Short-Form 36 Health Survey) questionnaire.\n\nMETHODS\n\n- Harvesting of the adipose tissue\n\nThe lower/lateral abdomen or, eventually, the inner/outer thigh are chosen as donor site for adipose tissue harvesting under general or spinal anaesthesia. Before the harvesting, the donor site is injected with 100 cc of Klein Solution (500 cc saline, 1 cc epinephrine 1/1000 IU, and 40 cc lidocaine 2%) using a disposable 17 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 60-cc luer-lock syringe. The fat is then harvested (50-100 cc) using a 13 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 20-ml VacLok\u00ae syringe.\n\n- Processing of the adipose tissue with the Lipogems\u00ae device\n\nThe harvested fat is immediately processed in the Lipogems\u00ae processing kit (Lipogems International Spa, Milan, Italy). Lipogems\u00ae is a disposable device that mechanically reduces the size of the adipose tissue clusters while eliminating oily substances and blood residues with pro-inflammatory properties. The entire process is carried out in one surgical step in complete immersion in physiological solution minimizing any traumatic action on the cells and microarchitecture. The processed micro-fragmented fat is collected in a 60-cc syringe and positioned to decant the excess of saline solution. At the end, the product is transferred in several 5-cc syringes to be re-injected in the patient.\n\n- Surgical procedure and micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems\u00ae) injection\n\nExamination under anaesthesia is performed in order to identify all the fistula tracts and abscesses; eventual purulent material is drained and the fistula tracts curetted. Necrotic and inflamed tissues are excised using a \"cone-like\" fistulectomy at each fistula tract. After local surgical drainage of the perianal disease, 20 cc of micro-fragmented adipose tissue are injected circumferentially into the submucosa surrounding the internal fistula orifice and in the perianal tissue along the residual fistula tract.\n\n- Follow-up visits and outcome measures\n\nAll patients are assessed at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks after the procedure. During all follow-up visits, laboratory tests and clinical examination are performed. health related quality of life questionnaires are also administered. A second pelvic MRI is performed at 24 weeks to radiologically assess the results."

Recently, a phase II multicenter randomized study was reported showing that expanded adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (atMSCs) in combination with fibrin glue was an effective and safe treatment for complex perianal fistula. However, dose escalation of allogeneic bone marrow (bm) MSCs for the local treatment of perianal fistulas has not been studied.\n\nIn this study, three escalating doses will be tested in a total of three cohorts. MSC implantation will be preceded by surgical localization, curettage of the fistulous tract and closure of the internal opening. Per cohort, patients will be randomized in a 5:2 fashion to receive either 10x10^6 (cohort 1), 30x10^6 (cohort 2) or 90x10^6 (cohort 3) bmMSCs or no cells (control group).\n\nThe primary endpoint will be assessed at week 12: i) the number of adverse and serious adverse events and ii) a reduction in the number of draining fistulas, which is defined as absence of discharge and absence of collections of \u22652 cm directly related to the treated fistulas tracts as measured by MRI."

Twelve (12) persons with SCI who have chronic shoulder pain for longer than 6 months in spite of completing conservative treatment who are diagnosed with rotator cuff disease on examination. Micro-fragmented adipose tissue will be obtained by using a minimal manipulation technique in a closed system (Lipogems\u00ae), without the addition of enzymes or any additives. The final product will consist of micronized fat tissue yielding fat clusters with preserved vascular stroma of about 500 microns with intact stromal vascular niches and harboring regenerative cellular elements. Approximately 6 mL of micro-fragmented adipose will be injected into the tendon with a 22-gauge needle under continuous ultrasound guidance. No other biological or pharmacological agents will be used in combination with the micro-fragmented adipose. After 24 hours, subjects will be given a standardized stretching protocol to follow for 4 weeks followed by a formal strengthening program. Participants will be followed for adverse events and changes in shoulder pain intensity on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10, with anchors \"no pain\" and \"pain as bad as you can imagine\"); the Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI; 15-item disease-specific functional measure of shoulder pain in persons with SCI); the Brief Pain Inventory interference items (BPI-I7; a subscale of 7 items measuring interference with general activity, sleep, mood, relationships, etc.); and a 5-point subject global impression of change (SGIC) scale. Subjects will be examined at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months after the treatment. Follow-up shoulder ultrasound will be performed at 6 months."

                              "Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease. It is characterized by a progressive destruction of all the components of the joint, especially the cartilage. This leads to pain, loss of mobility and can be a major disability for some patients.\n\nKnee osteoarthritis affects 30% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 and is one of the most disabling conditions. In the final stage, the only therapeutic option to relieve patients is to replace the joint with a total knee prosthesis.\n\nPrevious research has shown that self-administered questionnaires to assess the benefits of management in knee osteoarthritis were limited and didn't accurately describe recovery from total knee replacement.\n\nFunctional performance tests can objectively capture a patient's mobility, but each test only approaches a small number of parameters involved in movement, which is not representative of the subject's experiences in daily life (walking, going up/down stairs, getting up from a chair).\n\nIn knee OA the assessment of pain and function is often based on validated parameters (visual analog scales and/or self-questionnaires) but variable over time (during the day, depending on physical activity or between 2 medical visits).\n\nGiven these challenges, there is great interest in using low-cost wearable sensors to develop mobile tools to obtain functional data on patients.\n\nThanks to the contribution of an evaluation technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS device), the objective is to better evaluate and understand the movement deficit of of knee OA subjects.\n\nThe investigators believe that the combination of clinical, biological, imaging and mobility parameters will allow us to identify prognostic factors for OA.\n\nThe hypothesis is that, thanks to the contribution of a technique based on inertial sensors (X-SENS), the investigators can better evaluate the movement deficit of knee OA subjects. The goal is to propose specific, rapid telekinetic biomarkers, allowing a better evaluation of functional improvements following therapeutic interventions, such as a total knee replacement.\n\nAnother hypothesis is to better understand the alterations in mobility of the knee OA subject by studying several parameters: contractile function of the quadriceps; changes in body composition and muscle volume; and biological functions of muscle fibers and joint tissue."

This study is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the Department of Neurology & Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem in Israel. In addition, ALS patients could also be referred to the clinical site above by other medical centers.\n\nAll patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrollment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 2 years. ALS patients identified as \"predisposed\" will be approached and requested to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Overall, 14 patients will be recruited.\n\nTreatment will start with the lowest dose (94x106 cells) and the dose will be increased to the next medium and high dose (141x106 and 188x106 respectively), for the next patients group only following safety analysis.\n\nThe expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is in-between two weeks up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day during visit 2 (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every month during a \"run in period\" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the disease (allowing a time window of \u00b1 5 days for all visits). During the \"run in period\" after about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow aspirate based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last \"run in period\" visit, patients will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM+IT to the early ALS patients.\n\nAfter the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post treatment follow up period of 6 months (allowing a time window of \u00b1 5 days for all visits). Treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, to establish ALS progression rate assessment of the disease will be recorded throughout the duration of the \"run in period\" and the post treatment follow up period."

MSCs are capable to direct differentiation into chondrocytes, produce cytokines and growth factors with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, stimulate angiogenesis, as well as induce chemotaxis of endogenous progenitors. Bone marrow-derived and placenta-derived MMSCs can be considered the most promising source for cell therapy of joints disorders according to availability, safety and expected therapeutic efficacy."

                              "Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty. Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July 2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies"

Briefly, the procedures are:\n\n100 ml of adipose tissue will be wash in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco Invitrogen). A one-step digestion by 1 mg/ml collagenase type I (Invitrogen) will be performe for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C during permanent shaking, follow by filtration step through a 100 \u00b5m mesh filter (BD FALCON, BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA, USA). The cell suspension will be centrifuge at 800 g for 10 minutes, and erythrocytes were removed by lysis buffer, pH 7.3.\nThe remaining cells will be wash at 400 g for 10 minutes and then culture at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/cm2 in T75 culture flasks and DMEM-F12 (Gibco Invitrogen) supplemente with 10% of fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml). The culture medium will be replace three days after seeding, and then twice a week.\nASCs will be subculture after reaching 80% confluence, with 0.5% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) solution. Cells will be replate at a density of 4x103 cells/cm2 for expansion11A.\nQuality control of cell suspension sterility will be evaluate by tests to detect bacteria and fungi (Bact / Alert 3D, Biomerieux), endotoxins (Endosafe \u2122 PTS, Charles River) and Mycoplasma (KIT MycoAlert \u2122 PLUS Mycoplasma Detection, Lonza). Cell viability will be performe by flow cytometry using the vital dye 7-AAD (7-Aminoactinomycin D - BD#559925) to determine the percentage of viable cells and Annexin V protein (BD#51-65875X) to determine the percentage of cells in apoptosis. Cytogenetic analysis wil be performe by GTG-banding method.\nCells will be phenotypically characterize by flow cytometry before the clinical application, using the following monoclonal antibodies: FITC-labeled CD14 (BD#555397), CD45 (BD#555482), CD19 (BD#555412), CD44 (BD#555478); PE-labeled CD73 (BD#550257), CD90 (BD#555596), CD166 (BD#559263), PerCP-labeled HLA-DR (BD#551375); APC-labeled CD34 (BD#555824), CD105 (BD#562408), CD29 (BD#559883) all purchased from BD (Pharmingen). At least 100.000 events wil bel acquire on a BD FACSCalibur\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data wil be analyzed using FlowJo 10 (TreeStar) software11A.\n\nAfter the ASCs extraction, isolate, culture and process, the infusion in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes wil be according as describe bellow:\n\nAt the day of infusion, ASCs monolayer wil be dissociate as described above and 1x106 cells/kg of the recipient patient wil be ressuspend in 5 ml of saline solution with 50% albumin and 5% anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution. Cell suspension wil send to the hospital in a cooler with recycled ice.\nPatients that wil receive ASCs wil be admitte to the hospital in the day of the infusion and wil discharge 24 hours after infusion. A single dose of ASCs wil be infuse in a peripheral upper arm vein during 15-20 minutes. Patients wil start takking oral cholecalciferol 2000 UI one day after the ASCs infusion.\n\nSafety Tests: adverse events wil be record during the hospitalization (T0) and at each follow-up outpatient visit (3 [T3], 6 [T6], 12 [T12], 18 [T18], and 24 [T24] months after the ASCs infusion), with clinical and laboratory exams (blood count, lipids, renal and hepatic function, thyroid stimulating hormone, free tyroxine, antithyroglobulin antibody, calcium, phosphorus and 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D, performed with automated biochemical equipment CMD 800 IX1).\n\nClinical and Pancreatic Function Evaluation: Participants wil be followed for 24 months. On the first visit, all patients wil be interviewed and had a physical exam. Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart frequency, frequency of hypoglycemia and insulin dose/kg of body weight wil be evaluate in the first visit (T0) and after 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 6 (T6) 12 (T12) ,18 (18), and 24 (24) months.\n\nInsulin dose adjustments wil be performe at each visit as necessary. All patients wil receive nutritional guidance according to American Diabetes Association recommendations.\n\nBlood samples wil be drawn prio to ASCs infusion and at T1, T3, T6, T12, T18 and T24 for the measurement the Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c. Method: High Performance Liquid Chromatography by boronate affinity). \u03b2-cell function wil be evaluated through C-Peptide measurement (Microparticle Chemiluminescent Immunoassay method, Architect Abbott) after a liquid mixed meal (Glucerna\u00ae), considering the time 0 (basal), 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The area under the curve wil be calculate.\n\nComparison with previous case-control study using only vitamin D supplementation as intervention:\n\nThe investigators wil compare our results with patients previously included in a case-control study that investigated the effects of daily 2000 UI vitamin D without the infusion of cells in individuals with recent onset type 1 diabetes and similar age (> 15 years old), from a different population (S\u00e3o Paulo) in the same country region (Brazilian Southeast). Therefore, the investigators wil establish three different groups for comparison: 1) patients that wil receive ASCs + Vitamin D supplementation; 2) patients that wil receive only vitamin D supplementation; 3) patients that wil receive the conventional treatment for diabetes but any additional experimental treament (ASCs or Vitamin D).\n\nInsulin dose adjustments or withdrawal wil be performed according to glycemic control. Changes in HbA1c, C-Peptide and insulin dose/kg of body weight wil be compare between groups. C-Peptide wil be analyze by immunofluorometric assay (AutoDelfia) at T0 and T6 and T12 and T18 and T24, considering basal and peak stimulated C-Peptide after mixed meal test (Glucerna)."

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

                              "Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.\n\nThe most popular form of autologous MSC therapy has been through the use of autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate (MSCs, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a \"healing\" effect on the environment in which it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\n\nAdipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of MSCs versus that in bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known as stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.\n\nAlthough the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and \"dose\" have not been performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized study arms with different types of MSCs (bone marrow derived MSC, adipose derived MSC, and umbilical cord tissue MSC) and then will be further randomized to receive an injection of the MSC type they were initially assigned to or corticosteroid. Participants randomized to bone marrow derived MSC or adipose derived MSC will undergo a procedure (bone marrow aspiration or liposuction). Participants will be blinded to whether they receive the MSC or corticosteroid injection."

Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group. Kidneys from the same donor of DCD will be random allocated to intervention group and control group. In intervention group the investigators will collect SVF from recipients with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of DCD kidney transplantation during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. The investigators will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in DCD kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of autologous SVF derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival, improving allograft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, the investigators will assess the percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis within one week), and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities."

At its first phase, 15 consenting patients with MS are included.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nConsenting patients fulfilled the following 4 inclusion criteria for this study:\n\nthe clinical criteria of Poser et alfor definite MS;\nmen and nonpregnant women aged 25 to 65 years;\nduration of disease longer than 5 years; and\nfailure to respond to the currently available and registered agents for MS (ie, interferons, glatiramer acetate [Copaxone], and immuno-suppressors), as manifested by an increase of at least 1 degree in the EDSS score during the past year or the appearance of at least 2 major MS relapses during the same period.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\npatients who were treated with cytotoxic medications (ie, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and azathioprine) during the 3 months before the trial;\npatients with significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure or any other disease that may interfere with the ability to interpret the results of the study;\npatients with an active infection; and\npatients who showed severe cognitive decline or were unable to understand and sign the informed consent.\n\nBone marrow aspiration is performed under short general anesthesia with puncture from the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or a right lateral position. Approximately 200 mL of bone marrow inocula are obtained from each patient.\n\nMSC Preparation and Culture A culture of purified MSCs is prepared under aseptic conditions (positively pressurized clean rooms) using filtered sterilized Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with low glucose lev- els (Qiagen, Valencia, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- nystatin solution (all from Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit- Haemek, Israel).\n\nMesenchymal cells are cultured for 40 to 60 days, until they reach confluency, and then harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide-containing medium in liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C). At 2 weeks, a sample is taken for sterility testing and quality control. After sterility confirmed, the MSCs are transferred to the laboratory on dry ice, thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and washed twice with normal saline solution to remove any residual dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells are then resuspended in normal saline at a concentration of 10x106/mL to 15x106/mL. Two-thirds of the total number of cells (usually 60x106 to 100x106) are injected intrathecally, and one-third, intravenously. A sample of the cells to be injected is tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis; cells (98%) should express the surface markers characteristic of MSCs (CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and be negative for CD34, CD45, and CD14.\n\nTreatment Protocol All patients receive an intrathecal injection via a standard lumbar puncture (mean of 1 million cells per Kg of body weight) and an intravenous injection of 0.3-1 million cells per kg, intravenously..\n\nAn extension phase is scheduled for patients completing the first phase of this trial as an open prospective study with repeated intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous MSC in patients from the initial trial and 10 additional ones (total up to 24 patients) with progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive or relapsing-progressive). Patients should be defined as failures to first and second lines of immunomodulatory treatments experiencing deterioration (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS scale) during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major relapse without sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of body weight, intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or IV-injections of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the trial is 4 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).\n\nImmunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month 6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS) analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune activation or of regulatory cell phenotype."

However, CNI toxicity leads to significant morbidity. Moreover, CNIs cannot prevent long-term allograft injury.\n\nMesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) have potent immunomodulatory properties, which may promote allograft tolerance and ameliorate toxicity of high-dose CNI. The MYSTEP1 trial aims to investigate safety and feasibility of donor-derived MSCs in pLT.\n\nMethods/Design: 7 to 10 children undergoing living-donor pLT will be included in this open-label, prospective pilot trial. A dose of 1 \u00d7 106 MSCs/kg body weight will be given at two time points: first by intraportal infusion intraoperatively and second by intravenous infusion on postoperative day 2. In addition, participants will receive standard immunosuppressive treatment. Our primary objective is to assess the safety of intraportal and intravenous MSC infusion in pLT recipients. Our secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of MSC treatment as measured by the individual need for immunosuppression and the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection. We will perform detailed immune monitoring to investigate immunomodulatory effects.\n\nDiscussion: Our study will provide information on the safety of donor-derived MSCs in pediatric living-donor liver transplantation and their effect on immunomodulation and graft survival."

                              "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs). In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells. These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\nPure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\nAdipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles, Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control and release criteria.\n\nBeside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\nMSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to mesenchymal tissue."

Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of BSMMU for this clinical trial (Reference No: BSMMU/2018/25, dated 01/01/2018). Impacts of a single intra-articular (IA) injection of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) containing mesenchymal stem cells on pain, physical function, stiffness, and cartilage thickness assessed and compared before and after intervention. Patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis (OA) knee included in the study. Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiological scores were used to define OA grade; however, high-frequency musculoskeletal ultrasonogram (MSUS) was used to measure cartilage thickness. There is no standard protocol to follow while assessing cartilage thickness; however, recent work of Podlipska and co-workers would be a worth consideration for using adipose tissue for cartilage regeneration. As medial tibio-femoral joint is the most commonly involved in KOA, here, we consider medial femoral cartilage thickness. The assessment used a commercially available ultrasound device (Samsung Accuvix, 2010, origin- South Korea) with a 15 megahertz linear transducer ML6-15. The patient was positioned supine with the knee in full flexion. A proximal-distal probe sweeping over the anterior-central knee area, medial femoral articular cartilage imaged in an axial plane. Degenerated cartilage signified either loss of surface sharpness or increased inner echogenicity; local or total thinning of articular cartilage. The definitions for articular cartilage degeneration are as follows: Grade 0 - a monotonous anechoic band with sharp hyperechoic anterior and posterior interfaces, Grade 1 - loss of the average sharpness of cartilage interfaces and or increased echogenicity of the cartilage, Grade 2a - grade 1 plus thinning of articular cartilage less than 50%, Grade 2b - more than 50% but less than 100% thinning of articular cartilage, Grade 3 -100% local loss of the cartilage tissue.\n\nA total of thirty KOA was randomly divided into two groups - case and control. Both groups received conventional care for KOA (acetaminophen 1 gram thrice daily for 14 days, quadriceps strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, mind-body, proprioception, mechanical diagnosis, and therapy (MDT) exercises, and activities of daily living (ADL) modifications4, 18-20. Fifteen received six milliliters (ml) single-dose of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells (TOST) and 3 ml activated PRP). PRP was activated with 0.1 ml calcium gluconate per 0.9 ml of PRP (1:9 ratio). However, no orthobiological product was given in another fifteen participants."

The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the injections. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as secondary endpoints.\n\nApplications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a \"run-in\" period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.\n\nOne month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post last MSC-injection.\n\nTo establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-\"run in period\" and for the whole duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared to the progression rate during the \"run-in\" period.\n\nThe follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters: WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.\n\nAll selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen. One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using our previously described protocol with slight modification.\n\nOne month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula."

                              "Patients selection:\n\nIn this clinical trial, investigators considered therapeutic effect of MSCs in SM-exposed male patients.Patients, had a documented encounter with SM during the Iran-Iraq war. The patients signed informed consent before study. They were selected according to the following criteria: (a) the severity of lung injury was ranged from moderate 50< forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <65 to severe 40<FEV1<50; (b) absence of contraindications spirometry (hemoptysis, cerebral arterial aneurysm or aortic, pulmonary embolism, uncontrolled blood pressure, recent pneumothorax, no doubt surgery/thoracic recent, recent stroke); and (c) no coagulation. The exclusion criteria for the selection process were as follow: (a) participate in another study at the same time; (b) smoking habitat; (c) the existence of pneumonia during the study; (d) the incidence of transfusion reaction; (e) underlying other diseases (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes).\n\nIsolation and culture of adipose derived stem cells:\n\n200mL of abdominal adipose tissue was obtained under local anesthesia by liposuction aspirates protocol. The lipoaspirate was washed with PBS to remove tissue debris. 100mL PBS containing 0.1% w/v collagenase A type I was added to isolated tissue and then incubated at 37\u00baC for 60 minutes. Collagenase activity was neutralized using MEM medium along with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium after centrifugation at 2000rpm for 10 min, and then transferred to culture flasks for 72 h at 37\u00baC in 5% CO2 condition. The culture medium in the flasks was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged for two times.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis:\n\nTo analyze the cell surface antigen expression, 5\u00d7105 fresh cells from third passage were harvested by trypsin-EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 1 min, resuspended in stain buffer (PBS, 2% FBS) and then incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Trypsin was neutralized by centrifuge and isolated cells were washed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in stain buffer. Cells were incubated in dark environment for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cells were labeled with anti-human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugated to fluorochromes. These antibodies were as follow: anti-CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD73-phycoerythrin (PE), CD11b-FITC, CD34-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD45-PE, CD105-PE. The frequencies of all immunolabeled cells were analyzed by FACS Canto II flow cytometer, in which approximately 500,000 events were assessed and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0).\n\nKaryotype analysis for abnormalities detection:\n\nStandard Giemsa staining procedure was performed and chromosome preparations were obtained from 80% confluent cells. To stop microtubule formation, the cells were treated with Colcemid solution. The mitotic arrested cells were then harvested using trypsin-EDTA. The cells were extracted and then immersed in 75 mmol/l KCl for 30 minute at laboratory temperature. Finally, they obtained by a centrifugation. The supernatant was replaced with fixative solution and the suspension was spread over slides for microscopic examination and imaging. At least, 15 metaphase spreads were analyzed. The karyotypes were considered with light microscope using a cytovision software.\n\nFreezing and Storage of Adipose-derived Stem Cells:\n\nADMSCs were harvested at 90% confluence before injection for freezing. To collect cells, culture medium was removed and replaced with sterile PBS and after three minutes it was replaced with trypsin-EDTA solution and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Complete medium (MEM with 10% FBS) was added to inactivate the trypsin, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in cryopreservation medium (80% FBS, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 10% MEM medium) with a final concentration of 5 million cells per milliliter and aliquoted into cryovials. The vials stored at -80 \u00b0C overnight and then transferred into a liquid nitrogen container for long-term storage.\n\nMSCs injection and Study plan:\n\nPatients received 100\u00d7106 cells every 20 day for four injections within 2 months and screened for 7 times. MSCs were injected intravenously along with 300 ml normal saline to the patient at a maximum rate of 2\u00d7106 cells/min. Each infusion took approximately 30 minute to be completed. After each injection, patient stayed at hospital for at least 6h as recovery time. Efficacy of MSCs treatment in these patients were evaluated using the following parameters: pulmonary functions test (PFTs) [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC], total lung capacity by body plethysmography, single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (CO diffusion) , exercise performance [6-minute walk test (6MWT)], Borg scale dyspnea assessment (BSDA), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SRGQ) and comprehensive safety evaluation."

                              "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that affects the articular cartilage over time and is accompanied by alterations to the synovium, subchondral bone, ligaments, and menisci, as well as hypertrophy of the joint capsule.\n\nTherapies are typically palliative and only alleviate pain in a symptomatic way, failing to stop cartilage degeneration and the following breakdown of other joint structures Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to tackle the challenge of creating OA-modifying therapeutics. The potential of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose derived stromal cells fraction also known as stromal vascular fraction has recently being evaluated for chondroprotective efficacy in oa knees.\n\nThe present study was taken to evaluate Clinical Effectiveness without any doubt after administration of Non enzymatically processed adipose derived stromal cells along with platelet rich plasma in large number (140 patients) having moderate to severe knee (stage 3 and 4) with objective MRI assessment and 2 year follow up.\n\nMethods\n\nThe selection criteria included patients 50 years of age or older with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee that was defined by daily pain for the previous three months, analgesic use at least once per week, less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness, and a WOMAC score of 75 in the target knee. Grades 3 and 4 kellergen Radiographic Grading Scale of Osteoarthritis were part of the radiographic qualifying requirements. The exclusion criteria included individuals with clinically significant systemic diseases and patients with evidence of secondary knee osteoarthritis or severe osteoarthritis (joint space width-JSW 2 mm).\n\nThe WOMAC score, developed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities, is a commonly used indicator of patients' subjective ratings of pain, joint mobility, and physical impairment. With 5, 2, and 17 questions, respectively, it assesses three dimensions: pain, stiffness, and physical function. A minimum score is 0, highest score is 96. The maximum score for each subscale is 20, 8, or 68, correspondingly .\n\nIn order to measure the six-minute walking distance (6MWD), a 50 m distance was marked in an internal hallway, and participants were instructed to walk as far and as rapidly as they could during the course of six minutes. The whole distance was calculated and noted.\n\nUsing previously described procedures, antero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were taken with patients standing at a distance of 1 m from the X-Ray source, with the knee completely extended. The joint space width was measured at its narrowest point (minimal JSW). According to a prior publication this trend was indicated by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm over the trial.\n\nAntero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were acquired using the previously described techniques while patients stood 1 m away from the X-Ray source with their knees fully extended. At the joint space's narrowest point, the breadth was measured (minimal JSW). This tendency was shown by a JSW loss of more than 0.50 mm during the study, in accordance with a previous publication.\n\nPatients were instructed to take etoricoxib at a dose of no more than 90 mg BD after meals if their discomfort was intolerable. They were instructed to take 30 mg of codeine as needed if the discomfort persisted and to report the next day. Aside from any symptoms or indications that the patient reported, laboratory-based hematological and biochemical tests were also performed as part of the tolerance and safety evaluations.\n\nA microscopic examination of the synovial fluid was performed at baseline and two years after the surgery to check for abnormal cell counts. According to the degree to which they interfered with the subject's everyday activities, adverse occurrences were classified as isolated, intermittent, or chronic. The possible causal association between the supplement and the outcome was categorized as Definite/Possible/Probable/Non-Assessable/None. The institutional committee for stem cell research and therapy gave its approval to the project. All of the patients provided written consent to participate in the trial after receiving enough information.\n\nSVF preparation :\n\nWith the help of a 3 mm aspiration cannula and tumescent solution, about 100 ml of fat was collected from each patient's belly and put into sterile, disposable 250 ml conical centrifuge tubes. The adipose tissue underwent two PBS washes before being sonically cavitated by ultrasound at 10 mega hertz ,50 W for 30 minutes with 5-minute intervals of agitation. The SVF was then extracted as a pellet by dividing the suspension into four 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuging them at 500 g for five minutes. To get rid of any remaining enzyme, the pellet was washed twice with regular saline before being resuspended in PBS. The SVF suspension was spun at 500 g for 5 min after being filtered using a 100 m cell strainer. The extra fluid was dumped. The pellet was put back together with regular saline and passed through a 40 m cell strainer. Samples were collected in order to count the number of cells, assess their vitality, and cultivate, and define the stem cells.\n\nPRP preparation: The same donor who provided the adipose tissue's peripheral blood also provided the platelet-rich plasma. ACD Solution A was added to BD yellow top vacuum tubes with 20 ml of peripheral blood, and the tubes were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. To obtain a platelet pellet, the plasma fraction was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. After that, just 3 ml of plasma remained, which was used to resuspend the platelets."

                              "Introduction:\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disease of alarmingly increasing prevalence (8 - 16%) associated with mortality [1]. CKD can progress towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring renal replacement therapy. ESRD currently accounts for 6.3% of the Medicare spending in the United States, and is projected to increase by 85% by 2015 [2]. In a study conducted among rural population in Bangladesh overall CKD prevalence was found about 19% [3]. Furthermore, ESRD has a major impact on quality of life and life expectancy [4]. Therefore, it is very important to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent, alleviate, or decelerate progression of renal failure.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and hypertension represent major causes of CKD and initiation of dialysis [5]. In addition, glomerular diseases, malnutrition, infectious diseases, and acute kidney injury may lead to ESRD, contributing to the increased global burden of death [6]. Current treatment modalities often fail to target the major underlying contributors for progression of renal disease [7]. Management of CKD at present mostly aims at control of the predisposing factors and supplementation of kidneys homeostatic functions but not at the treatment of the diseased kidney itself. Again due to lack of adequate facilities or financial constraints people of a developing country like Bangladesh are unable to continue long term or lifelong dialysis. Chronic glomerular and tubule-interstitial fibrosis is a common pathway to ESRD, often associated with apoptosis, oxidative damage, fibrosis and microvascular rarefaction. Unfortunately, the regenerative potential of kidney is limited under chronic conditions and inefficient to prevent progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubule-interstitial fibrosis [8]. Treatment strategies that boost cellular regeneration might therefore offer good alternatives for patients with CKD.\n\nStromal vascular fraction (SVF):\n\nSVF of adipose tissue is a rich source of pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), endothelial progenitor cell, T cells, B cells, mast cells as well as adipose tissue macrophages [9,10]. SVF is a component of the lipo-aspirate obtained from liposuction of subcutaneous tissue. Lipo-aspirate contains a large population of stem cells called adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), which share a number of similarities with bone marrow stem cells, including the capacity for multilineage differentiation .\n\nStem Cells:\n\nA stem cell is a generic term referring to any unspecialized cell that is capable of long-term self-renewal through cell division but that can be induced to differentiate into a specialized, functional cell. Stem cells are generally two types, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Adult stem cells can be obtained from many differentiated tissues including bone marrow, bone, fat, and muscle etc. Obtaining adult stem cells also does not raise any ethical concerns [11]. For most studies, the adult stem cell in question is actually a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cell. They are multipotent but not pluripotent, which means they can differentiate into some, or \"multiple,\" but not all tissue types [11]. Stem cells that are harvested from the patient with the intention of administering them back to the same patient are termed autologous MSCs. MSC can also be isolated from the bone marrow (bmMSC), peripheral blood, connective tissue, skeletal muscle, dental pulp (dpMSC), umbilical cord wall (ucMSC), umbilical cord blood (cbMSC), amniotic fluid (afMSC) and all have been used in experimental settings to treat various types of renal diseases. An important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival [12].\n\nAdvantages of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs):\n\nADSCs are somatic stem cell population contained in fat tissue and have been shown to possess stem cell properties such as trans-differentiation and self-renewal [13]. Similar to other types of MSCs, ADSCs express multiple CD marker antigens (CD73+CD90+CD105+ CD34+/- CD11b- CD104b- CD19- CD31- CD45- SMA-) [14,15]. Additionally, utilizing ADSCs is advantageous in that large quantities of stem cells are easily isolated using minimally invasive surgical procedures [16].\n\nADSCs are vascular precursor cells. Many studies have shown that SVF contains progenitor cells that are able to differentiate into endothelial cells and participate in blood vessel formation [17]. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that SVF cells expressing both pericyte and mesenchymal markers reside in a peri-endothelial location and stabilize endothelial networks [17] Another study showed that ADSCs transplanted into an ischemic renal cortex preferentially migrate toward micro vessels where they differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells [18]. Some trials on kidney transplant recipients as well as the one on FSGS and 2 on CKD patients include in their protocol the utilization of adMSC. Adipose tissue is an important source of MSC, with a frequency 100 to 1000 times higher than bmMSC. They also seem to possess a higher potential for angiogenesis or vasculogenesis [19].\n\nKidney disease and mesenchymal stem cells:\n\nA number of different types of cells from the bone marrow have been tested in animals and in clinical studies for potential use in kidney disease. Amongst all the cells under investigation, MSCs have shown the most promising results to date as they help kidney cells to grow, inhibit cell death and encouraging the kidney's own stem cells to repair kidney damage [20].\n\nFew clinical trials have tested safety and efficacy of MSCs for renal disease. Reinders and colleagues studied safety and feasibility in six kidney allograft recipients who received two intravenous infusions of expanded autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs [21]. Importantly, delivery of autologous MSCs was not associated with adverse events, nor did it compromise graft survival. Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the therapeutic potential of autologous and allogeneic MSCs for treatment of renal diseases [22] Administration of both bmMSC and adMSC has demonstrated significant reno-protective effects including reduction of intrarenal inflammatory infiltrate, decreased fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis [12] MSCs possess unique immunomodulatory properties that ameliorate inflammation and immune responses, constituting a promising tool to facilitate renal repair. In recent years, experimental studies have uncovered the potential of MSCs to improve renal function in several models of CKD, and several clinical studies have indicated their safety and efficacy in CKD [22].\n\nADSCs could be incorporated into damaged tissues or organs which could give rise to new functional components and also exert potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, or immunomodulation effects through paracrine or autocrine routes (via vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, stromal-derived factor-1alpha and hepatocyte growth factor) [23,24]. Interestingly, it is proposed that even apoptotic or dying ADSCs exhibit distinctive immunosuppressive properties [25]. ADSCs have been shown to possess stronger anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating functions than bone marrow derived MSCs [26].\n\nVillanueva et al. explored the effect of ADSCs on CKD by a single intravenous infusion of ADSCs on a nephrectomy induced CKD model of rats [27]. ADSC treatment was associated with reduced plasma creatinine, higher levels of epitheliogenic and angiogenic proteins, and improved renal function. Work by Hyun et al [28] illustrated the beneficial effects of ADSCs on improving renal function on a IgAN mouse model. Zhang et al. [30] found that repeated systemic administration of ADSCs attenuated proteinuria, glomerulus hypertrophy, and tubular interstitial injury in a DN rat model [29].\n\nCurrently, several Clinical trials have been uploaded in the NIH database, all aim to test mainly the safety of using MSC and their efficacy in treating CKD. Two of them propose the use of autologous bmMSC and two adMSC. A study conducted in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, which was designed to provide confirmation of Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in CKD. There 18 months safety and efficacy of autologous MSC as a therapy for CKD total of 10 patients were conducted with I/V injection of high dose of 2x106/kg of autologous MSC. Assessments were performed at 1,3,6,12 and 18 months after cell injections [30].\n\nAnother study conducted in Birmingham, Alabama, Rochester, Minnesota, Jackson, Mississippi, USA where stem cell product called \"Mesenchymal stem cell\" grown from person's own fat tissue infused back in to the patient's own kidney and primary outcome measured after 3 months where renal tissue oxygenation increased and decrease in kidney inflammation was seen as secondary outcome [31].\n\nRoute of delivery:\n\nVarious routes for delivery of ADSCs, ADSC-induced cells, or ADSCs combined with compound materials have been developed for the treatment of different diseases or damaged tissue. These routes can be classified into two categories: systemic delivery through blood vessels (intravenous injection or intra-arterial injection) or local delivery directly into injured tissues or organs [32] The route of MSC delivery may influence the cells' capacity to home and engraft the damaged tissue, and thereby their efficacy for renal repair. Commonly used experimental methods to deliver MSCs include systemic intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal delivery. In nonhuman primates the cells distribute broadly into the kidneys, skin, lung, thymus, and liver with estimated levels of engraftment ranging from 0.1 to 2.7% [33].\n\nThe route of MSC delivery, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal, may affect their efficiency for kidney repair. When labeled MSC intravenously infused into baboons were observed for 9-21 months, estimated levels of engraftment in the kidney, lung, liver, thymus, and skin ranged from 0.1-2.7% [34] Indeed, the intravenous route lags in delivery efficiency, because MSC may initially be trapped in the lungs. Intra-arterial infusion of MSC was the most effective route to achieve immunomodulation in rat kidney transplantation, possibly by avoiding lodging in the pulmonary circulation, allowing MSC to home to the injured kidney [35].\n\nAn important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival. By secreting proangiogenic and trophic factors, injected MSCs not only can enhance proliferation, but also can decrease apoptosis of tubular cells [36]. Several routes of administration (intra-parenchymal, sub-capsular, intravenous) have been explored and all seem to be effective. Multiple, repeated injections of MSCs appear to be even more effective than single injections [37,38].\n\nMethodology:\n\nA Prospective study from April 2019 onwards (Approximately Five years or till completion of sample requirements with minimum one year of follow up) will be conducted in Bangladesh LASER & Cell Surgery Institute & Hospital , Dhaka. 31 Patients of CKD who fulfill the selection criteria and admitted at the selected health care facility for treatment will be included in the study. SVF (stromal vascular fraction) will be collected from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Subsequent processing ( Incubation, centrifugation, mixing, washing & neutralization ) will produce final viable & active SVF (ADSCs) cell which will be transfused intravenously. Considering the possibility of further damage of the already damaging or damaged kidney during angiography and placement of catheter into the renal artery, the investigators opt for intra-venous transfusion of the SVF. Before transfusion sample will be collected & cell counting will be done using automated fluorescent cell counter."

                              "The role of MSCs as a novel treatment in ARDS. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are a mononuclear cell population that have the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages, and bone, cartilage and adipocyte cells in particular. Cell-based therapies have been termed the \"next pillar of Medicine\". MSCs constitute an innovative approach with substantial therapeutic promise for ARDS. MSCs possess several favorable biological characteristics, including convenient isolation, ease of expansion in culture while maintaining genetic stability, minimal immunogenicity and feasibility for allogenic transplantation.\n\nMSCs reduce inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance during rodent and murine bacterial pneumonia, and augment repair of the animal and human lung. Large animal studies have also replicated these beneficial effects. Bone marrow derived (BM) hMSCs decreased acute lung injury (ALI), without producing organ toxicity, in endotoxin injured pigs. Two randomised small phase 1 studies of plastic adherent MSCs in patients with ARDS have taken place. In Japan, investigators used adipose-derived plastic adherent cells in a small cohort (n=12) of patients with ARDS randomized 1:1 to MSCs or placebo: showing that the cells were safe and well-tolerated in this patient group, and were associated with reduced plasma levels of the alveolar epithelial cell injury marker SP-D. In the US Matthay has completed the phase 1 START trial, using a dose escalation study of plastic adherent bone marrow derived MSCs, in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. START showed that marrow derived MSCs at similar doses to those proposed in this study are safe and well-tolerated, (n=9), with a trend to reduced lung injury in the group treated with the highest (10x10^6cells/kg) compared with the lower doses, 1-5x10^6cells/kg.\n\nCurrent (20 March 2020) data on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that it causes a mortality rate of ~3.4%, compared with <0.1% with seasonal influenza. ARDS occurs in approximatel 20% cases of COVID-19 and respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. In a restropective multi-centre study of 150 confirmed cases in Wuhan, China, ARDS occured in significantly greater proportion of non-survivors 81% (55/68 patients) compared with only 9% survivors (7/82 patients); p<0.01. In another study of 193 confirmed COVID-19 cases, ARDS was observed at a significantly higher rate in non-survivors 93% (50/54 patients) compared with survivors, 7% (9/137) patients; p<0.0001.\n\nDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, MSCs have been administered in a pilot study of seven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A single infusion of 1 x 10^6 MSCs were administered intravenously when their condition was considered to be deteriorating despite other treatments, however only 1 of the 7 patients required critical care and mechanical ventilation. 4 patients were described as severe with compromise of respiratory function. Patients underwent follow up for 14 days and no infusional toxicity or adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial design:\n\nThe phase 1 trial is an open label dose escalation pilot study in which cohorts of subjects with moderate to severe ARDS will receive increasing doses of a single infusion of Realist Orbcel-C in a 3+3 design. We initially plan 3 cohorts with 3 subjects/cohort. Planned doses for the 3 cohorts pending absence of safety concerns are 100 x 10^6 cells, 200 x 10^6 cells and 400 x 10^6 cells.\n\nIn the completed Phase 1 REALIST trial, infusion of 400 million cells was achieved without any dose limiting toxicity at day 7 and has been approved by the DMEC as the intervention for this study.\n\nThe phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, allocation concealed placebo-controlled study using the 400x10^6 cell dose of Realist Orbcel-C in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to either COVID-19 or other causes of ARDS.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo assess the safety of a single intravenous infusion of REALIST ORBCEL-C cells in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nIn patients with moderate to severe ARDS to determine the effect of a single intravenous infusion of REALIST ORBCEL-C cells on:\n\nPhysiological indices of respiratory dysfunction reflecting severity of ARDS, as measured by oxygenation index (OI), respiratory compliance, and P/F ratio.\nSequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.\nExtubation and reintubation\nVentilation free days at day 28\nDuration of ventilation\nLength of ICU and hospital stay\n28-day and 90-day mortality\n\nPopulation:\n\nPatients will be prospectively screened daily. All patients with moderate to severe ARDS will be entered into a screening log. If possible during the phase 2 trial, all patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes of ARDS will be entered into a screening log. If the patient is not recruited the reason will be recorded. A fully anonymised minimal dataset will be recorded on these patients (age, gender, APACHE II score, worst P/F ratio at time of assessment, reasons for non-enrolment and vital status). APACHE II score and vital status will be collected using anonymised linkage to the ICNARC database through a defined CMP number (or equivalent). This will allow comparison to identify that the study population is representative of the overall cohort of patients. This information is required to establish an unbiased study population and to ensure the study can be reported in keeping with CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org).\n\nPatient consent:\n\nInformed consent procedure:\n\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The chief investigator (CI) (or designee) is responsible for ensuring that informed consent for trial participation is given by each patient or a legal representative. An appropriately trained doctor or nurse may take consent. The person taking informed consent must be GCP trained, suitably qualified and experienced and have been delegated this duty on the delegation log. Appropriate signatures and dates must be obtained on the informed consent documentation prior to collection of trial data and administration of the trial drug. If no consent is given a patient cannot be randomised into the trial. The incapacitating nature of the condition precludes obtaining prospective informed consent from participants. In this situation informed consent will be sought from a Personal Legal Representative or Professional Legal representative.\n\nPersonal legal representative consent:\n\nInformed consent will be sought from the patient's personal legal representative (Per LR) who may be a relative, partner or close friend. The Per LR will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and provided with a copy of the covering statement for the Per LR with an attached participant information sheet (PIS) and asked to give an opinion as to whether the patient would object to taking part in such medical research. If the Per LR decides that the patient would have no objection to participating in the trial the Per LR will be asked to sign the Per LR consent form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the Per LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical records.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there are likely to be visiting restrictions in place due to infection control measures and therefore it may not be possible to obtain consent from the PerLR at the clinical site. If the PerLR is not available at the site, the research may contact the PerLR by telephone and seek verbal agreement. The verbal agreement will be recorded in the PerLR Telephone Agreement Form.\n\nProfessional legal representative consent:\n\nAs the patient is unable to give informed consent and no Per LR is available, a doctor who is not connected with the conduct of the trial may act as a professional legal representative (Prof LR). The doctor will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and given a copy of the PIS. If the doctor decides that the patient is suitable for entry into the trial that doctor will be asked to sign the professional legal representative consent form. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the Prof LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical records.\n\nRetrospective patient consent:\n\nPatients will be informed of their participation in the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team once the patient regain capacity to understand the details of the trial. The responsible clinician or a member of the research team will discuss the study with the patient and the patient will be given a copy of the PIS to keep. The patient will be asked for consent to participate in the trial and to sign the consent to continue form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the trial site file and a copy given to the patient and another copy placed in the patients' medical records. Where consent to continue is not obtained, consent from the legal representative will remain valid. If the patient refuses consent, permission to use data collected to that point and to access medical records for trial data will be requested from the patient.\n\nWithdrawal of consent:\n\nPatients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by Per LR or Prof LR) from the trial at any time without prejudice.\n\nIn the event of a request to withdraw from the study, the researcher will determine which elements of the trial are to be withdrawn from the following possibilities and this will be documented:\n\nOrbcel-C administration if ongoing\nOn-going data collection during hospital admission\nConfirmation of vital status\nOn-going data collection following hospital discharge In the event that the request is to withdraw from all elements of the study, only anonymised data recorded up to the point of withdrawal will be included in the study analysis.\n\nConsent will also be requested to use the samples collected to that point.\n\nInvestigational medicinal product\n\nThe Investigational Medicinal Products are:\n\nAllogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as a sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension containing a fixed cell dose of either 100 x 10^6, 200 x 10^6 or 400 x 10^6 cells in 10mL, 20mL or 40mL volumes, respectively to be further diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for the purposes of administration.\nPlasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls) as the placebo control solution.\n\nStorage, thawing and reconstitution of Orbcel-C cells:\n\nTrial guidelines will provide detailed information regarding the protocol for storage, thawing and reconstitution, and administration of the cell product Orbcel-C and placebo.\n\nDrug storage:\n\nThe study drug will be commenced as soon as possible following reconstitution and within 6 hours.\n\nStudy drug termination criteria:\n\nStudy drug will be continued until one of the following is met:\n\nStudy drug related adverse event\nDeath or discontinuation of active treatment\nRequest from Per LR or Pro LR to withdraw the patient from the study\nDecision by the attending clinician on safety grounds.\n\nStudy drug compliance:\n\nAny omission of the study drug will be recorded in the CRF to monitor compliance.\n\nStudy drug accountability:\n\nThe site clinical trials pharmacist and cell therapy facility staff will maintain full accountability for the study drug received, prepared and dispensed to patients in ICU. Records will be kept allowing traceability between the cell donor and the IMP recipient. Drug administration will be recorded on the patient's prescription chart.\n\nStudy drug return and destruction:\n\nAny partially used study drug should be disposed of/destroyed at the site in accordance with Trial guidelines and local biological waste management policies.\n\nUnused product should disposed of/destroyed under the supervision of the site clinical trials pharmacist. Records of return and destruction will be maintained.\n\nData Quality:\n\nThe NICTU will provide training to site staff on trial processes and procedures including CRF completion and data collection. Within the NICTU the clinical data management process is governed by SOPs to ensure standardisation and adherence to International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements. Data is to be entered onto the electronic database as per the CRF entry timelines. On-site monitoring visits during the trial will check: (i) the accuracy of the data entered into the CRF, (ii) entries against source documents alongside adherence to the protocol, (iii) trial specific procedures and (iv) Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This monitoring will be carried out as per the trial specific Monitoring Plan. Changes to data will be recorded and fully auditable. Data errors will be documented and corrective actions implemented. Data validation will be implemented and discrepancy reports will be generated following data entry to identify data that may be out of range or inconsistent, or protocol deviations, based on data validation checks programmed into the clinical trial database. For routinely collected clinical data the NHS record will be the source document and for study specific measurements the CRF will be the source document.\n\nData management:\n\nThe PI (or designee) will collect all data and record this in the CRF. Each participant will be allocated a unique participant study number at trial entry, and this, and initials, will be used to identify him or her on the CRF for the duration of the trial. Data will be collected from the time of trial entry until hospital discharge. Trial data will be entered onto a CRF and processed electronically as per NICTU SOPs and the study specific Data Management Plan (DMP). Submitted data will be reviewed for completeness and entered onto a secure, backed-up custom database. Due care will be taken to ensure data safety and integrity, and compliance with GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Data queries will be raised electronically. The designated site staff will be required to respond to these queries within 2 weeks and send them back to the CTU after the queries have been reviewed and signed by the CI/delegated staff member. Any amended information will then be entered in the study database. A copy of the signed data query form should be retained with the CRF at the investigator site.\n\nIf the participant is transferred to another hospital the PI or designated member of the site study team will liaise with the receiving hospital to ensure complete data capture as per CRF instruction. If this is not possible, the primary outcome must be collected as a minimum. CRFs are to be submitted to the CTU as per the CRF submission schedule. Data censorship for each trial will occur 90 days post randomisation.\n\nAnalysis Population The primary analysis will be conducted on all outcome data obtained from all participants regardless of protocol adherence, i.e. intention to treat analysis.\n\nIt is possible that some enrolled subjects may not be treated with study drug. Therefore a secondary analysis of the all-treated population analysis will be undertaken.\n\nFor the Phase 1 trial no formal statistical analysis will be performed on safety data. The primary analysis will be descriptive and will focus on adverse events. The number of pre specified cell infusion associated events will also be reported. Descriptive analysis of pulmonary and non-pulmonary organ function will also be undertaken. We plan to publish the data from the phase 1 study.\n\nIn the completed Phase 1 REALIST trial, infusion of 400 million cells was achieved without any dose limiting toxicity at day 7 and has been approved by the DMEC as the intervention dose for this study.\n\nFor the Phase 2 trial, adverse events will be reported as for the Phase 1 study. For continuously distributed outcomes, differences between groups will be tested using independent samples t-tests and analysis of covariance with transformations of variables to normality if appropriate, or non-parametric equivalents. Chi-square tests (or Fisher's Exact tests) will be used for categorical variables. A p value of 0.05 will be considered as significant.\n\nCorrelations between changes in the biological markers measured and physiological and clinical outcomes will be assessed by appropriate graphical and statistical methods including Pearson's (or Spearman's) correlation coefficient.\n\nA final analysis and report of the Phase 1 study is planned following the last patient's 90 day follow up. A final analysis and report of the phase 2 study is planned following the last patient's 90 day follow up. The 2 year follow up data will be published thereafter and will be an important long term outcome. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and approved by the independent DMEC prior to any analysis.\n\nAll the power calculations and methodology for data analysis have been confirmed by the trial statistician from the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU).\n\nMissing data:\n\nEvery effort will be made to minimise missing baseline and outcome data in this trial. The level and pattern of the missing data in the baseline variables and outcomes will be established by forming appropriate tables and the likely causes of any missing data will be investigated. This information will be used to determine whether the level and type of missing data has the potential to introduce bias into the analysis results for the proposed statistical methods, or substantially reduce the precision of estimates related to treatment effects. If necessary, these issues will be dealt with using multiple imputation or Bayesian methods for missing data as appropriate.\n\nSample size:\n\nThe phase 1 trial will recruit up to 18 participants. The sample size for the phase 2 REALIST trial is 60 patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and 60 patients with ARDS not due to COVID-19 (30 in each of the ORBCEL-C and placebo groups). Due to the clinical differences in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and other causes of ARDS, patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and other causes of ARDS will be recruited as separate cohorts. This will also facilitate timely reporting of the results from each cohort.\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the phase 2 trial is safety, there is, however, power to detect a difference in physiological outcomes.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure will be the difference in oxygenation index (OI) between the ORBCEL-C and placebo treated groups at day 7. Based on our data from a recently completed clinical trial in ARDS, the mean (standard deviation; SD) OI at day 7 in patients with ARDS is 62(51)cmH2O/kPa [4]. To allow 1:1 recruitment (ORBCEL-C vs placebo) a sample size of 56 subjects will have 80% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 using a two-sample t-test to detect a clinically significant difference of 39 cmH2O/kPa in OI between groups. In a previous phase 2 study of similar size, we have found that an intervention can demonstrate a change in OI of a similar magnitude confirming a treatment effect of this size can be achieved [4].\n\nAlthough we anticipate few withdrawals or loss to follow-up we have allowed for this in the sample size calculation. In previous UK multicentre studies in the critically ill <3% withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up [4, 65]. Therefore, a conservative drop-out rate of 5% has been estimated and the study will require a total of 60 patients (30 patients in the ORBCEL-C and 30 in the placebo group)."

                              "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common malignant mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs usually appear like subepithelial lesions covered by normal mucosa, arising from the second of fourth layer of the gastrointestinal tract wall. They are variable in size and mostly asymptomatic, but they can present different clinical behavior as bleeding, pain, or obstruction. The tumor size, location and mitotic rate are important prognostic factors. For resectable tumors >2 cm, surgery is the treatment of choice; the management of tumors <2 cm remains debatable because they present unclear clinical significance and low risk of malignancy. Endoscopic treatment, when complete resection it's possible, could be an option to full thickness laparoscopic resection. Moreover, around 90% of GISTs harbour driver mutation in KIT and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA), making the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e., imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib) a suitable option for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Nevertheless, the role of local treatment in advanced and metastatic disease is limited, with few retrospective studies suggesting tumor ablation as a therapeutic approach.\n\nAccording to literature, thermal ablation has been successfully used for local treatment of hepatic metastases from GISTs (as a curative treatment). However, its feasibility and technical success as a local treatment in esophageal, gastric or intestinal GISTs has not been evaluated.\n\nThe investigators aimed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the RFA electrode developed by Taewong Medical for the treatment of resectable GISTs (esophageal, gastric and intestinal lesions) as well as its limited liver metastases in na\u00efve patients or patients with stable disease following systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The challenge is whether to introduce local ablative therapy as curative or as part of multimodal treatment in patients with GISTs to obtain a curable disease and an increase in overall survival for metastatic patients."

After signing an ICF, subjects underwent screening procedures on Day 1 prior to the first study product application to determine eligibility. Once eligible, all subjects (n=10) received topical treatment with the MSC exosome ointment immediately followed by Vesiderm liposome cream TID on the forearm with a gap of 4 hours between doses.\n\nThe study consisted of the following periods:\n\nA Screening Period of 1 day (Day 1)\nA Treatment Period of 20 days (Day 1 to 20)\nAn End of Study (EOS) Period of 1 day (Day 21 [+3 days]).\n\nScreening Period\n\nThe subjects were screened for eligibility on Day 1 prior to the application of the study product. Subjects were asked to sign the ICF after having the study described to them. After obtaining written informed consent, subjects underwent the following screening procedures for participation in the study:\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria assessments\nVital signs\nMedical history\nDemographic data review\nStandard hematology panel\nRenal panel\nLiver function test\nInflammatory blood examinations\nPregnancy test (if applicable)\nConcomitant medications\n\nIdentification, visual assessment, and photography of application area\n\nA trained expert evaluator (an Investigator or designee) identified the area of study product application and performed visual assessments which were carried out using an adapted version of SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scale and visual assessment score (VAS). A photograph of the area of application was also taken using a dedicated compact digital camera at the clinic where subject visits were done.\n\nTreatment Period\n\nAfter confirmation of the application site, the subjects applied exosome ointment along with Vesiderm liposome cream (TID per day). Each day (from Day 1 to 20), the study product was applied with a gap of 4 hours between each dose to a healthy area (one hand area) on the forearm using 1 fingertip unit (FTU). The Vesiderm liposome cream was meant to keep the application site moisturized.\n\nAll through the treatment period, the subjects completed the Subject Diary to capture adverse events (AEs; skin-related and other), concomitant medications, and time of study product application.\n\nThe site coordinator called the subjects every 3 days (Days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) to follow up on the investigational product's (IP) compliance, and if subjects had any adverse events or had taken any concomitant medications during the period. Any AEs reported by the subject during the calls were to be referred to the investigator for appropriate review and follow-up.\n\nEnd of Study (EOS) Period\n\nThe EOS period was on Day 21 (+3 days). The subjects visited the clinic on this day for the assessments such as vital signs, blood examinations (hematology, chemistry, and inflammatory blood examinations), photographs of the area of application, visual assessment of the area of application, AEs, and concomitant medications used.\n\nThe assessments at this visit were also to be conducted in case of early termination or withdrawal of any subject."

Participants whose tumors have an activating mutation in exon 11 of cellular KIT (KIT) will be enrolled into Cohort A. Participants whose tumors have other activating mutations will be enrolled into in Cohort B.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess clinical benefit in participants with KIT exon 11-mutant GIST (Cohort A) defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR), which is the composite of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting greater than or equal to (>=) 16 weeks per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) as a measure of disease control. The secondary objective is to assess clinical benefit in participants with GIST that lacks an activating KIT exon 11 mutation (Cohort B) and in the total participant population. The efficacy assessments are tumor response using RECIST Version 1.1, modified for GIST and assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The safety assessments include routine physical and laboratory evaluations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring. Other assessments include optional 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET); optional pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsy for pharmacodynamic studies; and pharmacokinetics (PK). It is estimated that accrual will be complete within 1 year; the total estimated duration of the study is 3 years."

                              "BACKGROUND:\n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, and traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy is not effective. Patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing GIST, and surgery remains the only standard treatment option for NF1-related GIST. While the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and sunitinib prolong survival in patients with KIT/PDGFRA mutated GIST, they have no documented efficacy in patients with NF1 related GISTs, which lack KIT/PDGFRA mutations. Radiation therapy also seems to be ineffective. Therefore, new therapies are needed.\nSelumetinib (AZD6244 hyd sulfate), a novel orally bioavailable mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor, is a specific inhibitor of MEK 1/2, which is currently undergoing evaluation in adults with refractory cancers, in adults and children with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and children with brain tumors. Evaluation of selumetinib in children and young adults with NF1 related plexiform neurofibromas (PN) has demonstrated activity with most patients demonstrating some PN shrinkage, and a partial response rate of 71%. Selumetinib has also demonstrated activity in children with NF1 and low-grade gliomas. It is thus possible that selumetinib may mediate anti-tumor effects in NF1 GIST by inhibition of downstream signaling of Ras.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n- To estimate the response rate (radiologic response as defined by RECIST v1.1) of selumetinib in children and adults with measurable NF1-mutated GIST which is unresectable, progressive or metastatic.\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\nPatients who are greater than or equal to 3 years of age and able to swallow capsules, with a histologically or cytologically confirmed measurable GIST without Kit or PDGFRA mutation, who have a clinical diagnosis of NF1 or a mutation of NF1 in the GIST.\nPatients tumors must demonstrate progression within the past 12 months or be metastatic; patients who do not meet this criterion will be followed, on the NF1 Natural History Study if appropriate; in the event that they demonstrate subsequent progression they may be enrolled.\nPatients must have adequate major organ function, adequate performance status, and normal LVEF by ECHO.\nNo prior medical therapy is required; patients should have surgical resection if this is deemed feasible without unacceptable morbidity. Patients must meet the time requirements since prior therapy and have recovered from prior therapy toxicities.\nNo prior treatment with selumetinib or another specific MEK1/2 inhibitor is permitted.\n\nDESIGN:\n\nSelumetinib will be administered at a starting dose of 50 mg/dose orally in patients 18 years or older and 25 mg/m^2/dose in children < 18 years of age; drug will be given twice daily continuously in the absence of toxicity or disease progression, using 28-day cycles. The pediatric dose is the recommended phase II dose of selumetinib determined in a CTEP sponsored phase I trial of selumetinib for children and young adults with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and the adult dose is equal to that used in our phase II study of adults with NF1 and inoperable PN. Adults will be allowed a one-time intrapatient dose escalation to 75mg BID provided the drug is well tolerated during the first cycle. Patients will be asked to co-enroll on POB protocol 10-C-0086: \"Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of a Repository for Related Biological Studies and 08-C-0079: Natural History Study and Longitudinal Assessment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1\".\nPatients will be monitored for toxicity and response.\nResponse will be assessed on a regular schedule. FDG-PET will be obtained at baseline prior to therapy, on day 11 (+/- 3 days) to assess for early FDG-PET response (optional), after 3 cycles and as clinically indicated.\nThis study will use a Simon optimal two-stage phase II design with a target response rate of 25%, enrolling a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 16 evaluable patients. A maximum accrual of 20 patients may be accrued allowing for a small number (4) of inevaluable patients."

Patients who have had prior GIST-directed surgery may enroll provided they have measurable disease.\nSince selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for GIST or other tumor manifestations associated with NF1.\nPatients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy, such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, imatinib or other targeted therapies are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN and patients who received previous GIST-directed therapy must either demonstrate progression as defined by RECIST, or be unable to tolerate their previous therapy.

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform her treating physician immediately. Please note that the selumetinib\n\nmanufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients should be used for 16 weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle.\n\nAll patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent.\nWillingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if sun exposure is anticipated.\nWillingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the study, as these may affect selumetinib metabolism.\nAlthough not a requirement, participants will be asked to also participate in protocol 10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of a Repository for Related Biological Studies. Patients with NF1 will be asked to coenroll\n\non the NF1 Natural History Study and 08-C-0079: Natural History Study and Longitudinal Assessment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nPatients with evidence of another malignancy or benign tumor requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy are excluded; however, those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma requiring treatment will be eligible as selumetinib has documented activity in plexiform neurofibromas.\nPatients with a diagnosis of NF1 and GIST who do not meet other eligibility criteria may enroll on the NF1 Natural History Study, and will be followed on this study. Should they require therapy for GIST based on evidence of progression, they may then enroll on study.\nPatients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\nPrior therapy with selumetinib or another specific MEK inhibitor is not permitted.\nHistory of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to selumetinib or other agents used in study.\nPrevious MEK, RAS, or RAF inhibitor use.\nPatients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first three cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation may affect analysis of adherence and/or make the subject inevaluable.\nPatients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n\nPatients with the following cardiac conditions are excluded:\n\nUncontrolled hypertension (Adults: blood pressure [BP] of greater than or equal to 150/95 despite medical support/management. Participants 18 years of age and younger should have a blood pressure less than or equal to 95th percentile for age, height and gender.

Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\nNo supplementation with vitamin E is permitted because the selumetinib capsules contain vitamin E\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\nPregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of selumetinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with selumetinib.\nHIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with selumetinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\nOngoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy directed at the tumor. Those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma requiring treatment will be eligible, as selumetinib has documented activity in plexiform neurofibromas.\nPatients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study."

Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group. In interventional group we will collect SVF from recipients with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of living-relative kidney transplantation during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. We will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in living-relative donor kidney transplantation.

                              "Patients and Methods\n\nPatients with newly diagnosed GI SETs will be prospectively enrolled at 8 university hospitals in Korea between May and December 2016, if they met the following criteria: having a hypoechoic mass in the submucosal and/or proper muscle layers on the basis of EUS and tumor >2 cm in size. Exclusion criteria are: SETs were not located in the submucosal and/or proper muscle layers on EUS; EUS revealed the characteristic findings of lipoma, cyst, vessel or extraluminal lesions; the platelet count was <50,000/mm3 and prothrombin time was <50%; or the patient did not provide consent to undergo the study. This study is approved by the Institutional Review Board of each hospital and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All enrolled patients provide written informed consents to participate in the study.\n\nTechnique for EUS-FNB\n\nAll procedures are performed by using a linear array echoendoscope (Olympus UCT-140, UCT-240; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan or PentaxEG-3870UTK; Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) with the patients placed in the left lateral decubitus position under conscious sedation.\n\nBefore the study commenced, all participating endosonographers discuss the procedural steps in detail. Technical details of the standard tissue-acquisition protocol are as follows. After the target lesion is endosonographically visualized and the region scanned for SETs using color or pulsed Doppler, FNB is performed at the esophagus, stomach, duodenum or rectum, depending on the lesion location. The needle is advanced into the target tissue under endosonographic guidance.\n\nAfter penetrating the lesion, the endosonographer moves the needle to-and-fro for more than 10 to 15 times within the lesion while an assistant simultaneously pulled out the stylet slowly and continuously over 20 s to achieve minimal negative pressure within the needle (slow-pull technique). Finally, the needle is withdrawn from the lesion. At least three needle passes are performed using the designated needle, and if a diagnostic or technical failure is encountered, the patient is switched to the alternative needle according to the judgment of the endosonographers.\n\nPreparation for histological analysis\n\nBecause pathologists are absent during endoscopy, FNB samples are recovered and stored for subsequent processing by the endosonographers. The specimens are then expressed onto slides by using a stylet or by flushing with air into the needle assembly, to harvest the core samples from the needle. The endosonographers then carefully inspect the material on the slides for the presence of tissue cores defined as whitish pieces of tissue with apparent bulk, which are measured and then lifted off the slides and placed into a formalin bottle. The core samples are macroscopically assessed as a definite tissue core; suspicious tissue core mixed with blood clots; or only blood or scarce sample without any tissue core. The former two sample types are considered macroscopically optimal core samples.\n\nIf tissue cores are obtained, they are fixed in formalin and stained in hematoxylin and eosin for evaluation by pathologists. Samples with tissue cores are graded as optimal or suboptimal: optimal, if the material allows satisfactory assessment of histologic architecture and immunohistochemical evaluation, such as c-kit, CD34, S-100, or smooth muscle actin, if indicated, and suboptimal, if the histological core is inadequate for the abovementioned assessments. Because the morphological characteristics of mesenchymal tumors are nonspecific, a positive diagnosis by EUS-FNB is only considered true positive when immunohistochemical analysis is conclusive. Conventional cytological analysis is additionally performed in most cases or if a core sample is unavailable. Cytological material is sent to the cytologists as a fixed or an air-dried slide. The gold standard is the histopathological assessment of the resected specimens for patients who underwent endoscopic resection or surgery, and the assessment of the FNB samples for those who did not.\n\nOutcome parameters\n\nThe primary outcome parameter is diagnostic sufficiency. Diagnostic sufficiency is defined as the proportion of patients in whom the histopathological diagnosis could be established within three needle passes. The percentage of cases in which the pathologist classified the quality of the sample as optimal for histological evaluation is also evaluated. The secondary outcome measures are rates of diagnostic failure, technical failure, and complications. Diagnostic failure is defined as failure to obtain sufficient core samples even after three passes, and technical failure is defined as malfunction of the needle before three needle passes. Complications are defined as any deviation from the clinical course after EUS-guided sampling, as observed by the endosonographers or recovery suite nurses, or as reported by patients. Excessive bleeding at the site of puncture, perforation, hypotension, and need for reversal medication are documented."

                              "Tendon disorders compromise pain free activity and often progress to chronic pain with a major impact on quality of life. More than 85,000 patients each year see their general practitioner (GP) with Achilles Tendinopathy (AT) which affects the lower leg in young and middle aged adults. The main treatment is physiotherapy, although surgery is eventually considered in 25-45%of patients, an intervention that requires several months of immobilisation and has unpredictable outcomes.\n\nOther treatments include, shockwave therapy, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (a blood injection of platelet rich plasma) and steroid injections, but other than physiotherapy non have been shown to be better than placebo. There is a need for improved nonsurgical treatments. There is an established treatment in horses that involves injection of the horses own stem cells into the tendon, which has been shown to be effective but has never been used in man. We wish to translate the technology to humans and propose a pilot phase II trial to establish the safety of stem cells implanted in diseased human tendon. We aim to study 10 patients with chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy to assess safety as our primary outcome measure. In addition we capture clinical outcomes scores and ultrasound appearances. Other than the stem cell injection, all assessments will be non invasive. Participants will be otherwise healthy adults, aged 18-70 and recruited from routine outpatient clinics at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, presenting with a painful heel, diagnosed by a specialist as Achilles tendinopathy, and having already undergone a minimum of 6 months of physiotherapy. Each participant will have 6 months follow up. This study will help inform a larger clinical trial in the future for which a further ethics application will be made."
