Higher scores indicate better motor function. The primary endpoint in this study was computed from the GMFM-66 score in three steps: 1) The \"observed\" change in motor function from Baseline to Month 12 was calculated (positive values indicate improvement, negative values indicate reduction, and zero indicates no change) for each participant; and 2) The expected change in motor function was determined for each participant based on published growth curves; and 3) The expected change in GMFM-66 was subtracted from the observed change to yield the final primary outcome. Positive values indicate a greater change than would be expected, zero indicates change as expected, and negative values indicate a smaller amount of change than would be expected."

Binomial confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level and p-values for these groups will be calculated. Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore the effect of administration of MSCs on the composite endpoint at 6-months of death, amputation revision and gangrene, and will be compared to historical cohorts.

Within each of these categories adverse events will be listed in descending order of frequency for the treatment-group. In addition for each category, the sum and difference between the two routes of delivery of the proportions will be reported as percent incidence. Confidence Intervals at the 95% confidence level and P-values for these four groups will be calculated. Since four previous trials have not reported adverse events with MSC treatment, confidence intervals will be generated by the method of the Wilson Score Interval."
