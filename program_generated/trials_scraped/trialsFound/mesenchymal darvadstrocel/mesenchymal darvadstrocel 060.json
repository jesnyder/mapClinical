Safety and efficacy of the procedure has been sufficiently demonstrated and the Spanish Agency of Medication approved its application a few months ago. Being aware about the difficulties to a proper application and management of the stem cells the Spanish Stem Cell therapy group devised, in a joint activity with the Spanish Group GERM (Grupo Espa\u00f1ol de Rehabilitacion Multimodal) dedicated to expand the best surgical clinical practices, a national project for the application of the therapy. The objective is to get a homogeneous implementation in all hospitals in Spain that have being baked to use this biological therapy."
