The allogeneic IMP allo-APZ2-CVU contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive dermal mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.\n\nPatients will be randomized to be treated with allo-APZ2-CVU (dose 1, dose 2, dose 3) or placebo (50 patients per dose group). The patients will undergo treatment with the IMP on Day 0 (V3) and will be followed up for efficacy for 18 weeks (V4 until V14). Two safety follow-up visits will be performed at Month 6 (V15) and Month 10 (V16).\n\nThe wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size measurement will start at the first Screening Visit (V1) and will be measured at each following on-site visit.\n\nPain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires."

The IMP incorporating the ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied on the wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia (on Day 0 and Week 6.1).\n\nWound measurements from Visit (V) 2 and V9 will be used to determine the cell amount for the IMP treatments on V3 and V10, respectively.\n\nPatients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.\n\nThe wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing. The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.\n\nPain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-CVU three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 after the first IMP applications are included."
