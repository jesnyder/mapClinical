Clinically observed initial findings and an extensive body of research indicate regenerative treatments are both safe and effective for the treatment of multiple conditions.\n\nThis study investigates clinical outcomes of treatments for numerous indications including: Autoimmune, Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Integumentary, Neurologic / Neurodegenerative, Pulmonary, Orthopedic Diseases, Sexual Dysfunction, Urologic Disorders and Viral Illnesses.\n\nOur hypotheses posit that regenerative treatments are both safe and statistically beneficial for a range of conditions. Outcomes will be determined by multiple valid outcome instruments that measure general quality of life information along with condition-specific information."
