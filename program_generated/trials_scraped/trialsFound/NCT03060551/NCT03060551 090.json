Adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is increasingly recognized as an easily accessible source of regenerative cells with therapeutic potential in ischaemic or autoimmune disease. The investigators aimed to measure for the first time the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of autologous SVF cells local injections in patients with SSc with hand disability."
