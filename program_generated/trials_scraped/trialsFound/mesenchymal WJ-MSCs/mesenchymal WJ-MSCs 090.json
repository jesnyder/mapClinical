                              "There are more than 100 types of arthritis, and the most common ones are rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The main cause of its pathogenesis is the compensatory hyperplasia of the articular cartilage caused by the body's degenerative changes, which will eventually cause the joint to partially or completely lose its function.\n\nIn the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made to treat OA. The treatment of OA changes with the development of the patient's condition. At present, there are many diagnosis and treatment options for knee OA, including conservative treatment and surgical treatment. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to postpone or terminate the course of OA.\n\nCell therapy for OA has developed rapidly in recent years and has received widespread attention. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with potential of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells are extracted from the patient's body and then implanted back. Their ability of regeneration and reproduction can fill the damaged cartilage tissue, so as to achieve an effective treatment of the joint damage.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction of joint pain, and restoration of joint function."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, long-term allograft survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade.\n\nA promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use without the delay required for expansion.\n\nAlthough it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged, they could possibly elicit an anti-donor immune response, which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and impact the allograft survival on the long term. These safety issues should be studied before further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting.\n\nMSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at increased risk for developing immune mediated injury. In addition, a large amount of the kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis which so importantly affects long term survival. MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk."

In recent years, full endoscopic discectomy has been widely used in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation due to its advantages of reduced trauma, enhanced recovery and less cost. However, the reherniation of the residual nucleus pulposus still exist after nerve root decompression. It is urgent to use stem cell and tissue engineering to replace the resection tissue and repair the residual nucleus pulposus for disc resealing. To observe the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) in the treatment of lumbar disc degeneration. This clinical trial is aimed to include a single group of 20 patients with lumbar disc herniation. Twenty million hUCMSCs will be injected into the lumbar disc of the enrolled patients in this non-random, self-controlled and single-dose open study design. The patients will be followed up for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the injection to evaluate the safety of the patients after grafting hUCMSCs. Additionally, improvement of patients' quality of life will be evaluated using the ODI score, VAS score and SF-36 score. Lumbar disc signals will be also quantified using MRI to demonstrate hUCMSCs transplantation could slow down lumbar disc degeneration."

SCI is not only a severe healthy problem but also a great social burden. To the best of our knowledge, cell therapy seems to be a promising alternative for the treatment of SCI due to numerous advantages. However, cytotherapy is still in its infancy since there are many disparities and uncertainties regarding subject selection, cellular type, transplantation timing, administration dose and deliver route in clinical trial protocols. Hence, a standardized well-designed clinical study is urgently required for the safe and effective treatment of SCI.\n\nIn this study, complete or incomplete cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar SCI subjects were recruited to join in a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial. Intervention is four times of subarachnoid administration of allogeneic hUC-MSCs. During the intervention and follow-up periods of this trial, any adverse event was identified rapidly and managed properly. The maximum intensity and relationship of any adverse event with hUC-MSCs administration were identified.The primary efficacy indicator is American spinal injury association (ASIA) total score at the fourth follow-up and SCI Functional Rating Scale of the International Association of Neurorestoratology (IANR-SCIFRS) total score at the fourth follow-up. Secondary efficacy indicators are these two indicators at the remaining time points, scores of pin prick, light touch, motor and sphincter, muscle spasticity and spasm, autonomic system, bladder and bowel functions, residual urine volume. Subgroup analysis of primary efficacy indicators was also performed.\n\nIn this trial, informed consent forms that had the approval of the institutional review board were obtained from all participants before recruitment. In this clinical study, subarachnoid transplantation of hUC-MSCs was performed a total of four times per subject with the delivery dose of 1\u00d710E6 cells/kg. After the completion of cytotherapy, subject was regularly followed up in the hospital at four time points, determined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the final administration of hUC-MSCs. At each time point of administration (the first, second, third, and fourth transplantation) and follow-up (the first, second, third, and fourth follow-up), safety and efficacy indicators were collected accordingly by two independent assessors."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term survival of transplanted kidneys has not improved accordingly in the last decades. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for many years, due to their efficacy in preventing acute rejection. However, CNI have nephrotoxic side effects that can directly contribute to renal dysfunction and compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently there is a strong interest in immunosuppressive (IS) regimens that maintain efficacy for the prevention of acute rejection, whilst reducing nephrotoxicity.\n\nIn this perspective the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with a mTor inhibitor (Everolimus (Certican\u00ae)) might be an optimal strategy to facilitate CNI (tacrolimus) withdrawal. MSCs have IS properties and roles in tissue repair and everolimus is a proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects. In experimental studies the combination of mTor inhibitor and MSCs was shown to attenuate alloimmune responses and to promote allograft tolerance.\n\nIn total 70 de novo renal recipients, 18-75 years of ages will be recruited from the transplant clinics of the LUMC. Thirty five of these patients will be included in the Certican/ and MSC group and 35 patients in the Certican/ standard dose tacrolimus group. Patients of the MSC treated groups will receive two doses of autologous BM derived MSCs IV, 7 days apart, 6 and 7 weeks after transplantation in combination with Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.). At the time of the second MSC infusion tacrolimus will be withdrawn in 2 weeks (after 1 week dose of tacrolimus will be halved, after 2 weeks stopped). Patients in the control group will receive Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.) and standard dose tacrolimus (through levels 6-8 ng/ml after 6 weeks).\n\nPrimary goal is evaluate whether concentration-controlled Certican\u00ae with MSCs compared to Certican\u00ae with standard tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients reduces fibrosis by quantitative Sirius Red scoring."

The study is a randomized parallel controlled study. The research process is as follows: 1. Twenty eligible patients with ischemic heart disease were recruited, fully informed, and signed a consent form, and randomly divided into CABG group (n=10) or CABG + stem cell treatment group (n=10); 2. CABG was performed under general anesthesia in both groups. In the cell therapy group, 1\u00d710^7 human umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were injected to the edge of the myocardial infarction area at 20 points at the same time in CABG; 3. Use vasoactive drugs and antibiotics to prevent infection one week after surgery. After the operation, before discharge, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after discharge, and once a year thereafter, until the death of the patient. Patients receive a review of which main content includes symptom improvement, cardiac function improvement, and adverse events."

Mesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. They have also been demonstrated to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nInvestigators will culture donated bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in a unique automated system, and infuse the cells in a fresh, replicating stage of growth. This study is to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease."

Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

WJ-MSCs from the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy."

The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.\n\nAbdominal fat will be harvested through a small incision and processed by the Mayo Clinic IMPACT laboratory using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and previously established standard operating procedures (SOPs) to produce clinical grade, autologous, culture-expanded AD-MSCs for subsequent intradiscal injection. All injections will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis. A final visit for evaluation and imaging will be conducted at the end of the study."

                              "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal malignancies that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, progressive bone marrow failure, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, and increased risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is a well-accepted theory that MDS and AML originate from primary alterations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) compartment, which confer a survival advantage to them at the expense of physiological hematopoiesis. More recently, there is growing evidences regarding the contribution of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment to the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. Of particular interest, several studies have pointed towards a pivotal role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), one of the main components of the BM niche, in the initiation and propagation of myeloid disorders. In this context, it is of clinical significance to better characterize the intrinsic defects harbored by MSC in MDS and AML context, as compared to physiological conditions. Such research initiative aims to dissect the cross-talk between malignant HSC and their BM partners in crime, further prospecting for innovative stromal-directed strategies for the treatment of MDS and AML."

                              "-Chemo-radiation enhances survival but also increases the risk of PRD. The result will be an increasing\n\nCost for society (repeated hospitalization for palliative care)\nAn ethical problem to help these patients with irreversible degraded quality of life.\n\nResults from conventional therapies for PRD reveal a poor long-term efficacy:\n\ni. Coagulation by plasma argon is insufficient, 58% at 6 months; ii. The efficacy of formalin is questionable (48%), as is 5-amino-salicylate, sulfasalazine, vitamin E and pentoxifylline ; iii. The efficacy of short chain fatty acids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is low (40%); iv. Steroids are of limited efficacy (37%). v. A surgical operation in an irradiated field is associated with difficult or impossible healing as well as with risks of infection (mortality of 5% within 40 months) Furthermore, conventional therapies are palliative and badly tolerated. More effective approaches are thus crucial.\n\nPRD unfortunately remains a major side effect of radiotherapy and there is no established effective treatment. Consequently, the recruitment of the aforementioned number of patients by participating radiotherapy centers is ensured.\n\nMSC therapy is a safe and suitable option in severe PRD.\n\nThe investigators propose a proof of concept.\nMSC production and injection protocol has already been successfully employed in compassionate therapy on four patients, who suffered from chronic and fistulizing colitis, after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.\n\nPRISME is a network project which includes St Antoine Hospital, INSERM (National Institute of Health and Medical Research), EFS (French Blood Establishment ), CTSA (Army Centre of Blood Transfusion) ECellFrance, IRSN (Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety), IGR (Gustave Roussy Institute), and Institute of cancerology of west France. Our consortium has robust experience of the treatment of radiation damages, preclinical models and the medical management of PRD using biotherapy. Clinical and scientific achievements, previous collaborations of the different groups and preliminary partner's data assure the fulfillment of the program.\n\nPatient selection will be performed by the six radiotherapy centers participating in this study. The expected recruitment per center had been concluded from the average number of potentially eligible patients treated and surveyed in each of the following centers (St Antoine Hospital, Gustave Roussy Institute, Institute of cancerology of west France).\nThe ECellFrance platform will ensure MSC production. This platform includes two locations in Parisian region: EFS (in the city of Creteil) and CTSA.\nSupport, trials and intervention protocols will be handled in the Department of Clinical Hematology at St Antoine Hospital, renowned for its expertise in the treatment of overdosed radiation therapy patients, i.e. Epinal cases) and which has managed a PHRC using MSCs.\nParticipation of a research group with robust experience in stem cells, transplantation (Research centre Saint Antoine, INSERM) and radiobiology, cell therapy treatment of radiation accidents (IRSN, CTSA). These groups will carry out the characterization of the biological activity and immunological properties of the native MSC bone marrow tissue in vitro (INSERM) and in vivo (IRSN) and immunological monitoring of patients treated with the MSC (INSERM).\n\nIt is expected to achieve the healing of chronic refractory diseases, leading to lower health expenses by reducing patient treatment and hospitalization, and to an increase in their quality of life by a:\n\nDecrease in rectorrhagia and hematuria, pain, drug-consumption;\nInhibition of hemorrhagic syndromes and chronic inflammation accompanied by a sustained fistulization arrest due to the repairing capability of MSC.\n\nThe expected results for the public will be the healing of chronic refractory diseases, leading to lower health expenses by reducing patient treatment and hospitalization, and to an increase in their quality of life.\n\nHypothesis: MSC injections provide an efficient alternative approach in the treatment of PRD for patient refractories to conventional treatments.\n\nPatient study scheduled:\n\nD-60: Screening by 6 radiotherapy centers. D-1: Inclusion in Saint Antoine Hospital. D0, D7 and D14: IV MSC injection (2x106 - 6x106/kg MSC). M2 and M4: follow-up visit. End of patient's participation to the study at M4. Total number of scheduled patients: 12 patients suffering from PRD. Simon minimax plan, P0=25%, P1=60%, Alpha=5% and Beta=20%.\n\nStopping rules:\n\nStep 1: (n1=5) inclusion of 5 patients r1=1: if the number of success is <2, the study will end for MSC inefficacy. If the number of success is \u22652, proceed to step 2. Step 2: (n2=7) inclusion of up to 7 patients r2=5: as soon as the number of successes reaches 6 (>r2), inclusions will be discontinued and MSC will be considered as sufficiently promising for further studies."

Based on the promising pre-clinical preliminary data and intriguing results in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia and ARDS as well as an established safety profile of MSC generally and in ARDS in particular, the researchers propose multiple dosing of MSCs as a study treatment to ameliorate the severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia and ARDS potentially improve survival.\n\nPatients will receive study agent (MSC or placebo) within 48 hours of enrollment.

The Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far, the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators' pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion criteria."

                              "Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (uc-MSC).\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design."

                              "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (acute-on-chronic liver failure, ACLF) is a special type of rapid deterioration of liver function that occurs on the basis of cirrhosis or non-cirrhosis, which is characterized by sequential multiple organ failure and high short-term (28 days) mortality (15%). ACLF was first proposed by Jalan R and Williams R. in 2002. It is a newly discovered type of critically ill liver disease characterized by high short-term mortality after hospitalization [1]. At present, the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF is not clear, and its definition in Europe and Asia-Pacific is still controversial. However, severe systemic inflammatory response is often closely related to the cause, accompanied by single or multiple organ failure are three important characteristics of ACLF. In the past ten years, the prevalence of ACLF has increased. Due to the rapid progress of the disease and the close relationship between mortality and organ failure, there is no effective method to improve the survival rate of ACLF patients except liver transplantation. The latest literature review shows that the 28-day and 90-day mortality rates are as high as 27.8-37.6% and 40-, respectively. 51.2%[2].\n\nIn 2013, European Association for the Study of Chronic Acute Liver Failure\uff08EASL-CLIF\uff09 conducted a prospective multi-center EASL-CLIF Chronic Acute Liver Failure (CANONIC) study in 29 liver disease treatment centers in eight European countries, and proposed chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment\uff08CLIF-SOFA\uff09score is used as the clinical diagnostic criteria for alcoholic and hepatitis B virus\uff08HBV\uff09related ACLF. According to the CLIF-SOFA score, the 90-day mortality rate of ACLF patients is as high as 51%, while that of non-ACLF patients is 10% [3]. The European CANONIC study also shows that systemic inflammation is the main driving force of multiple organ failure, which is a typical pathogenesis of ACLF patients with western liver cirrhosis [4]. For another, the current Asian ACLF diagnostic criteria is the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) criteria, which reached a consensus in 2009, and the guidelines were improved in 2014, but there is still a lack of multi-center, prospective evidence-based medical evidence to support . In 2016, led by the person in charge of this project, an oriental ACLF prospective multi-center observation cohort was established in China, which included 3970 ACLF high-risk patients, filling the gap in the natural course and mortality of oriental ACLF patients, and established a 90-day oriental ACLF diagnostic criteria for mortality [5]. The person in charge of this project also explored the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF patients in areas with high prevalence of oriental HBV. The study showed that submassive hepatic necrosis is an important histological feature in ACLF patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. The systemic inflammatory response of multiple organ failure caused by parenchymal liver cells has a similar mechanism to that of western alcoholic ACLF [6]. Although the causes of ACLF type are not the same in the East and the West, the cohorts from the East and the West have confirmed the short-term high mortality rate of ACLF. Systemic inflammation, sub-large necrosis, and aseptic inflammation may all important reasons that lead to multiple organ failure and eventual death of ACLF patients.\n\nDue to the high short-term mortality of ACLF and the limited liver source for liver transplantation, exploring new methods for the treatment of ACLF is a major issue facing clinical research. Mesenchymal stem cells have great application prospects in regenerative medicine because of their strong self-renewal, low immunogenicity, non-tumorigenicity and strong immune regulation ability[7]. Many previous documents have confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells in animal models can promote liver cell regeneration, resist inflammation, regulate local microenvironment and anti-fibrosis [8-10]. Among them, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) have attracted attention of researchers because they are easily obtained from the medical waste-the umbilical cord, are not invasive, and have high expansion capabilities in vitro [11]. The possible mechanism of UC-MSC in the treatment of end-stage liver disease is that it can repair the liver. At present, there are the following opinions: \u2460 Cell rehabilitation. In the case of liver failure, MSC can differentiate into hepatocytes and play an alternative therapeutic effect. A large number of studies have shown that MSC can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in different inducing factors and culture systems in vitro, capable of storing glycogen and urea synthesis. Function; \u2461Immune regulation. Studies have shown that MSC can regulate immune cells by secreting a variety of cytokines in the body, and play an immunomodulatory effect; \u2462Anti-fibrosis. MSC can induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis or inhibit its activation, and can secrete anti-fibrotic substances such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor and matrix metallopeptidase 9\uff08MMP-9\uff09to reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix and inhibit the formation of liver fibrosis.\n\nAccording to the results of a single-center clinical trial published by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in the previous period, there were no serious adverse reactions at 6 hours and 72 weeks after intravenous infusion of MSCs. The dose was (1-6)*10^7 cells/time for 4 times, confirming the safety and effectiveness of both low-dose and high-dose treatments. Another open clinical trial of Beijing 302 Hospital used mesenchymal stem cells at a dose of 5*10^5 cells/kg (based on the patient's weight of 60kg, the dose was 3*10^7 cells/time), excluded severe ACLF patients accompanied by severe infections and other sever complications. In addition, previous pharmacokinetic tests showed that the half-life of mesenchymal stem cells in animals is 3 days.\n\nTherefore, this research plans to carry out a single-center open clinical trial to confirm the safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ACLF, and provide stronger clinical evidence for the safety of UC-MSCs in the treatment of ACLF."

                              "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier between photoreceptor cells and choroidal blood vessels. Photoreceptor cells are vitally and functionally dependent on the RPE. The conversion of blood glucose to ATP, synthesis of proteins in the visual cycle and removal of metabolic waste takes place in the RPE. For these important processes, various peptide growth factors and their receptors are synthesized in the RPE. More than 260 genes in the RPE are responsible for the production of these peptide fragments. Mutations in any of these genes as well as ischemic, physical or chemical RPE damage causes retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration may be inherited, such as in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Stargardt's disease, choroideremia, Best vitelliform dystrophy and Bietti's crystalline dystrophy. Retinal degeneration may also be acquired through genetic mechanisms, such as age-releated macular degeneration. In retinal degeneration, there is a developing loss of RPE and photoreceptors, regardless of the underlying cause.\n\nUmbilical cord Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) have significant paracrine and immunomodulatory properties. WJ-MSCs secrete trophic factors that stimulate RPE or secrete trophic factors that are similar to those produced by RPE. In studies using animal models, WJ-MSCs have been found to be effective in stopping the progression of retinal degeneration and for rescuing photoreceptors in the dormant phase. WJ-MSCs are hypoimmunogenic and have significant immunomodulatory properties. WJ-MSCs have been shown to suppress chronic inflammation and prevent apoptosis in animal models of neurodegenerative and ischemic retinal disorders. WJ-MSCs also stimulate progenitor cells in the retina and elicit self-repair mechanisms.\n\nThe aim of this preliminary clinical study is to investigate the ef\ufb01cacy of deep sub-tenon injected WJ-MSCs as a stem cell treatment modality for the management of retinitis pigmentosa, which creates outer retinal degeneration. These functional and structural effects were investigated using microperimetry, electrophysiology and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective clinical study that utilizes a large number of RP cases, and cases that are in phase-3."

                              "This phase I, multisite, pilot study will test whether infusions of human cord tissue derived MSCs (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\n\nThe study population will consist of six patients 18 to <21 years old with a life expectancy \u2265 72 hours and COVID-19 related MIS-C that is refractory to treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly recognized, serious, hyper-inflammatory syndrome that is occurring in small numbers of children, many of whom are within a month or so of recovering from a COVID-19 infection. While the clinical presentation varies, affected patients are typically previously healthy individuals who are less than 21 years of age. The diagnostic criteria include fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and multisystem involvement requiring hospitalization. Up to 75% of patients present with an element of cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, with some also requiring intubation with mechanical ventilation. Reported supportive treatments have included intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and aspirin. In the limited cases reported, up to 50% of children with MIS-C have antibodies to COVID-19 in their blood and may or may not be PCR positive on a nasal swab or throat culture. The disease is incompletely understood but currently believed, at least in part, to be a hyper-immune response to a recent COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, MSCs have been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and decrease production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, up to 70% of infused cells are engulfed by lung macrophages, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules by these macrophages. These observations have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may work through both anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and regenerative mechanisms.\n\nOver the past several months, MSCs have been tested in small cohorts of adult patients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to determine if the cytokine storm hypothesized to cause this complication could be suppressed by MSCs. Early results are encouraging, and formal clinical trials are underway. Extending this work into the pediatric population, the hypothesis of this study is that infusion of hCT-MSC can reverse the pro-inflammatory state in children with MIS-C.\n\nThis is a 6 patient, multisite, pilot study to test whether infusions of hCT-MSC are safe in pediatric patients with MIS-C. Information will also be gathered about the duration and severity of the participant's multisystem inflammatory syndrome. hCT-MSCs will be manufactured at Duke University Medical Center in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and shipped frozen to the treatment site, where they will remain stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until the day of dosing.\n\nThe baseline evaluation will include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate), echocardiogram, ECG or telemetry strip, HLA typing, Panel Reactive Antibody (anti-HLA antibody), inflammatory markers, blood counts, blood chemistry, coagulation, and COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests.Patients will be dosed with 2x10^6 hCT-MSCs/kg. Doses will be given on days 1, 2, 3, and a fourth, optional dose may be given on day 7 at the discretion of the investigator and the treating physician. Prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Hydrocortisone, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes via a syringe pump. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluids will be managed by the care team. Afterwards, the participant will continue to be monitored in their care setting per institutional standards. Participants will be evaluated by study staff the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications.\n\nThe participant will be monitored by study staff to assess for any infusion related adverse reactions or complications until discharge. Additional follow-up will occur on days 14, 28, and 90. Follow up testing will include assessment for adverse events as well as the tests done at baseline (with the exception of HLA typing and COVID PCR."

                              "Spinal cord injury (SCI), damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves, often causes permanent neurofunction deficit, including strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of injury. WHO reported 15-40/million people suffer from SCI each year, about 250,000 to 500,000 people. The majority of SCI victims are young patients, who are at the time of working age. As a result of that, SCI not only affects the physical and psychological health of those patients, but also bring huge economic burden to their families, as well as the society. The current treatments for SCI mainly include surgical operation, neuroregenerative medicine, physical therapy, chinese acupuncture and so on. However, none of these methods are efficient enough to make any functional recovery of neurological injury in patients, and most patients will have to face paraplegia or tetraplegia.\n\nThe most challenge of SCI treatment are reported to be regeneration of axon and rewiring of the damaged spinal cord. The properties of strong proliferation and differentiation make stem cell transplantation possible to replace the damage axon and rebridge the injury spinal cord. Currently, evidences from animal experiments and pilot clinical studies have reported that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation was a potential method to treat spinal cord injury, but its safety and efficacy remain controversial.\n\nThis study will conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of different phrases of SCI, including sub-acute, early stage, and late stage of chronic SCI. These three trials will investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal transplantation of UC-MSC in patients with SCI treatment. The study will be conducted at 3 hospitals in China, covering eastern, southern and western of Chinese mainland.\n\nThe primary outcome is the changes of motor and sensory assessment before and after intervention using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Score Scale. Secondary outcomes will include International Association of Neural Restoration Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIRFS), electromyogram test, residual urine test and adverse events.\n\nThe enrolled participants will be followed up at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation. Besides, the samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected, before and after treatment, to explore the potential mechanism of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of SCI.\n\nThe results of this study will, for the first time, provide high level of evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

There will be a baseline visit before MSC therapy is initiated, and there will be a follow up visits every 4 months for 1 year after the final MSC infusion. These infusions will take place in between pamidronate infusions (i.e. 2 months after the last pamidronate infusion, and 2 months before the next one). Pamidronate aids in treatment of bone pain and bone mineral density but does not correct the underlying defect nor does it show substantial improvements in linear growth.\n\nAfter the MSC infusions, patients will be provided an overnight at Ronald McDonald House, or a hospital affiliated hotel so they can be near to the hospital in case of any unanticipated effects, and for a follow up visit the next morning.\n\nLabs will be collected during every visit to look at bone metabolism. Limb and bone age x-rays, pQCT scans, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will be completed annually, while spine films will be completed every 18 months. These images will directly examine bone health. Body measurements will be taken every visit as well to assess linear growth. The patients' parents will complete events diaries and submit them each infusion day to evaluate fractures that occurred between visits. Patients and their parents will also complete quality of life surveys once a year.\n\nThere will be financial compensation for each study visit. Subjects will also be provided a free lunch on days when radiology visits occur and will be reimbursed for parking.\n\nSubjects will be identified and recruited mainly through Children's endocrinology clinic. There will also be advertisements to the OI foundation, and neighboring pediatric hospitals with OI programs such as University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt. If identified as eligible to participate, the study team will seek approval by the subjects' primary endocrinologist. The consent process will then take place in person during a baseline visit.\n\nThere is an optional part of the study that involves donation of a bone fragment that is taken out during a routine surgical rodding procedure. This piece of bone is removed and discarded, if it is not donated, making it minimal risk. Bone sample donation will be available to OI Type 3 subjects receiving MSCs, and to OI Type 3 subjects who are not receiving MSCs but want to participate in research.\n\nLeftover blood samples, and bone fragments may be stored for future research by the sponsor of this study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to help doctors and scientists learn if serial MSC infusions will safely and effectively aid in growth, bone health, and ultimately improve motoric function and quality of life in this population."

The dose-escalation methods with a modified continual reassessment at the five dose levels (1x10^6, 10x10^6, 20x10^6, 40x10^6, 80x10^6, cells/kg) will be performed to determine safety and feasibility of allogeneic BM-MSC infusion during pediatric cardiac surgery and the maximum tolerated dose in infants with CHD. In addition to the primary objective of assessing the safety and feasibility of BM-MSC delivery through CPB, our secondary objectives are designed to develop biological signature measures and clinical outcome measures feasible for use in larger efficacy and effectiveness trials with a particular focus on neurodevelopmental outcome and early postoperative course after BM-MSC treatment. We will determine actual magnitude of differences in neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental variables and postoperative inflammatory and pathophysiological variables after BM-MSC delivery in infants with CHD. Enrollment, follow-up, and analysis are planned to occur over 36 months for the treatment and initial follow-up portions of the study.

                              "Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19), caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which occurs as a growing pandemic in early 2020 and currently represents an emergency state worldwide. Several reports have shown that the first step in the pathogenesis of Sars-Cov-2 is the recognition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor by the virus. This ACE2 receptor is widely distributed on the surface of human cells, especially as type II alveolar cells and capillary endothelium, however bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen are known as immune cells, such as T and lymphocytes. B and macrophages, are negatives to ACE2. These results suggest that immunotherapy can be used to treat infected patients. However, an immunomodulatory capacity cannot be so strong, if just one or two major immunological factors used, as the virus can cause a \"cytokine storm\", such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10 , MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\u03b1, followed by edema, gas exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury and secondary infection that can lead to death. Therefore, avoiding a \"cytokine storm\" may be the key to treating patients infected with Sars-Cov-2. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for immunomodulatory activity, can have beneficial effects in preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm. Because MSCs have been widely used in cell therapy, from basic research to clinical trials. Safety and efficacy have been clearly documented in several clinical trials, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). The objective of the study is to verify the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with SARS-CoV-2."

                              "To date, there is no effective therapy to cure multiple sclerosis (MS). Immunomodulatory therapies are useful in reducing the frequency of inflammatory processes (relapses) but don't delay significantly the progression of the disease, prevent long term disability or induce the repair of damaged tissue. This proposal contemplates the use of adult autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat patients with active MS. This is a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial in which 8 patients with active forms of MS and moderate disability will enter the trial with the primary objective of assessing the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of BM-MSC. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by gadolinium enhancing lesions though magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological effects and immunological effects. Once randomized, patients will undergo BM extraction and once confirmed the availability of the needed dose, they will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms (BM-MSC named XCEL-MC-ALPHA, or placebo). XCEL-MC-ALPHA will be cryopreserved for all patients regardless the allocated arm. At month 6, the treatment will be crossed. Patients will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years."

                              "Septic shock is one of the most common and devastating health problems in the intensive care unit, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% and a staggering economic burden of approximately 4 billion dollars annually in Canada. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders, hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy in this vulnerable population."

                              "Since December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\nHuman and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the \"New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)\", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases. Early research in this laboratory used UC-MSCs to intervene in endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice, and confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect mouse lung tissue from endotoxin-induced damage.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This trial will recruit 48 patients. 24 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (4 times) of 5.0*10E6 cells/kg of UC-MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 24 patients received conventional treatment were used as control group. The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days to 96 weeks follow up."

As a result of that, SCI not only affects the physical and psychological health of those patients, but also bring huge economic burden to their families, as well as the society.

Besides, the samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected, before and after treatment, to explore the potential mechanism of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of SCI.\n\nThe results of this study will, for the first time, provide high level of evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

                              "Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has spread quickly from Wuhan China to worldwide. On 15 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1.914.916 confirmed cases and 123.010 deaths globally, being a severe threat to public health.\n\nSome patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure. Several reports demonstrated that COVID-19 specifically recognized the angiotensin I converting ezyme 2 repector (ACE2) and ACE2-positive cells are infected by the virus. ACE2 receptor is widely present on the human cells surface such as alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelium, among others. COVID-19 infects cells and stimulates a terrible cytokine storm in the lung followed by edema, dysfunction of the air exchange and acute respiratory distress which may lead to death. Further, once COVID-19 enters in blood circulation, it can easy spread to some systems and organs, causing significant damage. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to believe that the inhibition of inflammatory response is the key to treat COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. Some studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 virus, reducing proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells into the lungs.\n\nThese immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the Phase I/II, double-blind (neither the participant nor the investigator will know if active drug or placebo is assigned), placebo-controlled, randomized (assigned by chance), in which subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia shall be received either MSCs (1 million cells/kg) or placebo by intravenous injection. The administration of cells will be done only once."

For the patients who have suffered from ischemic stroke in 3 months, indeed, they have the opportunity to get symptomatic improvement through receiving conventional stroke treatments that including rehabilitation. At the same time, these treatments are ineffective in some cases. Alternatively, the phenomenon of increasing brain plasticity after stroke provoke an essential therapy. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment enhances a functional improvement after cerebral ischemia, likewise, treament in rodent models are proved effective. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells therapy performs a role as take the place destroyed cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. The totality of evidence from trials running umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplanted into patients suffering from ischemic stroke support the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, positive results are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nOur research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of safety and efficacy in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 2 parallel groups)."

                              "Background: Cranial bone defects are often left following brain surgery, usually to allow swelling of the brain to recover before subsequently re-implanting a protective covering of the brain at a later time (cranioplasty). These procedures are performed anywhere over the cranial vault, either unilaterally or bilaterally. The original piece of bone (autologous bone plate = bone flap) is placed in a sterile container and stored in a refrigerator at temperature of -40oC.\n\nWeeks or months later, when the brain is relaxed, the scalp well healed and the patient's medical condition permits, the individual is taken back to the operating room and the bone is reimplanted (A procedure known as an autologous cranioplasty). The aim of the procedure is to restore cosmesis and protection to the underlying brain and it can sometimes also improve neurological symptoms by unknown mechanisms. Unfortunately these aims are not always achieved and whilst technically straightforward the procedure is known to be associated with a number of complications. Two of the most significant of these are infection (such that the bone flap needs to be removed and replaced) and resorption (such that the protective function is compromised). Overall 10% of autologous bone patients become infected, 10% require replacement due to resorption and 12% become significantly resorbed, then in 32% of case the autologous bone has failed.\n\nIn each case of cranioplasty failure the patient requires readmission, a second operation to remove the bone flap, prolonged antibiotic therapy (in the case of infection), and then a new custom-made plate and readmission for a third surgical procedure.\n\nIn most cases synthetic materials such as polymethylmethacrylate and titanium mesh are used for reconstruction. Commonly reconstruction is carried out by the surgeon using such materials to sculpt the cranioplasty. More recently, hydro formed titanium plates have been used. This entails a process of CT scanning the defect, virtual reconstruction, 3D printing of moulds, pressing the plate and hand finishing. Whilst highly successful in treating more than 150 patients, the titanium cranioplasty remains in the patient for life and, as a non-biological material, presents as a preferential site for infection (approximately 5% of cases). In addition, medical CT images for assessment and treatment of neurological conditions are compromised for life due to metal artefacts arising from the plates. Furthermore, interference with metal scanning equipment commonly used for security purposes also remains a life time issue. The patients with an infected titanium cranioplasty require a fourth admission to remove the metal or polymer plate, extended antibiotic treatment and then a fifth surgical procedure to reinsert a new cranioplasty.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC): MSC are multipotent adult cells capable of differentiating down multiple mesenchymal lineages. They are adherent fibroblastoid-like cells with an extensive capacity for expansion. They reside within the connective tissue of most organs and have been isolated from bone marrow, placenta, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, amniotic fluid, circulating blood, various foetal tissues, skeletal muscle synovia, dental pulp, liver, spleen, lung and dermis. Most work has focussed on MSC derived from bone marrow, however, there are also some clinical reports using adipose tissue and placental derived MSC. MSC from different sources may not be functionally equivalent or exhibit the same differentiation potential. The main functions for bone marrow derived MSC with regards to the present study is the ability to differentiate down the osteogenic lineage. It is this ability to differentiate that has seen them applied to bony non-union and the treatment of critical size bone skeletal deficits, and in particular the reconstruction of cranial voids. In the current proposal Cell and Tissue Therapies W.A. at Royal Perth Hospital have extensive experience and have applied for an TGA (Therapeutics Goods Administration, the Australian Government regulatory authority) licence to manufacture and provide MSC for patient treatment.\n\nMSC are not immunogenic and escape recognition by alloreactive T cells and NK cells. They have low level expression of HLA class I and no expression of HLA class II. They do not express co-stimulatory molecules and are unable to induce T cell mediated immune response, and therefore can be used as universal donor cells. Allogeneic cells have been widely used in clinical trials in both immune modulation and tissue repair. The advantage of using allogeneic cells is that donor age can be controlled. The literature indicates that MSC harvested from donors older than 40 years are inferior. Since many of the patients being treated with a cranioplasty are greater than 40 years of age, the use of allogeneic cells in this study is preferable. Clinical human trials and animal studies support the use of allogeneic cells.\n\nCranioplasty: The Department of Medical Engineering and Physics at Royal Perth Hospital is a world leader in providing custom made implants and has been supplying custom made titanium cranioplasties for fifteen years. The basic methodology which has been used to treat over 150 patients includes the reconstruction of the void using advanced software based on the patients CT scan. Once the void has been reconstructed a female mould is created to press the titanium plate. The plate is then hand finished and checked for fitment on a premade defect model.\n\nBioceramic: Resorbable bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite and beta tri-calcium phosphate have been used in the treatment of bony deficit for many years. For example, ChronOS (Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf) bone graft substitute is a fully synthetic and resorbable bone graft substitute consisting of beta-tricalcium phosphate with a compressive strength similar to that of cancellous bone. The interconnected porosity acts as an osteconductive matrix for the ingrowth of bone cells and blood vessels. Such materials are used for filling of bone defects after trauma, reconstruction or correction in non-load bearing indications and commonly these materials prescribe a method of perfusion of the granules in the operating room with the patient's own bone marrow. Resorption of the bioceramics has been shown to occur over a period of 6-18 months (Buser 1998).\n\nPolymer Scaffold: There are a myriad of polymer materials used for surgery including in the area of cranio-maxillofacial surgery. The most common polymer is poly(lactic acid). PLA such as 70:30 poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) are made from a amorphous biodegradable copolymer which will ultimately resorb in vivo. The bioceramics and polymer materials are approved by the TGA for this indication."

                              "Asthma affects one out of every 10 patients in the United States. Many of these patients have poor asthma symptom control. For example, patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma have ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite aggressive treatment with asthma medications. These patients are at increased risk for medication-related side effects and potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Novel therapies are critically needed for this population.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that reside in the bone marrow. MSCs are anti-inflammatory and also promote body tissue repair. This study will determine whether one form of MSCs called \"interferon gamma-primed MSCs or \u03b3MSCs\" are safe for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.\n\nPatients will receive a single intravenous infusion of \u03b3MSCs at either 2x10^6 cells/kg or 5x10^6 cells/kg. Up to 12 young adults will be enrolled. The total sample size will not exceed 24 participants.\n\nThe study will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (for patient activities) and at Emory University (for laboratory research activities). Participants will be identified from the asthma clinics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Participants will complete up to 12 visits over 1 year and will be compensated for their time and travel. At the completion of the study, any samples remaining after experimentation will be de-identified and made available for future research.\n\nWhile some study participants may receive no direct benefit from participating in this study, others may benefit from the close monitoring of their respiratory health, specialized asthma education, and general evaluation of their condition, including lung function tests. Some participants also achieve psychological benefit from participating in an important research study and from interaction with the study staff. It is also possible that the knowledge obtained from this study, such as identification of biomarkers, may assist in the creation of novel asthma therapies in the future."

                              "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established therapeutic modality for high risk hematological malignancies in adults and children. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality after HCT is graft versus host disease (GVHD), affecting up to 70% of patients even with current prophylaxis and directly accounting for approximately a third of regimen-related death. Currently, pharmacologic prophylaxis consists of a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate, a drug combination introduced around 40 years ago. Despite this regimen being recognized as the standard of care, it is only partially effective, increases the risk of infection and disease relapse and imparts drug-related, short- and long-term adverse effects. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potent immune modulatory activity which is markedly enhanced by exposure to interferon \u03b3. In murine models, interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) primed MSCs (\u03b3MSCs) potently suppress GVHD without untoward adverse effects suggesting this cell therapy may markedly reduce the regimen related toxicity of HCT; however \u03b3MSCs have never been infused into patients.\n\nThis protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that freshly expanded \u03b3MSCs can be reliably produced and safely infused into patients undergoing HCT as GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nThis is an investigator-initiated Phase I study using a rolling 6, dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual to the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined in adults. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for a future Phase II study to demonstrate efficacy and support a Phase III randomized trial.\n\nThe researchers plan to enroll a minimum of 4 and maximum of 45 subjects who are greater than 1 year old. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after the HCT. The study will be conducted at Emory University and will recruit participants from the Winship Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital in Atlanta at Egleston."

                              "Study Rationale Emphysema is one of the two main components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes over many years to airway obstruction by the loss of elastic recoil around the smallest airways. Emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking and it is widely accepted that the disease is caused by excessive proteolytic activity by proteases and a chronic inflammatory process, characterized by a cellular influx consisting of macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. This inflammatory response is steroid resistant and leads to slow but persistent alveolar destruction, resulting in enlarged lungs with bullous parts in both lungs. In addition to a central role of innate immunity, recent studies suggest that also (auto)antigen specific immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\nCurrently, the only treatment available for severe emphysema is lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to remove the most destroyed parts of the lungs. The surgery is generally performed in two separate sessions with a 10-12 weeks interval, with each lung as a separate surgical target. This surgical treatment allows improved ventilation in the remaining less affected areas of the lungs as demonstrated by post-surgical clinical improvement of lung function and increased survival in a subgroup of patients. Delayed wound healing after LVRS is an important clinical problem. It may lead to prolonged hospital stay due to air leakage from the lungs into the thoracic cavity. Lung emphysema patients are at high risk for prolonged air leakage after this surgery, which is most likely explained by the inflammatory process related to the disease.\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into several cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. In recent years it has become evident that bone-marrow derived MSC (BM-MSC) have potent immunomodulatory effects on T and B cells and in animal models of chronic inflammation in vivo. In addition, it has been shown that MSC express or release a variety of soluble factors implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling and cell growth. Importantly, encouraging results have recently been obtained with the treatment of severe steroid resistant Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) with donor (allogeneic) BM-MSC. Furthermore, in our institute autologous BM-MSC are currently under investigation for treatment of tissue injury due to autoimmune disease (Crohn's Disease) and allogeneic immune responses (renal transplant recipients with biopsy proven subclinical rejection). The combination of the immunosuppressive, growth-potentiating and anti-apoptotic properties of BM-MSC may lead to accelerated wound healing after LVRS and might induce lung repair. In the present phase I study the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous (i.v.) administration of BM-MSC prior to LVRS in a small group of severe pulmonary emphysema patients. Results of this safety and feasibility study may lead to future studies on the use of BM-MSC for immunomodulation and induction of repair in patients with pulmonary emphysema and milder stages of COPD.\n\nObjective To test the safety and feasibility of intravenous administration of autologous BM-MSC after one-sided LVRS and prior to a second LVRS procedure for patients with severe pulmonary emphysema.\n\nStudy design Open label, non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective clinical trial. Patients are operated in two sessions; initially on one lung without pre-surgical infusion of BM-MSC, followed by a second surgical procedure on the contralateral lung which is preceded by two i.v. infusions of BM-MSC one week apart, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the lung surgery.\n\nStudy population Patients of at least 40 years of age with end-stage emphysema who are eligible for lung volume reduction surgery.\n\nIntervention The intervention consists of two doses of BM-MSC infusions in 10 patients with a one week interval, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the second LVRS respectively.\n\nStudy endpoints\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n1. Safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of two doses of BM-MSC with 1 wk interval after the first LVRS and prior to a second LVRS. Toxicity criteria will be evaluated by grade according to WHO.\n\nSecondary endpoint:\n\nDifference in days between post-surgical transpleural air leak of the lung in each patient after the first (no infusion of BM-MSC) and second surgical (3 weeks after the last i.v. infusion of BM-MSC) intervention.\nHistological responses in resected lung tissue (measured by immunohistochemistry of markers of inflammation, fibrosis and repair)."

                              "The chronic kidney disease is caused by renal structural and functional impairment for more than 3 months due to various causes, including normal and abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), abnormal blood, urine, and imaging findings, or an unexplained decline in GFR (<60 ml/min). Recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease has increased year by year worldwide, the incidence of CKD is 8% to 16% in the world's total population. The incidence of CKD and the primary causative factors vary from country to country and region, and the idemiological survey led by Peking University Hospital shows that the prevalence of CKD in China is 10.8% , the primary causative factor is glomerulonephritis, but as the incidence of hypertension and diabetes rises year by year, and the world will have more than 10 million people a year have acute kidney injury, the proportion of chronic kidney disease in the long-term course of the above population will be much higher than the normal population, chronic kidney disease has become an important public health problem in China and even the world.\n\nSummarizing the basic and clinical studies at home and abroad, inflammatory factors such as inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species interact with fibrosis factors such as mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast activation, which are the root causes of the progression of CKD and the formation of tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis and developing into end-stage renal disease.\n\nCurrent treatments for chronic kidney disease are very limited, and to be precise, there is currently no cure for chronic kidney disease, nor is there a proven way to improve the kidneys survive after acute kidney injury (AKI). The progression of the disease itself can only be delayed as much as possible by changing the diet, controlling related complications with oral medications (such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy, etc.), and actively controlling blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes. For patients with stage CKD5 and more severe, renal replacement therapy is recommended, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, but there are many complications in both dialysis methods, such as narrowing of the internal fistula, occlusion, catheter infection, peritonitis, etc. The presence of the above complications will reduce the service life of the patient's dialysis pathway while also causing blows to other organ systems. Kidney transplantation may be considered when economic conditions permit and there is a matching kidney source, but kidney transplant surgery is riskier, and the average survival of transplanted kidneys is currently 12 years calculated by the American National Kidney Foundation, during this period, patients need to take anti-rejection drugs uninterruptedly, and these drugs (such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.) can also greatly damage the kidney organs and function. The above treatment methods have brought a heavy burden to patients and social medicine. In order to seek innovative and effective strategies to cultivate the limited regenerative capacity of the kidneys and reverse renal fibrosis, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with tissue regenerative potential and immunomodulatory functions have brought new ideas and hopes for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease.\n\nProgression in chronic kidney disease includes tubular interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis:\n\n1) Tubular interstitial fibrosis is mainly characterized by tubular hypermetabolism, tubular epithelial-interstitial transition, and hypoxic damage to the renal interstitium, which eventually leads to infiltration of inflammatory cells, abnormal increase in extracellular matrix components in renal tissue, and disappearance of parenchymal cells. 2)Glomerulosclerosis is the outcome of excessive response of glomerular constituent related cells to injury, including structural changes, cells' gradual atrophy, shedding, apoptosis of cells, loss of anticoagulant properties, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pro-fibrosis factors; Proliferation of mesangial cells, mesangial differentiation into myofibroblasts, causing collagen III to be deposited in the renal units, leading to irreversible hardening of the glomeruli; The number of pinus process cells decreases, the skeleton retracts or flattens, and inflammatory cell aggregation of chemokines is released, while synthetic cytokines and growth factors further aggravate globules capillary sclerosis.\n\nBoth pathophysiological abnormalities are characterized by parenchymal cell loss and activation of the inflammatory immune response. However, due to the weak regenerative capacity of renal tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells, foot process cells even lack regenerative ability, these renal parenchymal cells are difficult to repair themselves once damaged, and the kidney lacks stem/progenitor cells, which cannot achieve stem/progenitor cell differentiation and regeneration. Therefore, after severe kidney damage, the existing treatment methods cannot promote the complete repair of the kidneys, often resulting in the delay of kidney disease, which is also the main reason why chronic kidney disease has become the highest incidence of chronic disease in humans.\n\nMSCs are only briefly present in the renal vascular system, and Togel F, Hu Z et al. found that their presence was not detected within the renal parenchyma after 3 days of MSC infusion, and in general, stem cells were only briefly present in the blood vessels of the kidneys and could not colonize for long periods of time7. Studies such as Camila Eleuterio Rodrigues found that gene expression in the kidneys of MSC-treated rats showed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in several growth factors with pro-mitosis, pro-survival, and anti-apoptosis effects8. There is a large body of research evidence that MSCs modulate the immune response primarily through paracrine/endocrine nutritional growth factors and ultimately promote renal repair.1)Stem cells secrete immunomodulatory correlates;2) Stem cell secretion promotes renal vascular formation and tubular cell regeneration related factors;3)MSC may also reduce renal fibrosis and structural remodeling through immunomodulation;4)Stem cell secretion improves matrix metabolism-related factors.\n\nmesenchymal stem cell therapy has a good safety record, there is no obvious toxic side effects for patients, a small number of patients have injection of local discomfort, transient low-grade fever, etc., generally do not need special treatment, patients will recover naturally, long-term observation has not found that patients have increased microbial infections and the carcinogenicity of Mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nCharacteristics and advantages of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs isolated from umbilical cord tissue, not only maintain the biological characteristics of MSCs, but also have the following advantages compared to other tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells: 1) Convenient materials, which is waste utilization. 2) The process is less invasive to the donor than the extraction of bone marrow MSCs. 3) The isolated cell content and proliferation ability are better than bone marrow MSCs, and the immunogenicity is lower than that of bone marrow MSCs, which is not easy to trigger the immune response or cause graft-versus-host disease. 4) The differentiation potential is stronger, and differentiation can be carried out in multiple directions. 5) Stronger ability to secrete cytokines and may have a stronger paracrine (exosome) repair effect. 6) Compared with bone marrow MSCs, the results of gene lineage comparison show that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells can express more genes and proteins related to matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, which is more suitable in the field of nephropathy treatment.\n\nTherefore, in the field of nephropathy treatment, umbilical cord MSC has greater potential for application.\n\nThis study was a prospective, single center, randomized controlled and double-blind study, total duration 36 months, of which each patient study cycle is 13 months, and long-term safety follow-up is 12 months after the end of the study. It is grouped by the random number table method, divided into the experimental group and the control group according to the ratio of 1:1, 22 people were required in the experimental group and 22 people in the control group, for a total of 44 people. Experimental group will receive UC-MSC, while the control group will receive saline solution. The expected effect is UC-MSC can delay the progression of renal function in patients with brady nephropathy,reduced or alleviated chronic kidney disease-related complications (e.g., anemia, hypertension)."

                              "Aging frailty is a clinical syndrome, characterized by a decrease of homeostatic reserves and enhanced vulnerability to endogenous or exogenous stressors, exposing individuals to an increased risk of adverse health-related outcomes. The human umbilical cord (HUC) is a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), compared to embryonic stem cells, HUC-MSCs are noncontroversial with a painless collection procedure and faster self-renewal properties. HUC-MSCs can differentiate into the different germ layers and modulate immune responses. One possible mechanism for the onset and development of aging frailty is the depletion of stem cells. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against aging frailty.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 30) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The HUC-MSCs Group (n = 15) will receive intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells twice over a month (30 days interval), the Control Group (n = 15) will receive the same protocolized intervention with normal saline. Follow-up duration is 6 months after first intervention. The reported serious adverse events\uff08SAEs\uff09will be observed within one month post infusion. The short-item from health survey\uff08SF-36), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Fried phenotype scale will be evaluated. Short physical performance battery (SPPB) and plasm biomarkers will be assessed.The assessments will be performed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore domains of efficacy of HUC-MSCs through the reduction of signs and symptoms of aging frailty and to evaluate the safety of HUC-MSCs in subjects with aging frailty."

Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated to actively suppress the immune system and hereby evade recognition.\n\nThis knowledge will be transferred into studies in the ischemic reperfusion-injury/primary lung graft dysfunction in lung transplantation, and in suppressing the initial host immunological response towards the transplanted lung where a high degree of immunological and inflammatory activity is involved.\n\nWe will conduct a clinical trial in which patients receiving lung transplantation will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue. The aim is to assess the impact of MSCs on primary graft dysfunction.\n\nThe perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be a paradigm shift for the clinical problems seen in the first period after lung transplantation and reduce the long-term graft rejection and dysfunction."

The investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation. The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae, Astellas Pharma), and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will receive basiliximab (Simulect\u00ae, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.\n\nUp to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30 days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a 2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90 days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.\n\nThe study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials."

                              "Liver transplantation is the only lifesaving intervention for patients with end-stage liver diseases. The current immunosuppressive agents reduce the incidence of acute cellular rejection; however, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term side effects of these regimens now has become a major challenge for liver transplant recipients and is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need, for example, increases in the incidence of bacterial, viral infections, nephrotoxicity with chronic renal impairment, de novo diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurotoxicity, hematological toxicity.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Current clinical trails demonstrated that the use of autologous bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) for renal transplanted patients resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function. Compared with BM-MSC, umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) may be the better choice for clinical application. One main reason is that the collection of BM-MSC from liver transplanted patients would be harmful for the patients. Moreover, the proliferative abilities of BM-MSC from patients with liver disease are deficient, whereas, UC-MSC can be obtained from discarded umbilical cords and can be produced on a larger scale. Our and other studies reported that the infusion of human UC-MSC are feasible and can improve liver function of liver fibrosis and liver failure.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the conditions in liver transplanted patients. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in liver transplanted patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus UC-MSC treatment. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus placebo. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After UC-MSC transfusion, patients are followed up at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and the evaluation of liver function recovery was performed."

                              "A randomized, multicenter, single-blinded phase III trial will be conducted to assess whether the intracoronary infusion of umbilical cord WJ-MSCs demonstrates a superior effect in reducing HF incidence following AMIs compared to standard treatment.\n\nThe sample size was determined with a 5% error, 80% power, a one-year HF incidence rate of 1.3-4%, and division between two groups in a 2:1 ratio (control:intervention), and a three-year follow-up period.\n\nA total of 360 patients with a history of an anterior ST-elevation MI (STEMI) successfully reperfused within standard golden time within 3-7 days after AMI will be enrolled.\n\nRandomization will be done via permuted block randomization through a web-based service. A block size of 4 will be considered. Two groups of equal proportion will be formed, where only one will receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs besides the conventional therapy provided to both groups. Those who assess the study outcomes will remain unaware of the allocation (single-blind).\n\nThis study will use cGMP-certified clinical-grade human WJ-MSCs (Cell Tech Pharmed Co. Ltd., Tehran, Iran).In the intervention group, all 120 patients will receive a single intracoronary infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs alongside the conventional treatment that will be provided to the same number of patients in the control group. Patients in the intervention group will be taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where the infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs will be done through the intracoronary route.\n\nBefore statistical analysis, adjudication of all measurements will be done by an experienced cardiology department member excluded from the research group. The adjudicator will assess the quality of each measurement and will exclude those with inadequate quality from the analysis, where they will be regarded as missing. An independent, blinded safety committee will evaluate potential major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Once the adjudication process is complete, the finalized database will be unblinded.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group. Treatment efficacy will be assessed according to the decrement in HF with the help of Cox regression analysis. The investigators will consider the EF to have improved significantly if a minimum increment of 3% is achieved after six months. The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat approach. The baseline characteristics of the two study groups will also be compared. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation, while frequencies and percentages will be given for categorical data. The EF, as the primary outcome, will be compared between the study groups using the independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The therapeutic effect will be estimated with a 95% CI. Two-sided P-values will be used. Safety will be compared between the two groups according to the occurrence of MACEs (death, recurrent AMI, ICD insertion, non-target vessel revascularization, etc.) and serious adverse events (SAEs). These events will be followed over time with Kaplan-Meier curves, which will allow us to understand their patterns. With the help of the Cox proportional hazards model, The investigators will assess the statistical significance and 95% CI.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group.

The DSMB will have the authority to stop the trial early if patient safety is compromised or if the primary research objective is met. All safety issues (unanticipated SAEs, mortality, intracoronary infusion complications, and severe arrhythmias, etc.) will be monitored by the DSMB, and the DSMB statistician will report the occurrence of safety issues in each study group quarterly. All deaths will be reported.\n\nThe investigators have discussed all ethical issues with the Institutional Review Board of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, which ultimately approved the study protocol (IR.SUMS.REC.1400.409). Informed consent will be obtained once patients are clinically stable and sedatives or strong analgesics do not alter their consciousness. Importantly, the use of low balloon inflation pressure and divided (three-part) infusions will prevent complications related to intracoronary cell infusion. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki will be upheld throughout this study."

                              "There are about 1.7 billion people with different types of chronic liver diseases in the world, of which about 240 million are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and about 15%-40% of chronic hepatitis B can develop into liver cirrhosis and die of liver hardness every year There are hundreds of thousands of patients. There are about 90 million hepatitis B carriers in China, including about 20 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Every year, about 2%-5% of compensated cirrhosis patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis patients. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate of decompensated liver cirrhosis is only 14-35%, and the quality of life and prognosis of patients are poor. From the progression of liver fibrosis to the decompensation of liver cirrhosis, liver failure often occurs. Statistics show that slow increase The 28-day mortality rate of patients with acute liver failure of grade 1, 2 and 3 is as high as 22%, 32% and 77%. The 90-day mortality rate was 41%, 73%, 95%. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the most effective means to treat decompensated liver failure due to liver cirrhosis, However, the shortage of donor liver, immune rejection and high cost have become treatment obstacles. Application of artificial liver support system for blood flow Plasma replacement can remove toxic substances from blood, but it can't supplement albumin and coagulation factors, and it is important to whether reducing the mortality rate is still controversial. Therefore, it reverses or delays the process of liver cirrhosis and reduces the compensatory stage of liver cirrhosis It is an important link in the treatment of liver diseases that the patients develop into decompensated stage The curative effect of medical treatment on hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory period) is very limited; Liver transplantation is difficult to popularize in clinical application due to the lack of donors and high cost. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are derived from mesoderm in early development, is a high degree of self-renewal ability, Pluripotent stem cells with high proliferation ability and multidirectional differentiation potential widely exist in bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, and other tissues. They can be cultured and expanded in vitro, and can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, cartilage tissues, nerve cells, hepatocytes and so on under the control of specific conditions, which has great application value in cell therapy and tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of hepatitis B cirrhosis (compensatory stage). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group, with 10 cases in each group, a total of 20 cases. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, namely, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells injected through peripheral vein group and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with stem cells based on conventional medical treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of patients were observed in detail within 24 weeks after treatment, and the long-term effect of stem cell therapy was observed after 96 weeks of treatment."

However, ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBLs) are still one of the most serious complications after OLT, with a usual reported incidence of 5-15%, and an incidence of up to 26% in some studies. 46% patients with ITBLs require re-transplantation after 2 years of OLT.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),a kind of pluripotent stem cells,can differentiate into vascular endothelial cells, which participate in angiogenesis in ischemic tissue. MSCs can also stimulate the proliferation and migration of mature endothelial cells via paracrine.Furthermore, MSCs secret a variety of cytokines and growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, human basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-1 and interleukin-8, etc., which also induce angiogenesis.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 6 months of standard regular treatment for ITBLs plus huc-MSCs treatment.\nArm B: Participants will receive 6 months of standard regular treatment for ITBLs plus placebo.\n\nhuc-MSCs will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant.

                              "Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Since 25 years, patients with moderate to severe emphysema are treated with inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Currently, consensus is developing that this anti-inflammatory treatment is not effective to halt progression of emphysema. Therefore, emphysema may be classified as steroid-resistant and requires new anti-inflammatory treatment approaches, including cellbased therapies. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response in various diseases, including steroid-resistant transplant rejection, Crohn's disease and possibly emphysema as indicated by our pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .\n\nObjective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from healthy donors.\n\nStudy design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30 patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and 11 before the second LVRS.\n\nStudy population: patients between age 45 and 65; a gradient of emphysema severity towards the lung apex as assessed by CT-derived lung densitometry and equally distributed between left and right lung; FEV1 between 20% and 45% pred; Gas diffusion capacity between 30% and 45% pred. Intervention (if applicable): MSC infusions with cryo-preserved MSC in a dose of 2 x 106 /kg body weight in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg ( at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) in a covered bag or NaCl 0.9% with 5% DMSO in a covered bag, both produced in the GMP facility of LUMC.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2 or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: LVRS is a routine procedure for treatment of emphysema and received a positive recommendation from the Cochrane Institute. The dose of MSC has been infused in over 200 patients in LUMC only causing mild side effects like fever and headache, mostly related to DMSO, which is present as a cryoprotectant in the verum. Placebo may also cause fever and headache (DMSO). For the study, additional physical exams will be performed 6 monthly for a period of 3 years after LVRS2 and additional blood sampling specific for the study protocol will be 50ml in total. A heparinized blood sample of 10 ml per sample will be taken: 1) just before the 1st LVRS while patient is under general anaesthesia, 2) just before the 1st MSC iv, 3) just before the 2nd MSC iv, 4) just before the 2nd LVRS while the patient is under general anaesthesia. Discomfort for the patient caused by the experimental treatment will be minimal while there is no reason to assume that hospital admission for the surgery will be prolonged by the cell therapy or placebo. The risks associated with the investigational treatment are low as the reported adverse events in Toetsing Online from previous MSC studies in LUMC show only mild to moderate severity. The risk-benefit analysis is low."

It will not be allowed changes in psychiatric medication during this period. If a patient or the treating clinician decides that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians. The investigators defined refractory bipolar depression as depression that failed to respond to two trials (during lifetime) with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizer with proven efficacy in bipolar depression (lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) in adequate doses for at least 6 weeks or until cessation of treatment due to side effects (Schoeyen et al., 2015).\n\nAfter the initial injection, patients will continue maintenance treatment with their current psychiatrist. During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive treatment as usual per their clinician's choice. Patients will remain on stable psychiatric medications during this period. If patients need to change medications, they will be removed from the study protocol."

                              "Study Design and Setting The study was carried out at the Internal Medicine Intensive Care Unit (IMICU) and Anesthesiology and Reanimation Intensive Care Unit (ARICU) at Erciyes University Hospital which is a referral hospital in the Central Anatolia. The study was approved by the Erciyes University Ethics Board (2016/114; Date: 19.02.2016) and Ministry of Health of Turkey. Informed consent from surrogate decision-makers was taken for study participation after confirmation of eligibility criteria.\n\nPatients The study was planned as prospectively. During two years, 10 patients with sepsis and septic shock were included in the study from IMICU and ARICU. Sepsis and septic shock were diagnosed according to the sepsis guidelines [1]. Inclusion criteria for this study were; patients who were between 18-80 years of age and were hospitalized at IMICU and ARICU with the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock. Exclusion criteria were categorized that patients who were younger than 18-year-old and older than 80 years and were pregnant women or breast-feeding; patients who had terminal stage of cancer, advanced pulmonary disease receiving oxygen at home, advanced pulmonary hypertension (WHO Class III or IV), advanced heart failure (American Heart Association Class III or IV), severe liver disease (Child C), and history of anaphylaxis. Standard therapy of sepsis as suggested in the guidelines [1,2] were given to all patients and additionally MSCs treatment was applied to the patients in the study group. Control patients diagnosed sepsis and septic shock and having similar characteristics for the consideration of severity of disease based on APACHE II score and co-morbid diseases with study group were selected from IMICU and ARICU records retrospectively.\n\nPatients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded.\n\nSource and Application of MSCs MSCs were prepared in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Laboratory of Genome and Stem Cell Center at Erciyes University. Cell production and quality control assessment procedures were carried out according to GMP protocols authorized by the Ministry of Health of Turkey. Allogenic adipose derived MSCs (ADMSCs) which were obtained from a healthy donor were applied to all patients in the study group. Five doses of ADMSCs were applied to the patients at 1st and 3rd day (post-thawed of frozen MSCs cryo-bag), 5th-7th and 9th day (re-plated ADMSCs vials) of therapy. Each dose of ADMSCs was prepared as 1 x 106 ADMSCs/kg. The vials containing ADMSCs were mixed with gentle motions before the usage; thus, it ensured product homogenization. ADMSCs were infused intravenously via central venous line in a physiological saline solution by using a blood transfusion set. The patients were monitored during all these procedures.\n\nPreparation of ADMSCs Sufficient cryo-preserved ADMSCs vials were thawed to provide the required dose for administration. The frozen ADMSCs were thawed and cultured in the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% human serum, 1% Penicillin- Streptomycin solution, and 1% stable glutamine (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 incubator which described before [16]. Briefly, ADMSCs were recovered and resuspended in physiological saline solution and transferred to the patient with the temperature-controlled bag. The morphology of cell appearance and the viability were assessed beside the identification of phenotypic characteristics of the cells and microbiological tests. Immunophenotyping characterization of ADMSCs was performed by using flow cytometry analyses (Beckman Coulter, USA) with antibodies against CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD44 (BD Stem Flow hMSC kit).\n\nCytokine Analysis Ten ml peripheral venous blood samples were collected before each MSCs infusion at 1st, 3rd,5th, 7thand 9th day of therapy. The serum samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes and stored at - 80\u00b0C until laboratory analysis. Cytokine level was analyzed with ELISA method by using Human BioSource for (TNF-, IFN- \u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10) kits in Robonik Read Well Touch model (Robonik India Pvt Ltd) device.\n\nClinical and Laboratory Follow-up Clinical findings and laboratory results were recorded at the administration of MSCs infusions at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th days. Patients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded. The patients were monitored for unexpected adverse events. In the clinical follow-up of the patients APACHE II, SOFA (the sequential organ failure assessment score) score, clinical progression and outcome of patients were recorded. As laboratory following, inflammatory markers; C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cell (WBC), bleeding parameters (platelets, INR, fibrinogen), lactate, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), renal functions (creatinine) were also recorded. Laboratory test results were analyzed according to MSCs administration days. The differences of the laboratory tests were compared between the survivor and non-survivor patients according to MSCs therapy days.\n\nOutcomes of the patients were compared with the previous observational study conducted in the same Intensive Care Units (ICUs) as control. The day of death and 0-6th, 7-14th, and 15-28th days were determined as survival status and endpoint. In case of death, the date and cause of death were also recorded.\n\nStatistical Analysis In the study, the results were compared to controls. Statistical analysis was performed using Turcosa software. The relationships between categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square analysis. When parametric assumptions were provided in comparison of numerical variables in two groups, the Student-T test was used and the Mann Whitney U test was in the case that the parametric assumptions did not provide. For the analysis of repeated measurements; Paired Sample T-Test was used for binary comparisons and the Repeated Measures ANOVA test was used for comparison of more than two repeated measurements. The survival probability of the patients during the follow-up period was determined by Kaplan-Maier survival analysis. The effect of age and APACHE II to co-variants analysis were adjusted. p <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant."

The remaining 50% of patients have non-responding recoveries that leads to amputation of the compromised limbs. Currently, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in animal models or in small groups of patients with diabetic foot ulcer has shown to be safe and effective. Particularly, the use of these cells induce regeneration, both in the dermis and the epidermis. Nevertheless, MSC transplantation has some limitations, for instance, time restrictions in the availability of cells due to their isolation and expansion as well as the complex and costly large-scale production. In the same manner, the cryopreservation might cause deleterious effects that affect the biological activity of the cells and a medical professional should conduct the cell administration. In addition, different studies report variability in the results due to the inconsistency in the methods that they used (extraction protocols, cultivation, expansion and administration). The investigators' recent studies in mice with skin lesions, particularly type 1 diabetes, have shown that the presence of the cells is not necessary to promote skin regeneration and the administration of dac-MSCs is sufficient to stimulate would healing."

Fifteen adult patients with refractory, rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. If the participant is not currently diverted, then participants will undergo a laparoscopic diversion with a loop ileostomy. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The participants will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.\n\nParticipants will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified participants will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessed. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug. Participants will return on: Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104."

                              "Cerebral palsy refers to a neurological disorder caused by a non-progressive brain injury or malformation that occurs in early childhood. It can result in central motor deficits, developmental retardation, abnormal posture, abnormal muscular strength, abnormal muscle tone and/or dysreflexia. It has a high disability rate. There is currently no effective treatment for cerebral palsy. Conventional treatments for cerebral palsy are often tiresome and expensive and have a slow onset of action. Stem cells have been recently used in the treatment of cerebral palsy. This provides a novel method for the treatment of cerebral palsy. According to the existing clinical studies, neural stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are mainly used as the seed cells for the treatment of cerebral palsy. UC-MSCs are the most promising seed cells for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of the advantages including rich sources, ease of harvesting, short doubling time, low immunogenicity, long-time survival post-transplantation, and no ethical issues. UC-MSCs have been widely used to treat Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, traumatic brain injury, aplastic anemia, and decompensated liver disease. However,only two studies, and performed only in China, are reported on the treatment of cerebral palsy with UC-MSCs. One from the Hospital 463 of PLA reported 51 patients with cerebral palsy whose symptoms had not been obviously improved after 1 year of rehabilitative treatment. These patients received intrathecal injection of UC-MSCs for three times, once a week, followed by one injection of UC-MSCs via the peripheral vein in the fourth week. Four UC-MSCs injections, once per week, were considered as one course of treatment. Activities of daily living scale score was compared between before and after treatment to evaluate efficacy. Another study is a case report from China. In this report, a combined intravenous and intrathecal injection of UC-MSCs was used to treat cerebral palsy in a 5-year-old child. 28-month follow-up results revealed that the child's gross motor function, immune function, muscle strength, and language ability improved and adverse reactions were not obvious."

                              "General context:\n\nAs of March 13, 2020, more than 145,000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed with 5,500 deaths worldwide. As of March 21, 14,469 cases have been confirmed in France, of which 562 have been fatal while 1,525 patients are currently hospitalized in intensive care units. Whereas the pandemic continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients (Murthy et al., 2020) with a 30%-60% mortality rate. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 variation from baseline at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 40 patients, of whom 20 will be randomized to cell-treatment administered via intravenous route while the remaining 20 patients will be randomized to receive a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Patients will be followed up to 12 months after treatment.\n\nState of the art:\n\nMesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020), regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products.\n\nSo far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018) and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al., 2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010).\n\nOnce they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013) and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017).\n\nGiven the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 circulating levels and an increase in CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng et al., 2020)."

                              "Background:\n\nNephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare disease characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria and the need for steroid treatment. About 50% of children will become frequent relapsers (FRNS) or steroid dependent (SDNS), requiring higher doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for many years, sometimes up to adulthood. Strong evidence suggests that Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), at least in the steroid-sensitive forms, has an immune pathogenesis.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that produce an immunomodulatory activity in-vitro and in-vivo. For this reason, we postulated that SDNS patients could benefit with treatment with MSC.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe main goal of the present study is to assess whether CB-MSCs have the capacity to regulate the immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NS allowing for a reduction or suspension of chronic immunosuppressive treatment in SDNS children. The primary objective is to evaluate whether CB-MSC therapy is able to prevent NS recurrence for at least 6 months after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment in children with SDNS.\n\nPrimary endpoint: percentage of children without NS recurrence after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment for at least 6 months.\n\nPopulation:\n\nWe plan to enroll 11 children (3 to 18 years of age) with SDNS, maintained by chronic immunosuppressive treatment and with stable remission for at least two months.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nOpen label single-arm, monocentric trial, with a rescue/second design\n\nPhase: Phase II\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria:\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAge between 3 and 18 years;\nClinical diagnosis of SDNS;\n\nDisease remission maintained by chronic therapy (at least 6 months) with either:\n\nUse of a combination of 2 or more immunosuppressive drugs\nuse of 1 of the calcineurin inhibitors (Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus);\nAbsence of proteinuria (urinary protein:urinary creatinine < 0.2 mg/mg) for at least 1 month;\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate greater than or equal to 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;\nWritten informed consent from parents or guardians and the child when possible.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nAge < 3 years or \u2265 19 years;\nResistant/refractory NS;\nPresence of genetic mutations associated with NS;\neGFR less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;\nThrombophilic condition;\nPregnancy or lactating;\nEvidence of an uncooperative attitude;\nAny evidence that the patient will be unable to complete the trial follow-up.\n\nDescription of the Intervention:\n\nThe trial will rely on a single advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP), made by MSC from umbilical cord blood (CB) for allogeneic use, produced following a highly standardized process, developed and controlled at Cell Factory under the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines.\n\nAfter baseline clinical and laboratory evaluation, patients will receive 3 intravenous infusions of CB-MSCs at the dosage of 1.5 x 10^6/kg at a time interval of 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe immunosuppressive treatment will be gradually tapered off following the first CB-MSC administration: 25%, 50% and 100% reduction of the ongoing immunosuppressive treatment following the first, second and third administration, respectively.\n\nAt the end of this first part of the trial, a statistical analysis will be performed according to the primary end-point. In the case of failure to reach the primary end point an extra 11 children with SDNS will be enrolled in a single stage phase 2 study with a 30% incremented dose of CB-MSCs.\n\nStatistical Evaluation:\n\nA phase II design with a rescue plan B, is adopted to decide whether the proportion responding is less than or equal to 0.200 or greater than or equal to 0.600. A sample size of 10 children is required, considering a drop out of 10%, 11 children will be enrolled: if the number of responses is 5 or more, the hypothesis that P \u2264 0.200 is rejected with a target error rate of 5%. If the number of responses is 4 or less, the hypothesis that P \u2265 0.600 is rejected with a target error rate of 20% (power equal to 80%). The same statistical hypothesis will apply for the second part of the study.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe results of this proposal will provide information regarding an innovative cell therapy for the treatment of INS. If the hypothesis of this study is confirmed, it will be possible to reduce or withdraw immunosuppressive treatment in this vulnerable population of children with SDNS, reducing the need for ambulatory visits and hospitalization and therapy-related complications. Furthermore, the reduction in the use of immunosuppressive agents as well as in the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions will reduce the financial burden to the National Health Service. Above all, the quality of life of children with SDNS would clearly be improved, in terms of a reduction in long-term therapy, morbidity and the number of visits."

                              "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes. It is a persistent and refractory disease. There is currently a lack of effective clinical treatments for DN. The basic pathological processes of DN are renal tissue cell damage, apoptosis and continuous increase of inflammatory cytokines induced by early high glucose, which gradually leads to glomerular sclerosis and renal fibrosis.\n\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), as the \"youngest\" adult stem cells, have powerful anti-inflammatory functions, stronger differentiation potential, and good safety. They are ideal seed cells for the treatment of DN. At present, studies on a variety of animal models of DN have shown that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can delay the progression of DN and have a certain repair effect on damaged kidney tissue and renal function. Our previous preclinical study showed that UC-MSCs effectively improved the renal function, inhibited inflammation and fibrosis, and prevented its progression in a rat model of diabetes-induced chronic renal injury. Some autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been carried out abroad treatment of chronic kidney disease caused by various reasons, including clinical trials of DN, phase I/II test results did not show obvious adverse reactions related to stem cell therapy, and can improve the patient's renal function and quality of life to a certain extent.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating DN patients. This trial will recruit 38 patients. 19 patients received the treatment of conventional treatment + equal volume normal saline containing 1% human albumin (placebo group) were used as control group; conventional treatment + 1*10E6 UC-MSCs/kg body weight (experimental group) for intravenous infusion (once a week, 3 times in total) to treat 19 patients with DN (by unified standard inclusion), and subjects will be followed a total of 48 weeks from time of initial cell treatment."

The patients will undergo lipoaspiration under sterile conditions of the operating theatre, the collected lipoaspirates will be further processed - enzymatically with the use of collagenase or mechanically using the Lipogems system. After collection, lipoaspirates will be immediately transferred to the laboratory of the Department of Regenerative Medicine with a tissue and cells bank in Warsaw, and the preparations will be administered to the patients' knee joints in the operating room under ultrasound control.\n\nThe Lipogems system is defined as a minimal tissue manipulation system. In contrast, the administration of preparations produced using an enzymatic method requires advanced actions.\n\nLipoaspiration will be performed using blind cannulas and vacuum syringes introduced through the abdominal wall with a three-millimetre incision on the skin after previous injection to the adipose tissue with modified Klein's solution (500 ml of saline solution, 1 ml of adrenaline, 40 ml of 2% lignocaine), which makes the collection easier. 10 ml of the collected adipose tissue will be used to examine the samples after previous gradient drainage from Klein's solution. Immediately after collection, the samples will be sent to the laboratory for analysis (cell count testing, culture, phenotype identification, analysis by flow cytometry).\n\nThe patients will be monitored in the hospital outpatient clinic for one year after the procedure; the control visits will take place: after 2 and 6 weeks, then after 3 and 6 months and after a year. A physical examination and the assessment using the KOOS questionnaire will be performed. Before the procedure and after one year, an X-ray and MRI with T-2 Mapping will be carried out in order to evaluate the condition of the cartilage."

                              "Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious complications and the main cause of death in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Type III, type IV and type V LN are severe clinical entities with poor prognosis, and its treatment remains challenging. Currently, type III, type IV, type V, type III plus V and type IV plus V LN are treated mainly according to the guidelines developed by KDIGO and the European Association for Anti-Rheumatism and European League Against Rheumatism/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERAEDTA). The main therapeutic regimens recommended by these guidelines include glucocorticoid combined with immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide (CTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), etc. These medications can significantly induce disease remission and improve the long-term survival. However, some patients do not adequately response to the treatment of the combination of steroids and immunosuppressants, and the disease activity cannot be well-controlled. The high prevalence of steroids and immunosuppressants related adverse effects, such as steroid-related diabetes, bone necrosis, hypertension, peptic ulcer, CTX-related bone marrow and gonadal suppression, MMF-related infection risk and so on, have been found in long-term follow-up study. In addition, to date, there is insufficient data to support the use of new biologics, such as rituximab and abatacept in the induction therapy in patients with LN.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be obtained from several tissues and possess multiple differentiation potencies and immunomodulatory effects. The investigators have investigated the usefulness, and confirmed the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment of LN in animal models, in vitro experiments and phase I clinical trial. The studies also for the first time found that the MSC abnormalities are involved in the onset and development of lupus both in the lupus mice model and in SLE patients. The investigators found that the efficacy of allogeneic (xenogeneic) MSC transplantation is superior to autologous MSC transplantation in LN mice model. Thus, in current opinion, SLE is not only a hematopoietic stem cell disease, but also a mesenchymal stem cell disease. The investigators treated the refractory LN patients with allogenic MSC treatment, the outcomes revealed that the total response rate was 60%, the mortality rate of 2 to 5 years decreased from 35% - 45% to 6%. These results strongly support the use of allogenic MSC transplantation in the refractory LN patients. The mechanisms of MSC treatment include correcting the immune unbalance, inducing immune tolerance, tissue repair and the improvement of organ function. Allogeneic MSC transplantation for the treatment of SLE and other refractory autoimmune diseases have shown significant efficacy and excellent safety. However, these studies have limitations due to the lack of large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective study to further confirm the efficacy of allogeneic MSC transplantation, as well as the guideline for MSC treatment in SLE needs to be developed. Therefore, a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority, prospective, multicenter clinical trial is urgent needed to promote the application of MSC transplantation in SLE treatment, to bring the benefit of the patients with SLE."

The result of a survey of 5 regions in Southeast Asia showed that 39-72% of patients with DPN had severe or very severe impact on their quality of life. For the treatment of DPN, conventional drug therapy can almost only target a single pathogenesis and cannot treat it fundamentally. Therefore, new safe and effective treatment options for DPN are particularly important.\n\nBoth here and abroad, large number of experimental studies have shown that Bone Marrow or Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells have a significant therapeutic effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In 2012, the Department of Endocrinology of Wuhan Central Hospital took the lead in conducting a clinical study of Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells in the treatment of DPN in China. The results of the study showed that the nerve conduction velocity of the lower extremities in most patients was improved within 3 months after treatment compared with before treatment. No serious adverse events occurred during the period. Based on this research of our own. The clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of refractory diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality standards (QS) to explore the possible mechanism of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of DPN.\n\nThe investigators will do a Single center, randomization, open trial, controlled clinical trials design to assess treatment with the MSCs compared with the control group. 42 patients with DPN will be recruited in China. 21 patients receive i. m.

                              "Viral pneumonia is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by respiratory viruses. It is mainly caused by the invasion of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and adenovirus into the lower respiratory tract. Every winter and spring is the epidemic season. Influenza virus and adenovirus have high infectivity and pathogenicity. The rapid progress of some patients may be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction And died of complications. The fatality rate of severe patients is 9.8% - 60%. Most of the dead cases were the elderly and the patients with basic diseases. In addition to the complications, the main cause of death is ARDS caused by virus infection, on the other hand, the basic immune function of the elderly is poor, so it is difficult to form an effective antiviral response in response to virus infection. The direct destruction of the alveolar epithelial barrier and the systemic inflammatory response induced by the infection, namely, the destruction of the alveolar capillary barrier by the inflammatory waterfall, are the important pathogenesis of ARDS. How to effectively regulate the inflammatory response, prevent the inflammatory exudation and edema of the lungs, improve oxygenation, and reduce organ damage; at the same time, how to effectively improve the basic immune function and enhance the anti-virus immune response of such patients, has become the key to the success of the treatment of patients with severe viral pneumonia.\n\nUmbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) can differentiate into the different germ layers and play an important role in immune regulation and damage repair regulation. Clinical trials have shown that MSC is safe and effective in the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, and it can improve the immune function of patients with viral infectious diseases. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against severe viral pneumonia.\n\nThis is a randomized, singlecenter, open lable, intervention controlled clinical trial. The participants (n = 40) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The routine treatment group (n = 20) will receive the treatment according to \"Influenza diagnosis and treatment plan (2019 version)\", the HUC-MSCs adjuvant Group (n = 20) will receive intravenous infusion of definitive HUC-MSCs (1\u00d710^6 cells/Kg \u00d7 body weight(kg), which was selected by immunomodulatory assay through coculture with BV2 cell) on the basis of the routine treatment once at day 1 after joining. Follow-up duration is 90 days. The difference of 90 day mortality and average length of stay between the two groups will be observed and recorded. The changes of inflammatory index, viral load, oxygenation index and pulmonary imaging will be monitored at different time points after treatment in the two groups. The serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) will be observed during the period.\n\nThe intent of this study is to explore the efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of severe viral pneumonia through improving the antiviral immune response of patients, reduce the lung inflammatory damage caused by the virus and the pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the injury, and finally achieve the goal of reducing the mortality and improving the prognosis of severe patients, and to evaluate the safety."

Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of scanner used at baseline. Scans will be analyzed centrally. The 'baseline MRI scan' will be the reference for brain volume changes.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nDescriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed. Proportion of adverse events at each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution. The frequency, severity, timing and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize the safety of the intervention.\n\nThe probability of overall event-free survival (as well as progression-free, relapse-free, or MRI event-free survival) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated. The end point of progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater than 0.5 from baseline. Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with Wald-type 90% CIs based on Greenwood's formula for SE.\n\nDescriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using descriptive statistics. Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this efficacy measurement scales (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion.\n\nThe percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of those who have not met the end point by month 12.\n\nOther primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value minus the baseline value. The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from baseline measurement in the values at the month 1, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits was significantly different from zero,with baseline measurement defined as the screening assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other end points.\n\nTo calculate MSFC, results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint. The z scores that compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database."

The umbilical cord is one of the important sources of MSC. Human UC-MSC compared with the bone marrow-derived MSC has the following advantages: (1) the umbilical cord, as a \"waste\" after giving birth can be obtained without any harm to the donor. (2) easy available, and no ethical issues. (3) its likelihood of contamination is small because of the protection of the placental barrier. (4) human UC-MSC has a stronger amplification capacity, a shorter doubling time, a higher colony forming efficiency and lower immunogenicity. (5) which avoids the activity and differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSC latent with the donor disadvantage of increasing age decreased.\n\nhuman UC-MSC not only for hematopoietic stem cell graft implantation and amplification has a role in promoting and exhibit immunomodulatory effects and characteristics of damaged or targeted sites of chronic inflammation. human UC-MSC in the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced organ transplantation immune tolerance and other fields has broad application prospects.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of exploration, the investigators and other practitioners caught studies found that the umbilical cord is more suitable as mesenchymal stem cells seed cells relative to the bone marrow, umbilical cord easily obtained, no ethical issues, better amplification ability in vitro, viral contamination risk is small, and many other advantages. Therefore, over the years, the investigator team for the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in a lot of the basic work has been confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells derived from the umbilical cord had safety and effectiveness in in the treatment of acute graft versus host disease in zoology test, and successfully establish a perfect umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in standard operating procedures (including screening umbilical cord, large-scale preparation, quality inspection, preservation, recovery, transportation, infusion, etc.). The investigators will carry out the clinical research based on above preliminary results."

                              "Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of liver transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm, which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.\n\nIn recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees. However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, muliticenter, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240 decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group."

COVID-19 is characterized by sustained cytokines production and hyper-inflammation, can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness with a fatality rate around 2-5%. There are currently no prophylactic vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment agents available recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19.\n\nDuring the last decade, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial is needed to assess efficacy and safety.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs (4.0*10E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 30 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group.\n\nChange in lesion proportion (%) of full lung volume from baseline to day 10, day28 and 90, change in consolidation/ ground-glass lesion proportion (%) of full lung volume from baseline to day 10, 28 and 90, time to clinical improvement in 28 days, mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale, 6-minute walk test, maximum vital capacity (VCmax), Diffusing Capacity (DLCO), oxygen saturation, oxygenation index, duration of oxygen therapy, side effects, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days follow up."

                              "Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of liver transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm, which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.\n\nIn recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees. However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\nThe investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240 decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs (6.0\u00d710E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control group."

                              "Background:The most common problem following a kidney transplant is the development of acute or chronic rejection. Rejection is the immunologic reaction in which the body refuses to accept the transplanted organ. The body's immune system will make destructive antibodies that will attempt to attack the transplanted organ.\n\nIn order to prevent organ rejection, all patients receiving an allograft (a graft transplanted between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species) must take anti-rejection (immunosuppressive) therapy. These medications function by lowering the body's natural immune system. Often these medications are associated with significant side effects ranging from infections to cancer.\n\nStudy:\n\nThis is a single center, open label, dose-escalation clinical trial in 6 adult recipients of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)- non-identical, living-donor renal allografts. All participants will receive induction therapy with alemtuzumab followed by maintenance therapy with sirolimus and belatacept.\n\nA total of 3 dosing cohorts of 2 recipients each will receive 12 infusions of donor-derived MSCs starting on Day 42 post-transplant and every 4 weeks starting on Day 56 post-transplant, with a minimum of 7 days between the first and second MSC infusions.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine whether immune reconstitution after lymphocyte depletion in the setting of co-stimulatory blockade and systemic MSC-derived donor antigen can promote operational tolerance in recipients of kidney allografts.\n\nParticipants will be evaluated for eligibility for sirolimus withdrawal any time between week 52 and week 104 post-transplant. Participants who successfully complete sirolimus withdrawal will remain on belatacept monotherapy for at least 24 weeks before being assessed for eligibility to discontinue belatacept. Participants who successfully complete Immunosuppression Withdrawal (ISW) will then undergo 24 weeks of high frequency follow up followed by 132 weeks of standard follow up.\n\nStudy participation may continue for up to seven (7) years after kidney transplant surgery.\n\n*** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed, controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider."

                              "This is a 50 patient, Phase 1/2a multi-center pilot study to test the safety and to describe the preliminary efficacy of intravenous administration of allogenic human cord tissue mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT- MSC) as an investigational agent, under U.S. INDs 19968 (Duke) and 19937 (U Miami) to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection (COVID-ARDS). Patients will be eligible for treatment with 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC at 1 million cells/kg (max dose 100 million cells) in the phase 1 portion of the study or a fixed dose of 100 million cells daily x 3 days, 12-36 hours apart in the phase 2 portion of the study, if they have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS. The primary endpoint is short-term safety of hCT-MSC infusions given on this schedule. The key secondary endpoints are 28 day survival, an increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio by 50% at 96 hours, days to hospital discharge to home or rehab, and number of days requiring mechanical or non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula.\n\nThe study will be executed in two phases. The first 10 consecutive patients will all receive investigational product. The second part of the study is a randomized, controlled trial in 40 additional patients. The overall aim of the study is to establish safety and to gain critical information as to whether patients with COVID-ARDS will benefit from MSC infusions. Results from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the medical literature. Results from the additional 40 patients will be analyzed as a randomized placebo control trial. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study.\n\nThe MSCs are manufactured from allogeneic cord tissue donated to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank (CCBB) at Duke University. The CCBB is an FDA licensed public cord blood bank (licensed name DUCORD). Cord tissue is donated by mothers delivering healthy term male babies by Cesarean section, after written informed consent from the newborn infant's mother. Full donor screening and testing is performed in accordance with regulatory requirements (21CFR 1271). The hCT-MSCs will be manufactured in the Marcus Center for Cellular Cures in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing Laboratory and the Clinical Research Cell Manufacturing Program (CRCMP) laboratory, Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute (ISCI), Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami. These hCT-MSCs are already being utilized in clinical trials to treat pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder (IND 17313), cerebral palsy (IND 17921), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (IND 17313) and adults with osteoarthritis of the knee (IND18414). To date, over 210 doses of cells have been delivered to patients on these clinical trials with an excellent safety profile. At University of Miami, hCT-MSCs are used in the clinical trial to evaluate cytokine suppression in patients with chronic inflammation due to metabolic syndrome (IND 17324), 12 subjects in the pilot phase of the study had completed the dose without any treatment emergence SAE.\n\nThe rationale for using this approach for patients infected with COVID-19 is that ARDS, the rate-limiting complication impacting survival, is caused, at least in part, by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which results is severe immune dysregulation. Involved cytokines include IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, THP-1M, TNF-alpha, and others. MSCs have strong anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities without apparent toxicity or further immunosuppression. Approximately 3-5 % of patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS which carries a very high mortality rate (30-60%) due to multi-system organ failure. Effective treatment of ARDS, the most feared complication of COVID-19, may convert the COVID-19 pandemic into a more manageable \"flu-like\" illness that every American is expected to experience, and most will survive, on an annual basis."

                              "The general aim of the project is to develop a treatment for severe hoarseness due to vocal fold (VF) scarring. Vocal fold scarring can be caused by tumor surgery, radiotherapy, severe inflammation or is early acquired (sulcus vocalis with scar) and results in stiff vocal folds with decreased vibratory capacity and severe deterioration or total loss of voice (aphonia). There is no lasting effective treatment. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are immunomodulatory, decrease inflammation and improve endogenous healing. After receiving ethical permission the investigators have since 2012 treated 16 patients with manifest vocal fold scarring and severe hoarseness by scar resection and local injection of autologous bone marrow MSC to restore speech. This project was the first in the world to study the effects of MSC treatment of vocal fold scarring in humans. Analysis was made before and up to 12 months post operatively with voice recordings, examination with high speed camera and elasticity measurements of the vocal folds with novel technology. No side effects were found for any patient and for two thirds of the patients with 12 months follow-up the vocal fold function improved and no patient deteriorated.\n\nWhile cell therapy with autologous MSC was classified according to the Tissue Legislation before 2015, it is now regarded as drug treatment. In accordance with this legislation, the MSC production is now full scale GMP. The investigators have recently received permissions from Swedish Medical Product Agency (DNr 5.1-2019-92069) and from the Regional ethic committee (Drn 2019-06160) for an open Phase I/Il study in patients with severe dysphonia and vocal fold scarring to evaluate safety, tolerability and vocal function after surgery with local administration of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell product KI-MSC-PL-204 as an extended study on 15 patients.\n\nMSC may in the future be used to treat patients with severe hoarseness due to scarring, as well as other damages in the airways."

At this stage of the disease, perhaps a multi-faceted approach to halt the toxicity of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and promote cell survival and/or replace lost cells would be most beneficial.Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical drug which can improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are being clinically explored as a new therapeutic for treating a variety of immune-mediated diseases.Preclinical studies of the mechanism of action suggest that the therapeutic effects afforded by MSC transplantation are short-lived and related to dynamic, paracrine interactions between MSCs and host cells.Clinical trials of MSCs thus far have shown no adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous MSC transplants. Clinical studies showed that umbilical cord derived MSC is immunologically stable and not toxic.\n\nThis study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC (Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell).This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease."

Patients with only one submandibular gland will be ineligible.\n\nAll participants will be called by a study coordinator 3 days (+/- 2 days) after injection to assess pain and will have a phone visit with a physician 1 week (+/- 2 days) after injection during which the investigator will assess pain and ask about the area of injection regarding redness and/or swelling. All participants will complete a pain diary with daily entries over the first month to record the occurrence and severity of pain using a 0-10 visual analog scale and occurrence and severity of other adverse events (e.g., redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness, rash, pruritis, nausea, vomiting, fatigue). Participants will also keep a log of all pain medications taken including both narcotic and non-narcotic medications (e.g. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc.) for the first month. Participants will complete 5 follow-up visits over the course of 24 months - at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following the intervention. Salivary collection for analysis as well as QoL surveys will be obtained at these visits.\n\nDose Reduction:\n\nIf dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 1 participant (n=6 participants, staggered at least 14 days), Dose Level 0 will be recommended as starting dose for subsequent trial.\nIf DLT in greater than 1 participant, dose level -1 will be administered, staggered at least 14 days in n=6 participants.\nIf DLT in this cohort is in less than or equal to 1 participant, Dose Level -1 will be recommended as starting dose for subsequent trial. If DLT in greater than or equal to 2 participants, study will be stopped.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo evaluate the safety and tolerability of MSCs for subjects with xerostomia after radiation therapy for HNC.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of MSCs for treatment of xerostomia and salivary hypofunction via quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires, salivary amount, and salivary compositional analysis.\nTo assess the imaging characteristics in HNC patients after MSC injection using ultrasound.\nTo assess the feasibility of a future Phase 1 dose-escalation study."

                              "Allergic rhinitis (AR), is a noninfectious inflammatory disease of nasal mucosa mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody and involved in a variety of immune active cells and cytokines after the atopic body is exposed to allergens. The incidence of allergic rhinitis increases as people's living standards improves. It is estimated that about 1.4 billion people worldwide have been affected by the disease. Some patients with moderate to severe AR have no improvement in symptoms after drug treatment, which continues to affect daily life and work. Therefore, these patients urgently needs a new, minimally invasive, effective and simple treatment. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the mesoderm, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat and other cells. MSCs can also secrete a variety of bioactive molecules, which have the effects of regulating immunity and anti-inflammatory. Based on its immunomodulatory effect, MSCs is gradually becoming a new star in the treatment of allergic diseases. In pre-clinical studies on the treatment of AR, MSCs have shown good therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThis study is a prospective, open, single-center clinical study. Participants were recruited into three different dose groups. The cohort size of each dose group was 6 participants. The subjects of each group each will receive one course of treatment with a single injection. Subjects of group 1 will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 2 will receive 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg; with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 3 will receive 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs. One month after each injection, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will comprehensively evaluate the results of the phased clinical research, and after determining the safety and feasibility of the research, the enrollment of the next phase will start. The subjects will be followed up on the 3rd day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the treatment. The main outcome measures are the severity and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcome measures are RQLQ score, VAS score, serum inflammatory factor detection, nasal secretion inflammatory factor detection, nasal function test and nasal endoscopy, etc. In addition, the investigators will also monitor safety indicators such as blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, immunological indicators, tumor markers, etc. At the end of the study, according to the data obtained, the clinical safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of UCMSCs in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent AR will be evaluated, so as to provide drug dose basis for the next stage of clinical research."

This study will enroll patients that have persistent symptomatic perianal disease despite being treated with an MSC coated fistula plug, and also treat patients that have had recurrence of their perianal fistula.\n\nAs per the previously approval treatment under IND 15356, patients will have a single affected fistula treated, which is the same fistula that was treated in the original protocol. The matrix for delivering the cells is a Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug.\n\nSubjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified subjects will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessment will be made if an EUA is clinically necessary to assess the fistula. As this is a re-treatment trial, patients with incomplete response to initial plug placement typically have close follow up, recent MRI imaging, and may have a seton in place. If an EUA is clinically indicated, this would be by a colorectal surgeon for drainage of sepsis and placement of a seton as part of the standard clinical care for perianal fistula.\n\nPatients will return on: Day 1, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24."

                              "Liver cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands and causes by many forms of liver diseases and conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. Liver cirrhosis has become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality with over one million people died due to cirrhosis in 2010 worldwide. Currently, the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. However, the shortage in donor organ availability and the side-effect associated with long-term immunosuppression after transplant requires the development of new alternative therapies for liver cirrhosis. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) as well as umbilical cord-derive mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. In Vietnam, however, there are no clinical trials to date that investigate the potential of UC-MSCs for liver cirrhosis management. This is a phase I, open label, single arm trial using UC-MSCs to treat patients with liver cirrhosis that includes 20 patients. The primary outcome measure will be change in MELD score at 3, 6, and 12 months after UC-MSC transplantation from baseline. The safety is assessed by frequency and severity of the adverse event or serious adverse event associated with stem cell injection. This study could reconfirm the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis and would open a novel cell therapy for the treatment of adult liver cirrhosis"

This situation has put health systems under extreme pressure, being overwhelmed be the amount of patients requiring attention.\n\nAround 5% of patients will require ICU internation, due to severe lung inflammation giving rise to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a cytokine storm that ultimately affects other organs. In this group, mortality can be as high as 40%.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have shown great immunomodulatory effects, and are used in other inflammatory conditions as autoimmune diseases, being safe and preliminary effective in improving patients health status. They exert their effect via paracrine and autocrine pathways and have been shown to reduce IL-1, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor alpha and increase IL-10 in COVID 19 patients. One of the greater advantages of the MSC is that they express no Major Histocompatibility Complex, reducing the risk of host immune reaction.\n\nGiven their immunomodulatory effects, research in this topic showing their safety and experimental efficacy are needed, as therapies for severe patients are lacking. Patients, researchers and data analysts will be blinded, and ARDS patients will be randomly allocated in standard therapy plus MSC arm or standard therapy alone to answer these questions."

Acute GVHD is defined as the presence of skin rash and/or persistent nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea and/or cholestasis presenting in a context in which aGVHD is likely to occur and where other etiologies such as drug rash, enteric infection, or hepatotoxic syndromes are unlikely or have been ruled out.\nParticipant has failed to respond to steroid treatment, with failure to respond defined as any Grade B-D [International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) grading] aGVHD that shows progression within 3 days, or no improvement within 7 days of consecutive treatment with 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent.\nParticipant must be able to be treated with remestemcel-L within 4 days of signing of informed consent.\n\nParticipants who have had persistent GI GVHD manifested by diarrhea with stool volume < 500 mL/kg/day (for participants >50 kg) or <30 mL/kg/day (for participants \u226450 kg). See GVHD Organ Severity Criteria (Table 2) for values in mL/m^2. In the absence of nausea or vomiting, participants could have been considered to have Grade B GVHD if:\n\nother causes of diarrhea had been ruled out (eg, Clostridium difficile, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection, or oral magnesium administration), and if\nthe low stool volume reflected the effects of fasting, narcotics, or antidiarrheal medications.\n\nParticipant must have adequate renal function as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min per 1.73 m^2. For participants 1 to 18 years of age, creatinine clearance is calculated using the Bedside Schwartz equation:\n\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR, in mL/min per 1.73 m^2) = (0.413 * height [cm])/serum creatinine (mg/dL)\n\nFor participants younger than 1 year of age, renal function is determined using the Schwartz equation adjusted for this age group:\n\nCreatinine clearance (mL/min per 1.73 m^2= (height [cm] x 0.45)/ (serum creatinine [mg/dL]).\n\nParticipant has a minimum Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Level of at least 30 at the time of study entry.\nParticipant (or legal representative where appropriate) must be capable of providing written informed consent.\nFemale participants of childbearing potential (\u226510 years of age) are required to use a medically accepted method of contraception and to agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for the follow-up time period. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method.\nMale participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method or abstinence) during the study, including the follow-up time period.\nThe participant must be willing and able to comply with study requirements, remain at the clinic, and return to the clinic for the follow-up evaluation during the study period, as specified in this protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipant has Grade B aGvHD with skin-only involvement.\nParticipant has received any second line therapy to treat aGVHD prior to screening.\nParticipant has received systemic agents other than steroids and prophylactic agents for primary treatment of aGVHD.\nParticipant shows evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or other active pulmonary disease, which is likely to require more than 2L of oxygen via face mask, or an estimated fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) of 28% via other delivery methods in order to sustain an O2 saturation of 92%.\nParticipant has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the participant including but not limited to uncontrolled infection, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.\nParticipant has received any stem cell agents (other than hematopoietic graft) during study participation or within 30 days prior to study entry. Previous use of irradiated granulocytes within 30 days is permitted.\nParticipant has received an HSCT transplant for a solid tumor disease.\nParticipant has had prior treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including remestemcel-L.\nParticipant shows evidence of severe (required treatment) hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction at screening.\nParticipant had positive laboratory test results indicating infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at any time and/or active hepatitis B or C virus infection within 3 months prior to screening.\nParticipant shows evidence of encephalopathy, as defined by a change in mental status since the onset of aGVHD.\nParticipant is a female who is pregnant, lactating, or is planning a pregnancy during study participation, or in the follow-up period.\nParticipant currently being treated for a solid tumor malignancy.\nParticipant has participated in any interventional clinical trial for an aGVHD therapeutic agent. However, in exceptional cases, experimental agents may have been administered to enrolled participants at the Investigator's discretion.\nParticipant has participated or is currently participating in any autologous and allogeneic stem cell or gene therapy study for the treatment of aGVHD. Participants participating in investigative protocols aimed at modification of the transplant graft (such as T-cell depletion) or aimed at modification of the conditioning regimen are allowed in the study.\nParticipant has a known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or to murine, porcine, or bovine proteins."

                              "Liver cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by the formation and accumulation of an extracellular matrix, which leads to the progressive distortion of the hepatic architecture. In China, the most important cause of liver cirrhosis is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver cirrhosis usually progresses irreversibly into advanced stage, such as a decompensated stage which is characterized by a series of clinical manifestations, including ascites, variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy with high mortality. Liver transplantation is the only option that can improve the survival of these decompensated liver cirrhosis patients; however, this procedure is associated with several limitations, such as the severe shortage of donor livers, long waiting lists, multiple complications, and high cost. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nAnimal models have shown that bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) can ameliorate liver fibrosis and reverse fulminant hepatic failure. In clinical, autologous BM-MSC have significantly improved liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. A recent research also found that autologous BM-MSC therapy safely improved histological fibrosis and liver function in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Allogeneic MSC therapy, such as umbilical cord-derived MSC (UC-MSC), have shown to be safe and beneficial for the patients with liver cirrhosis caused by autoimmune diseases. Our previous studies showed that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients and increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients. However, the single-center clinical study, the relative small size of the patient cohorts, absence of evaluation on long-term efficacy prevent firm conclusions being made with regard to the safety and efficacy of this treatment in liver diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how UC-MSC can improve the liver function, and the incidence of serious complications in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a multi-center clinical study."

                              "This prospective, open-label clinical phase-3 study was conducted at Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology between April 2019 and April 2021. Thirty-six eyes of 18 patients with toxic optic neuropathy were included in the study. The primary toxic optic neuropathy (TON) diagnosis was made in emergency or intensive care clinics. Patients who admitted within 3 months after the first intervention were included in the study. All patients enrolled underwent a complete routine ophthalmic examination, including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement with the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart (Topcon CC 100 XP, Japan). The patients were further evaluated with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) from RTVue XR (Avanti, Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) to analyse and measure the changes in the ganglion cell complex (GCC) layer that provided a typical co-registered en-face and cross-sectional multimodal imaging platform. Functional evaluation of optic nerve was followed by Compass 24/2 visual field (VF) test (Compass, CenterVue, Padova, Italy) and 120' pattern visual evoked potential (pVEP) test (Mon 2018F, Metrovision, Perenchies, France).\n\nSubjects Thirty-six eyes of 18 TON patients were included in the study.\n\nInclusion criteria consisted of several parameters:\n\nCases poisoned with a toxic agent within 3 months\nPatients with BCVA better than 35 letters\nAny degree of visual field loss\nPatients over 18 years old\n\nExclusion criteria consisted of several parameters:\n\nCases poisoned with a toxic agent more than 3 months\nPatients with BCVA less than 35 letters: to perform the visual field test correctly\nNeurological sequelae that cannot be cooperated\nSmoking\n\nThe same treatment protocol was applied to all patients with methanol intoxication before admission to our clinic. Hemodialysis, bicarbonate and ethanol were administered to all patients. The cases were divided into 3 groups according to similar demographic characteristics.\n\nGroup 1: Consists of 12 eyes of 12 patients treated with WJ-MSC and rEMS combination in one eye. WJ-MSC was applied only one time before rEMS applications. rEMS application was started 10 days after WJ-MSC application.The rEMS was applied with a custom-designed helmet for 30 minutes after the WJ-MSC application. rEMS applications were repeated 10 times with a 1-week interval. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.\n\nGroup 2: Consists of 12 eyes of 12 patients treated with only rEMS in one eye. The rEMS was applied with a custom-designed helmet for 30 minutes. rEMS applications were repeated 10 times with a 1-week interval. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.\n\nGroup 3: Consists of 12 eyes of 6 patients treated with only WJ-MSC in two eyes. WJ-MSC was applied only one time for both eyes. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.\n\nUmbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells preparation The mesenchymal stem cells used in this study were isolated from Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord that was collected allogenicly from a single donor with the mother's consent. The umbilical cord sample was treated following several steps. Briefly, cord tissue was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Lonza, Switzerland) and the Wharton's jelly part was minced using forceps and a scalpel. Minced pieces were cultivated in a cell culture dish (Greiner Bio-One, Germany) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (DMEM)-low glucose with no L-glutamine (Bilogical Industries, Israel) and 10% human AB serum (Capricorn, Germany), 1% 10.000 U/mL penicillin, and 10.000 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Gibco,USA). All cell preparations and cultivation procedures were conducted in a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) accredited laboratory (Onkim Stem Cell Technologies, Turkey). The culture-expanded cells were cryopreserved at P3 using standard cryopreservation protocols until used in the following experiment. CryoSure-DEX40 (WAK-Chemie Medical, Germany) containing 55% Dimethyl Sulfoxide and 5% Dextran 40 was used as cryopreservant. The cells were characterized at the time of cryopreservation using flow cytometric analysis to determine the expression of the positive cluster of differentiation (CD) surface markers, CD90, CD105, CD73, CD44, CD29, and negative for CD34, CD45, and CD11b. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the expressions of several genes, such as tumor necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) and vimentin (VIM) were analyzed. Additionally, quality control analyses, such as mycoplasma and endotoxin analyses (using the PCR and LAL test combined with sterility analysis, respectively) were also completed. Cells were solubilized from cryopreservation before being prepared for injection. Average cell viability for each treatment was over 90.0%, and each patient received 2-6 x 106 cells in a 1.5 ml saline solution.\n\nInjection of umbilical cord WJ-MSCs The WJ-MSCs suspension from the culture was delivered to the operating room by cold chain and used within 24 hours. A total of 1.5 ml of the WJ-MSC suspension was immediately injected into the subtenon space of each eye. The procedure was conducted under topical anesthesia with proparacaine hydrochloride drops (Alcaine, Alcon, USA) and sterile conditions. 5/0 atraumatic traction suture was applied to the limbus for easy access and manuplation to application area. Postoperatively, loteprednol and tobramycin combination eye drops were given four times per day for one week, and oral amoxicillin clavulonate (1 gr) was given twice a day for five days\n\nRetinal repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rEMS) The rEMS helmet (MagnovisionTM, Bioretina Biotechnology, Ankara, Turkey) stimulated the retina and visual pathways with an electromagnetic field strength of 2000 miligauss, frequency of 42 hertz, and duration 30 minutes. These values were previously determined to be effective for other clinical and preclinical studies.\n\nTimeframe\n\nThe patients were evaluated at several study timepoints:\n\nT0 (baseline): immediately before the applications\nT1: 1rst month of applications\nT2: 3rd month of applications\n\nPrimary outcome measure \u2022 ETDRS visual acuity: The visual acuity scores obtained from the T0 and T2 examinations were analyzed and compared using statistical tests to determine effectiveness.\n\nSecondary outcome measures\n\n\u2022 Visual field sensitivity: Fundus perimetry deviation index (FPDI, %) FPDI was examined in the 24/2 visual field of the computerized perimetry records. The FPDI offers data explaining how many of the 100 flashing points and what percentage of the visual field could be correctly seen by the patient. For VF analysis, in order to avoid mistakes during the test, practice rounds were carried out three times before applications.\n\n\u2022 Ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC thickness, \u00b5m): GCC is the thickness from the internal limiting membrane to the inner plexiform layer in the 3x3 mm of foveal area. The measurement done automatically by the OCTA device. GCC is the total thickness of the ganglion cells and retinal nerve fibers.\n\n\u2022 Pattern visual evoked potential (pVEP) pVEP is a objective test that measures the electrical activity of the optical pathway in response to a light stimulus. The 120' patterns reveals responses from the all retinal quadrants. The measurements were taken according to the ISCEV standarts for both eyes. We used the 120'pattern VEP protocol, which combines p100 implicit time and amplitude, to create a numerical result."

                              "Since late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic, more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48 patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other 24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment."

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only drug approved specifically for the treatment of PBC. However, one out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and many need additional medical therapy or liver transplantation, or both.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into biliary epithelial cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in PBC patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus UDCA. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus UDCA. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 4,8,12,24,36 and 48. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase(ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time(PT), albumin(ALB), prealbumin(PA), are detected at these time points. Mayo risk score, portal hypertension, Liver histology, MELD score and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously."

                              "Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty. Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July 2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies"

However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems. Since current therapeutic options for LF that is usually with extremely poor prognosis are still limited, recent studies indicate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their function in immune modulation and liver-damage repair, are of great therapeutic potential for this disease. Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) replace hepatocytes in injured liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration.The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and initial efficacy of human umbilical cord MSC (UC-MSCs) treatment for patients with LF. In this study, MSCs were isolated from umbilical cord and generated in appropriate growth medium. 50 LF patients with LF received i.v. transfusion of 0.5-1.0\u00d7106 cells/kg of MSCs as the treated group and other 20 LF patients with LF were transfused with placebo without MSCs as control group. All 70 of them received the routine management for liver failure. During the 2-year follow up, the evaluation of safty and efficacy will be undergone to help to establish innovative cell-based therapies for the treatment of diseases."

                              "Since its introduction into clinical trials, cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloro-platinum) has had a major impact in cancer medicine, changing the course of therapeutic management of several tumors, such as those of ovary, testes, and the head and neck. Unfortunately, in addition to causing bone marrow suppression, ototoxicity, and anaphylaxis, dose-dependent and cumulative nephrotoxicity is the major toxicity of this compound, sometimes requiring a reduction in dose or discontinuation of treatment. Approximately 25-35% of patients develop evidence of nephrotoxicity following an initial dose (50-100 mg/m2) of cisplatin, due to its preferential accumulation within the proximal tubular cells in the outer medulla of the kidney. Tubular cell events activated by cisplatin toxicity translate into the fact that cisplatin predictably lowers glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a clear dose-dependent manner even after a single drug exposure. Early proteinuria is mild, as it is glycosuria. Overall these findings indicate that there is a pressing need for way to protect the kidney while administering effective chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin.\n\nPresent strategies for the treatment of acute renal failure have focused on targeting individual mechanisms thought to contribute to ischemic or toxic insults to the kidney.An alternative possibility is to adopt a novel strategy that would allow regeneration of the injured renal tissue. Renal recovery following acute tubular injury, like that induced by cisplatin treatment, is often a slow process requiring many days to weeks to occur. Attempts to accelerate recovery have focused on the administration of growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1. While growth factor therapy has been successful in experimental models, no beneficial effects have been observed in limited clinical trials. The ability of extrarenal cells to participate in the regenerative response following post-transplant acute renal failure may hold true for acute renal failure that develops in native kidneys after cisplatin therapy. The rationale for this approach rests on the recent demonstration in mice and in athymic nude rats that stem cells from bone marrow can be used to grow new muscle or blood vessels in heart tissue that has been damaged after myocardial infarction. Similarly, consistent evidence of the beneficial effect of bone-marrow derived cell therapy has been recently reported in humans with ischemic heart disease. This approach has been also successfully extended to repair ischemically and cisplatin injured renal tubules in mice. The observation raises the possibility that adult-derived bone marrow cells could be administered to enhance the recovery from renal injury. Although no human data so far are available, we expect that ex-vivo expanded donor bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) infusion would allow to accelerate tubular regeneration and thus renal function recovery in patients with cisplatin-induced acute renal failure, a disease that, like ischemically-induced acute renal injury, so far has no cure.\n\nUp to now there is no clinical study of repair tissue injury in patients with acute renal failure due to ischemic or toxic insults. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the effectiveness of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions like as inborn errors of metabolism,osteogenesis imperfecta,allogeneic HSC transplantation, treatment of acute GVHD, acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe aim of this pilot, explorative, study is to test the feasibility and safety of systemic infusion of donor ex-vivo expanded MSC to repair the kidney and improve function in patients with solid organ cancers who develop acute renal failure after chemotherapy with cisplatin."

Patients were recruited into three different dose groups, and 12 subjects were enrolled in each group. The subjects of each group will receive 0.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg, 1.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg, and 2.0\u00d710^6 cells/kg respectively. According to the principle of dose escalation, subjects preset to low-dose will receive the administration first. Each group will receive only one corresponding dose for safety and tolerability check. The subjects will be observed for 21 days after the initial dose due to limited proliferation or differentiation potential and relatively low immunogenicity of mesenchymal stem cell products. The safety measures will be discussed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether subjects who have received a single dose will proceed with subsequent injections. Once all subjects in the lower-dose group have completed the initial administration and observed for 21 days. The DSMB will decided whether to proceed with the next-dose group. All subjects will receive routine drug treatment during the study. Primary endpoint: incidence and severity of cell therapy related adverse events from the beginning of treatment to the end of the follow-up. Secondary end point of the study includes: the change in Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of the subjects from baseline, at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; the overall survival rate at the 12th month after the last administration; Changes in liver function compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; changes of child Pugh score compared with baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration; and the change of Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) score from baseline at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the last administration."

Standard therapy consists of a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which is efficacious in 80% of patients. However, current treatment strategies are complicated by frequent relapse after drug withdrawal, medication intolerance, and refractory disease. Alternative medical therapy may be need for AIH.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease condition in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in AIH patients\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus conventional treatment (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo plus conventional treatment. (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), \u03b3-globulin, total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA) and IgG, are detected at these time points.

                              "Since December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has been fierce and spread rapidly. As of 24:00 on March 4, 2020, China has reported a total of 80567 confirmed cases, 5952 existing critically ill cases, and 3016 dead cases. The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to 26 countries worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 infected patients, especially the critically ill cases.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the COVID-19 published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. Several reports demonstrated that the first step of the HCoV-19 pathogenesis is that the virus specifically recognizes the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by its spike Protein. This receptor is abundant in lung and small intestinal tissues, but is also highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in almost all organs, including the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The main organ injured by the HCoV-19 is the lung. In fact, HCoV-19 can also involve the nervous system, digestive system, urinary system, blood system and other systems. Therefore, when the initial symptom is discomfort of other systems in the early stage, it is often easy to be misdiagnosed and delay treatment. Moreover, the HCoV-19 is a noncellular form consisting of RNA and protein, which cannot be copied independently. It needs to bind to cell surface receptors to enter the cell to complete the replication, and then be released again. Therefore, once the HCoV-19 enters the blood circulation, it can easily spread to all systems throughout the body, which may be the pathological mechanism that the HCoV-19 directly or indirectly causes neurological symptoms.\n\nIt seems that the key to cure the COVID-19 pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung. MSCs, owing to their powerful immunomodulatory ability, may have beneficial effects on preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. MSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate.\n\nHere we conducted an MSC transplantation pilot study to explore their therapeutic potential for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. To explore the effective treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia for the current prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia to find a key and effective clinical treatment means, to fight against the epidemic."

Toxicity will be evaluated and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events, as Grade 3-4. If a patient is discontinued due to a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (i.e. dose-limiting toxicity, DLT), an additional patient will be enrolled at the same dose level to ensure that a minimum of 3 patients are evaluated. If 0/3 patients experience dose-limiting (DLT) at a given dose level, then the dose will be escalated for next cohort of 3 patients. If 1/3 patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If no other patient experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If DLT occurs in 2/3 or 2/6 patients, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be declared the MTD for the MSC cell infusions in this study."

In previous human studies, MSC infusion has been generally well-tolerated and safe, and in some cases, benefit was reported. The donor of the MSCs could be a relative or a stranger, and does not need to be the same individual who donated the stem cells for the stem cell transplant. All donors are screened for infectious diseases, similar to a blood donor. All donors have a physical exam.\n\nCorticosteroids may be administered with MSCs/ECP. Continued use of anti-infective medications, GVHD prophylaxis medications (including calcineurin inhibitors), transfusion support, and topical steroid therapy is permitted. Participants will be assessed for safety and tolerability using a continuous monitoring approach. In order to be included in the tolerability review, participants must have received at least 1 treatment with MSCs."

                              "A Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a treatment in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by COVID-19 is a pilot phase, open label, non-randomized study, with a single study center.\n\nThe current pandemic caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a health care crisis affecting hospitals, hospital workers and health care structure globally. Many countries are dealing with a disrupted infrastructure in health care and imminent economic downfall to an extent that has not been seen in recent years. COVID-19 has lead to a large number of deaths in several countries, and Mexico has not been an exception. Availability of supplies, hospital space and equipment for mechanical ventilation are running critically low, and it has been a challenge for hospitals coping with severe clinical symptoms in COVID-19. This disease is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough and occasional diarrhea, and the severity has been largely attributed to the high affinity of the virus to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main receptor, and the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease TMPRSS2 as the main host protease that mediates S protein activation on primary target cells in the lung and small intestine.\n\nMany agencies and professional societies are working worldwide in developing treatment guidelines to care for patients with COVID-19, since the present treatments are supportive but not yet curative, therefore these guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion, the use of an array of drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents that are being studied. Lately, Remdesivir, a novel small-molecule adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys has shown improvement in patients with oxygen support. The focus of the research for a cure of COVID-19 has been centered on the individual's response in an immunological context, where an over activation of the immune response can cause a production of a large quantity of inflammatory molecules resulting in a cytokine storm with severe physiological consequences. The cytokine storm induces an increase in inflammatory proteins that results in edema, improper oxygen exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other organ damage and secondary infection. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have proven to decrease the hyper inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to a steady recovery in patients with ARDS. The use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) may prove a potential effective measure for the treatment of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19.\n\nA step forward in a treatment strategy for the novel virus infection in humans would be critical for treating COVID-19 and especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently depleting resources around the world. Because efforts to control lung injury via pharmacological agents have been unsuccessful, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is being investigated, based on the characteristics of MSCs to self-renew in a limitless manner and their multipotency.\n\nFurthermore, MSC-based therapies have demonstrated in the past of having sufficient promising effects in experimental treatment of ARDS via inhibition of alveolar collapse, collagen accumulation, and cell apoptosis in lung tissue. Recent studies found that administrating allogeneic MSCs in patients with ARDS resulted in no pre-specified adverse events, including hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia. MSCs are currently attracting interest due to source potential, a high proliferation rate, and a painless procedure that is free of ethical issues. Selection of a starting dose of approximately 100 million cells has been chosen to approximate the standard dosage of cells employed in prior clinical studies. This dosage may be adjusted depending on the data generated during the conduction of the study.\n\nMSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are triggered further by the activation of TLR receptor in MSCs, which is stimulated by pathogen-associated molecules such as LPS or double-stranded RNA from virus, like the HCoV-19.\n\nThere are many pilot studies conducted with MSC transplantation to explore their therapeutic potential for HCoV-19 infected patients, in many of them the pulmonary function and symptoms of patients were significantly improved days after MSC transplantation. Thus, in this study we intend to prove the intravenous transplantation of MSCs as safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for patients in severe condition.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the feasibility and safety of intravenously administered MSCs in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess preliminary response in respiratory performance in patients with ARDS.\n\nTo assess overall survival of patients. To determine mortality rate at 14 days post treatment. To assess clinical and radiological improvements in patients.\n\nNumber of Subjects to be studied: 10\n\nEndpoints\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nEvaluate Respiratory distress symptoms based on Berlin definition (RR; Oxygen saturation at rest; Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / Fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2)).\n\nDetermine the degree of ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration in imaging studies (X-ray or CT).\n\nEvaluate clinical improvement based on APACHE II Score. Determine mortality rate at 2 weeks post treatment.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nAdverse events related to MSC infusion (description, timing, grade, seriousness, and relatedness) Hematological decompensation (based on CBC, SQ and metabolic panels) Objective response rate Progression free survival, overall survival, and best overall response rate Determine if any infusion reactions/toxicity occurs\n\nClinical and radiological parameters will be assessed at Baseline, 2, 4 and 14 day post-treatment, and there will be a 3 month follow-up by telephone contact."

                              "Stroke is the second leading cause of death behind ischemic heart disease worldwide. Traditional treatments have some limitations whereas preclinical data suggest that stem cell therapy is a promising regenerative medical treatment given the limited capacity of the central nervous system for self-repairs after ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that umbilical cord blood-derived Mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusion improves the outcomes of several neurological damage conditions, including stroke. These results encouraged us to initiate the phase I/II clinical trial aiming to evaluate the safety and the efficiency of UC-MSC transplantation in the treatment of patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke. This case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between 2021 and 2023. In this trial, 48 patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke will be enrolled into 3 groups: UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route group (16), UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal administration route group (16), and control group (16). The UC-MSC group (IV/intrathecal) will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x106 cells/kg patient body weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be measured using these scales including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-NIHSS, Functional Independence Measure -FIM, Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS, Fine motor skills-FMS, 36-Item Short Form Survey -SF-36. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months post-intervention."

                              "Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN< 0.2 \u00d7 109/L).\n\nAllogeneic BMT from an HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor is the treatment of choice for patients with aplastic anaemia.Transplantation for patients with severe aplastic anaemia from an HLA identical sibling donor is now very successful with a 75-90% chance of long term cure and with overall survival of between 65% and 73% at 5 years for matched-alternative donor transplantation. However, these two approachs are limited by the availability of HLA-matched donors.\n\nPatients without HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor can be offered immunosuppressive treatment (IST) involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). The treatment response with ATG is at best between 60-80%, 30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment. Moreover, a recent study has shown that on multivariate analysis of response at 6 months, only younger age, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), correlate with response to ATG. Patients with SAA or vSAA, with much lower ARC and ALC, were poor response to IST and have high risks of dying of infection and bleeding.\n\nNowadays, with advances in transplant technology, HLA-mismatched related donors and unrelated donors transplantation has achieved good clinical results. Data from the XJ Huang indicated that patients with HLA-mismatched related donors achieved 100% donor myeloid engraftment and have a survival rate of 64.6\u00b112.4%. Retrospectively analyzed results for 154 patients with acquired SAA who received BMT from unrelated donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program showed the probability of OS at 5 years was 56% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%).\n\nCompared with malignant disease, mismatched related donor or unrelated donor HSCT for SAA involves distinct challenges mainly associated with high graft failure and high GVHD. So, if we can find a way to promote implantation meanwhile prevent or reduce GVHD , the efficacy of HLA-mismatched related donors transplantation can improve.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non-hematopoietic progenitors mainly found in BM, cord blood, and adipose tissue. MSCs are attractive because of the ease with which they can be isolated and expanded ex vivo, their ability to undergo multilineage differentiation, and their lack of immunogenicity. These cells were shown to provide support for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in BM micro-environments. In additon, preliminary studies have shown clinical effectiveness of allogeneic MSC in the treatment of refractory graft-versus-host disease and an improvement in or resolution of severe aGVHD when co-transplantation with MSCs. Due to these properties, MSCs have become an interesting candidate for use in cellular therapy and are considered \"theoretically perfect cells\" for potential clinical use against AA mismatched related donors transplantation."

                              "ABO incompatible liver transplantations is considered to be a rescue option in emergency transplantation.The A\u3001B antibodies to grafts bind to the graft endothelium and activate complement, which attracts and activates neutrophils and platelets and increases the permeability of the endothelium. The neutrophils exude, the platelets aggregate, and the small vessels of the graft get thrombosed, resulting in ischemic damage,leading nonfunction grafts.In addition, if the A\u3001 B antibodies remain high level, it can lead to acute humoral immune rejection. A lot of research confirmed that the ABO incompatible is a risk factor of postoperative short- and long-term survival. And mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are characterized by the properties of immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, which make MSCs great attractive in treating immunological diseases (including transplant rejection) and organ/tissue ischemic injury. So we conduct this clinical study,to confirm the effect of MSCs in ABO incompatible liver transplantation by comparing the incidence of primary nonfunction, acute rejection, biliary complications and survival rates."

Regenerative medicine, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation, has developed extensively, with preclinical and clinical trials emphasizing the benefits of stem cell therapy for restoration of sexual deficiency. n our recent phase I clinical trial, we have shown that intravenous adipose - derived MSC administration was safe in female and male patients with hormone deficiency. Post-transplantation sexual satisfaction was observed in all patients enrolled in this study. Testosterone levels in males increased significantly after transplantation and were maintained at high levels for up to 6 months before decreasing again at the 12-month follow-up. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic administration of MSCs in middle-aged people with sexual functional deficiency. In phase II, 40 males with hormone deficiency will be recruited and divided randomly into two groups (n=23 each). The group A will receive UC-MSCs intravenously at day 0 and day 90 \u00b1 7, while the group B will be infused with UC-MSCs at day 180 \u00b1 14 and day 270 \u00b1 14. Each group will be monitored for 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion. The phase II is to investigate safety and efficacy of UC-MSC infusion for the treatment of sexual hormone deficiency in males.\n\nThe primary outcome are: (1) numbers of AEs or SAEs during UC-MSC infusion and 365 \u00b1 14 days after the first infusion; (2) Testosterone levels and sexual life quality through quantification of Aging Men Symptom (AMS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQoL-M) at day 90 \u00b1 7 and day 180 \u00b1 14 of the group A compared to those of the group B.\n\nThe secondary outcome are: (1) Testosterone levels and (2) sexual life quality through quantification of AMS, IIEF, and SQoL-M at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion of each group compared to the baseline; (3) cytokine concentration (TNFa, IFN-\u03b3, IL1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, IDO) in serum of the participants and their T cell immunophenotype at day 90 \u00b1 7, day 180 \u00b1 14, and day 365 \u00b1 14 after the first UC-MSC infusion."

This study will be concluded in 2 months, from May to July 2020, from subject selection to the end of follow up. Research subjects are obtained consecutively from Covid-19 patients who receive care in the intensive care unit (ICU) across four Covid-19 referral hospitals, including Persahabatan Hospital, Sulianti Saroso Center for Infectious Disease, Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, and Universitas Indonesia Hospital, with 10 subjects obtained from each hospital and total 40 subjects for this RCT. Subjects from each hospitals are divided into control and experimental groups. Subject belongs to the control group will receive standardized therapy (consisting of oseltamivir and azithromycin), whereas subjects in the experimental group will receive MSCs infusion, in addition to standardized therapy.\n\nSubject Criteria Inclusion Criteria for MSC Donor from Umbilical Cord:\n\nUmbilical cord is collected from elective caesarean section from a fullterm pregnancies without any complication and free from HIV, Hepatitis B, C, D virus, Cytomegalovirus, Rubella Virus, and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.\n\nInformed consent all of the subjects must be filled and signed up before ruled in this study.\n\nAs soon as after delivery, the umbilical cord is collected and processed in sterile specimen 0,9% NaCl at 4oC for 8 hours. The umbilical cord transported to the laboratory and cultured in GMP lab, at Stem Cells Medical Technology Integrated Service Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Cellular viability and proliferation are evaluated after cell characterization test by flow cytometer.\n\nSterility tests are done three times to ensure cellular sterility. Subjects will receive MSCs through infusion through intravenous for 1 hour, following the administration of diphenhydramine and anticoagulant to prevent clotting.\n\nFollowing the MSCs administration, monitoring at the patients is carried out every day, whereas laboratory testing for basic parameters (complete blood count, differential count, blood gas analysis, C-reactive protein, SGOT/SGPT (AST/ALT), Ureum/Creatinine, eGFR, electrolyte, procalcitonin, albumin, total bilirubin, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, troponin I and proBNP) are carried out every three days. Cytokine levels are measured before the administration and 7th day after the administration. Chest radiography is carried out every three days."

In each cohort, eligible patients will be randomized to the two treatment arms at the ratio of 3:1 (BX-U001: Placebo). The patients in the first cohort will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 0.75\u00d710^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. In the second cohort, the patients will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 1.5\u00d710^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. After the one-time infusion on Day 1, patients will be monitored for 52 weeks. During the study, besides BX-U001 or placebo infusion, patients will remain treated with their previous conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than biologics) in the same dosage/way.\n\nAt the end of Week 12, the patients will undergo efficacy evaluations to determine their response to treatment using the response rate of American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20). For patients who lack response to treatment as defined by not achieving 20% improvement on tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at Week 12, they will receive standard of care treatment including csDMARDs, biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and adjunctive agents such as corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and analgesics at Week 14.\n\nThe overall study duration is planned to be 2 years."

                              "This is a prospective, open label, phase one study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSCs are manufactured from umbilical cord tissue donated by healthy mothers delivering full term babies via Cesarean Section. The cells are extracted from the cord tissue, expanded and cryopreserved (frozen). One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant in this study.\n\nIt is hypothesized that immune dysregulation and/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that adversely affects normal brain development may cause core symptomatology observed in individuals with ASD. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated a multitude of immunomodulatory effects which are thought to be carried out via paracrine and trophic signaling. While MSCs modulate the immune response, MSCs themselves have low immunogenicity (the body does not have a strong immune reaction against them) and they do not permanently engraft in the recipient.\n\nAdults ages 18 to less than 35 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will have a screening visit that includes clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD, cognitive abilities, ASD symptom level, and confirmation of eligibility.\n\nOne dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant at a baseline visit. Participants will be admitted to the infusion center on the day of their baseline visit and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate) will be measured. Participants may require some sedation prior to IV placement if requested. A peripheral IV will be placed and prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Solumedrol, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs product will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluid maintenance will be given. Participants will be discharged after 1 hour, providing all vital signs are at their baseline and they are asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity. Participants will be evaluated the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications. A phone call or email will be done to assess safety of the infusion 7-10 days after the infusion. Remote follow up will occur one year after infusion. Participants will return to Duke six months after infusion for repeated testing and safety follow-up. The Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire assessing adverse events will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 12-months.\n\nThe main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization will be assessed. Key secondary endpoints will include ASD-specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after product administration. Exploratory analyses will include measures obtained by EEG, eye-tracking, pupillary light reflex, computer vision analysis, and tactile stimulation."

                              "Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is an important perinatal cause of long-lasting neurodevelopmental problems. Recent studies report an incidence of PAIS of 1 per 2300 full-term infants born alive. Adverse consequences of PAIS include hemiplegia, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy and speech problems. In 50-75% of infants, neonatal stroke leads to abnormal neuromotor and -developmental outcome or epilepsy. The estimated annual mortality rate of neonatal stroke is 3.49/100,000 annually. Current treatment options for PAIS mainly focus on controlling convulsions and associated infections. There is no treatment available that leads to reduction of neonatal brain damage in this severely affected group of infants. This leads to life-long consequences of PAIS and forms a large burden for patients and society. The overall aim of this project is to meet this need by developing a cell based treatment strategy. Animal models of neonatal brain injury provide evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of intranasal mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) application in the treatment of PAIS. Additionally, results from human trials with MSCs in the treatment of adult stroke or other pathologic conditions provide evidence that MSC treatment is safe. This project aims at making the first step towards clinical application of MSCs to treat PAIS. Successful completion of this project will provide the first evidence of the safety and feasibility of MSCs to treat brain damage in newborn infants. This study will assess safety and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs, administered by the nasal route, in neonates who suffered from PAIS."

CP Is a disturbance of movement and or posture . At the present time there is no standard medical or surgical treatment for it .Stem cell therapy is a new and promising treatment .\n\n150 cases of diparetic and quadiparetic spastic CP between 4-14 years old selected among the patients referred to the pediatric neurology outpatient department of Children's Medical Center Hospital (CMC) affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences and had our inclusion criteria. HLA analysis were done for these patients and 36 cases of class 6 matched cases enrolled to the hematopoietic stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MNC) because of necessity of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching in this type of cells and 72 cases among the remaining patients randomly divided to Mesenchymal stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MSC) and control group . Therefore 108 cases enrolled in 3 divided group of 36 patients .\n\nPatients admitted to CMC hospital and intrathecal injection were done with sedation . Only one injection of stem cell was done for each patient . In the control group after insertion of the needle into the skin with an appearance of lumbar puncture simulation , no injection were done without the awareness of the patients or their parents. All of the patients admitted for one day and discharged the next day . As we wrote in the consent form for ethical consideration we are committed to perform stem cell injection for control participants free of charge after 12 months of the follow up . All of the participants will be referred for neurorehabilitation with a identical protocol .Both parents and clinical evaluators are not aware of the 3 divided groups and our study is double blind .Outcome measures will be evaluated 1, 3, 6. and 12 months after intervention .\n\nStandard brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) were done before injection as baseline and will be repeated after 12 months of clinical follow up . This study designed for the evaluation of therapeutic effects of intrathecal MNC and MSC derived from allogenic umbilical cord in change and probable improvement of developmental functions of spastic CP patients between 4-14 years old in comparison with control group .Different scoring systems such as Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) , Gross Motor Function Measure Score (GMFM66) , Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) , Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) , CP QOL , Life Habits Questionnaire and Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity were done at baseline and then will be repeated in follow ups until 12 months of final evaluation .\n\nAcute side effects and probable long term side effects will be reported and noted on our preformed questioners ."

                              "Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it's serious problems.\n\nThe potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as GVHD, cardiac injury and brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. BM-MSC has also been used to treat human liver diseases such as liver failure and liver cirrhosis. In a phase 1 study, autologous BM-MSC transplantation has potential to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can improve the longer term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also look at how well BM-MSC is tolerated and its safety in LC patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times UC-MSC treatment at 4-week intervals.\n\nArm B: Participants will receive conserved treatment plus three times saline infusions at 4-week intervals.\n\nUC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are infused intravenously. After cell therapy, patients are followed up for 75 months. The evaluation of some clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin(PA), the rountin blood test are detected at week 12, 24, 48 timepoints. Clinical symptoms as well as complication were also observed simultaneously."

Umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) derived from mesoderm owns strong proliferation ability and multiple differentiation potential. The investigators used UC-MSCs via intravenous infusion to treat PD. With different durations of follow-up, the investigators cleared therapeutic effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of UC-MSCs on PD through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), revised Hoehn-Yahr\uff08H-Y\uff09 staging, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton depression scales 24 (HAMD 24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14 (HAMA 14) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In this research, the investigators seek new therapeutic approaches for PD, and provide clinical evidences for the clinical application of UC-MSCs in the future."

                              "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders, affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to the respiratory failure. Numerous studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the clinical and pathological features of ALS patients. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine) effect of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to enrollment. Patients are recruited for a clinical trial no more than 1 year from the disease diagnosis. Then, patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one application of WJ-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications (each administration every two months) of WJ-MSCs. Subsequently, allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period."

                              "Septic shock is a devastating illness and the most severe form of infection seen in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is characterized by cardiovascular collapse, failure of organs and is common with severe repercussions including a mortality of 20-40%. Survivors suffer long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models, MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore organ function, and reduce death.\n\nThe Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims, CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300 million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian centres over approximately 2 years."

                              "This is an open label, single centre study first in man study. The study will be conducted using the Simon two stage design. Nine patients will be recruited during stage 1 of the study. Once 9 patients have completed their 24 weeks visit, the study will stop for futility if only 2 or fewer patients have survived with the native liver. Otherwise, the study will progress to Stage 2 of recruitment, where the trial will continue to enroll a further 8 patients. A total of 17 patients will be recruited into the study (at the end of stages 1 and 2). At the end of the second stage, 7 or more patients out of the 17 enrolled should have survived with the native liver at 24 weeks post HMB002 treatment, to show evidence of efficacy of this novel hepatocyte transplantation that would support a larger randomised controlled trial.\n\nFollowing signed informed consent from parent/legal guardian, the following screening tests and procedures will be undertaken to ensure patient is eligible to take part in the study (some of these may be part of routine care).\n\nMedical and Medication History\nPhysical examination\nHeight and weight monitoring\nVital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation)\nUrine or serum pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential\nClinical blood tests and additional research bloods\nRecording of neurological parameters\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nQuality of Life - Parent and where appropriate patient questionnaires (optional)\n\nEnrolled participants will have pre-infusion checks and monitoring in the paediatric high dependency unit (HDU) or Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Children with acute liver failure generally require this degree of monitoring in any case. The child may be intubated and ventilated as part of routine care. This involves ventilation using a machine to help move air into and out of the lungs. If a suitable donor liver becomes available within 12 hours of planned study treatment, patient will go onto receive a liver transplant.\n\nFollowing successful pre-infusion checks, the solution containing beads will be infused manually into the peritoneal cavity with usually a 50ml syringe, as a single infusion or several infusions, to achieve in excess of 25 million hepatocytes per kilogram of the body weight. HMB002 infusion will be done under ultrasound guidance.\n\nParticipants will be continuously monitored before and for at least 24 hours after infusion in PICU/HDU. Some of these tests outlined below will be as per HDU and PICU standard of care. Once clinical condition permits and after 24 hours post infusion, the child may be stepped down to the paediatric wards.\n\nPhysical and neurological examination\nIntra-abdominal pressure will be measured using urinary catheter where possible, at regular intervals both before and after infusion.\nRegular review of the IMP infusion site\nregular Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation) \u2022 Clinical bloods at regular intervals both pre and post infusion.\nAdditional research bloods\nRecording of ventilator settings and additional supportive therapy given as part of standard of care \u2022 Ultrasound of the abdomen\nRecording of side effects\nRecording of change in medications\n\nParticipants will undergo daily examination until Day 7 while still an inpatient, and then be followed up at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 52. Participants will be discharged following a liver organ transplant or upon recovery of their native liver. Therefore some of the follow up visits will be done in the outpatient clinics at King's College Hospital. Patients will have some or all of the assessments below at each follow up visit. Some of these visits will be part of standard routine care.\n\nPhysical and neurological examination\nHeight and weight monitoring,\nMonitoring of Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation)\nClinical Blood tests and additional bloods for research (at some visits\u037e optional)\nRecording of level of ventilator settings and supportive treatment as given with routine care.\nRecording of side effects\nRecording of changes to Medication\nParent and where appropriate patient questionnaires at final visit (optional parents/legal guardian consent\nUltrasound of the abdomen at specified time points in the protocol.\n\nMicrobeads will ideally be removed within 4 weeks of infusion. This will be done at the time of liver transplant or upon recovery of the native liver prior to discharge (using laparoscopy, a small key hole surgery of the abdomen).\n\nParticipants will also be followed up for another 9 years after HMB0002 infusion for monitoring of long term safety. This will be aligned with routine care and will be conducted annually as a minimum but may be more frequent depending on the clinical condition of the child or young person. Clinical blood tests and abdominal ultrasound data will be collected annually during the long term follow up period (years 2 to 5 as per routine care). SAEs (with exceptions) will be collected for the duration of the follow up period as outlined in the study protocol."

Human umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have documented anti-inflammatory properties, which suggest these cells may be effective at treating Bradykinesia. It is understood that perinatal products are potent immune modulators. It is believed that the positive symptomatic effects are secondary to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in pathological inflammation. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia."

                              "Chronic kidney disease is defined as a reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased urinary albumin excretion, or both, and is an increasing public health issue. Prevalence is estimated to be 8-16% worldwide. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease and usually means that the patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT), which may involve a kidney transplant or a form of dialysis. One of the options in RRT is continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD is characterized by a continuous removal of extracellular fluid by peritoneal membrane. It should be noted that like any other peritoneal dialysis therapy, CAPD has Short or long-term complications and UFF is the most common functional disorder in which the peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damaged.\n\nThis project intends to evaluate, the role of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients who have ultrafiltration failure up to 6 months.\n\nIn this study, 10 male and female subjects who are on peritoneal dialysis for at least two years and have ultrafiltration failure with age range of 18 to 70 years will be enrolled. Patients will be selected from peritoneal dialysis patients attending the peritoneal dialysis ward of Dr. Shariati hospital. The main inclusion criteria is to be on peritoneal dialysis for at least last two years and having Ultrafiltration failure. After obtaining the consent form, a sample of fat tissue will be obtained by a general surgeon under sterilized condition from patients and then in the specialized lab, the mesenchymal stem cells will be separated and cultured to reach appropriate numbers (106/kg). The cells will be injected through peripheral vein in hospital setting. Patients will be followed-up (clinically and laboratory) at baseline and at week 3, week 6, month 3, month 4 and month 6. The clinical assessment and peritoneal function tests will be performed in each visit. Outcome measures: The main outcome measures that periodically will be assessed include: D/P cr, D/P urea, D0/D glucose, PET, KT/V urea, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)"

There is much interest in MSCs as they have the potential to not only affect the immune system but may also promote repair. This study will use MSCs that are harvested from the bone marrow and grown for up to 52 days before being given back to the person from whom they were harvested. This avoids any chemotherapy so is therefore safer than other types of stem cells. In this crossover study, everyone will receive their own stem cells back but in half of the patients it will be delayed by 24 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcomes are to check that the procedure is safe and to measure any changes on the MRI at 24 weeks. Other more exploratory measures will try to assess effects on repair in the central nervous system (CNS)."

                              "The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS. Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies, directed against human differentiation antigens (CD34, CD45, CD14, CD90, CD73, CD29, CD49b, CD166), conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (CFI) or phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from BD Biosciences (USA).\n\nIsolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) obtained from human bone marrow. In the present study, isolated EMFs from bone marrow (BM) from patients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic nonunion (failure of a bone union at fracture sites) will be used. These cells were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these patients. The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at the University Hospital of Caracas, Hospital Universitario de Los Andes, Hospital P\u00e9rez de Le\u00f3n II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient through informed consent. In this protocol, the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture in the iliac crest. This procedure was performed in the operating room, under anesthesia and by a medical specialist. The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) with heparin (Sanofi Aventis). The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium (Irvine Scientific, USA) enriched with 20% autologous serum. These cells were kept in culture in a controlled environment at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells were eliminated, and a basal culture medium (alpha-MEM-Chang / 20% autologous serum) was added. Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs. Culture medium exchanges were made until reaching a confluence close to 70-80%. The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures, following the process described above. Microbiological examinations were performed after obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation. After using MSC, a batch of these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C.\n\nPhenotypic characterization of MSC. Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried out by flow cytometry. For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask by using trypsin-like enzymes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD29, CD166 and CD49b) and hematopoietic (CD34, CD45 and CD14). Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100% of the cells used for transplantation in each patient were MSC.\n\nMSC differentiation studies. The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined by culturing these cells in osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media, following a methodology similar to that previously described. Briefly, the MSCs were detached and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well, proceeding to add the corresponding differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone (100nM, Biotech), ascorbic acid (10mM, Sigma), inorganic phosphate (1.8mM, Merck) and beta-glycerol phosphate (2mM, Sigma). For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes (Cell Application, USA) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial medium NH Adipodiff Human (Miltenyi, USA) was used. In all cases, the cells were kept in culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days. To demonstrate the changes associated with the differentiation process, the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (Merck, USA) and specific stains were performed for each case. Briefly, alizarin red to detect calcium deposition (evidence of osteogenesis), Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans (evidence of chondrogenesis), and oil red (Oil Red) to see lipids (evidence of adipogenesis). In all cases, microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out. For endothelial differentiation (CEn), EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, USA) enriched with 10% autologous serum, 10\u00b5g / ml of human epidermal growth factor (hu-EGF, R&D) and hydrocortisone (1\u00b5g / ml, Sigma).\n\nMSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. All MSC processing procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to induce bone regeneration. The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been phenotypically and functionally characterized. The MSC will be thawed, grown and expanded as previously described. A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs, and another part will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium (CEM-Endo). Once the required number of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached, a suspension of these cells (75,000 cells from each of them) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium, without phenol red, supplemented with 20% autologous serum. Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar, at room temperature, to the Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (IVIC).\n\nUnder sterile conditions, the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth area; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC / MSC-Endo / PRP implant. At the same time, the culture medium supernatant is removed from each tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo \"button (pellet)\" is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension, 5% CaCl2 and thrombin will be added. Immediately, and before the clot forms, 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP suspension will be placed in the root canal, covered with a collagen membrane. Subsequently, the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp chamber, ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the tooth.\n\nPost-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF\n\nClinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of EMC.\nRadiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of mesenchymal stromal cells.\nA tomographic evaluation will be performed when the periapical repair will be evident in a periapical radiograph."

                              "Ischemic heart failure (IHF) secondary to myocardial infarction is a common, lethal, disabling, and expensive condition. Despite advances over the last 30 years, the prognosis of patients with IHF remains poor. At present, there has been increasing interest in attempting to repair the failing heart with the use of stem cells, since this approach has the potential to regenerate dead myocardium and thus alleviate the underlying cause of IHF.\n\nA very primitive population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been isolated from a continuum from the sub-amnion to perivascular region of umbilical cord, referred to as Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). WJMSCs retain a combination of most of their embryonic stem cell (ESC) and MSC markers in primary culture and early passages, thus retaining their multipotent stem cell characteristics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that WJMSCs can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and to integrate into the vasculature and ischemic cardiac tissue, as well as to improve heart function significantly. Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with ischemic heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary or intravenous infusion of WJMSCs or placebo, to investigate the therapeutic safety and efficacy of WJMSCs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy."

It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."

MSCs will be derived from healthy donor umbilical cord cells and 1 dose of MSCs will be tested. MUSC has a good manufacturing practice (GMP) quality Clean Cell Facility to ensure the quality and safety of the MSCs prior to infusing into study participants. The goal of this study is to determine the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.\n\nThe MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually located in the arm or hand. All participants will receive standard of care and their safety will be monitored throughout the study."

A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of efficacy with disease progression.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype, morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.\n\nBM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes' markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals. Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and practical way for PD."

Pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies to SCI get limited effect. Another promising therapeutic approaches for SCI is cellular transplantation. Cell types used in SCI therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in SCI treatment.\n\nMSC have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing ,axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression.\n\nThe clinical translation of cellular transplantation strategies requires a safe and efficient means of cellular delivery. In animal models of SCI, the most common delivery is direct injection into the injury site, which allows a defined number of cells to be delivered, but risks further injuring the cord. Less invasive methods for cell delivery have been investigated, including intravascular delivery (intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial) and delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal). These minimally-invasive techniques decrease the risk to the patient and allow delivery of multiple cell doses. Maybe intrathecal administration is superior to IV delivery, cell engraftment and tissue sparing were significantly better after intrathecal delivery, but more researches are needed for get conclusion."

                              "As biologic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial data have demonstrated, inflammation is a key driver of coronary artery atherosclerosis, which is associated with pathologic injury and dysregulation of the endothelial cells lining the luminal wall of arteries, accumulation of lipids, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, \"foam cells\", and aggregated platelets at the arterial luminal wall, resulting in plaque formation. Circulating biomarkers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of cholesterol and other traditional risk factors. Recently, a gigantic proof-ofconcept trial CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) showed that an antibody that neutralizes IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2 can reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in secondary prevention, which provides intriguing support for the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover, another agent widely used to treat inflammatory conditions, colchicine,the LoDoCo study (Low-Dose Colchicine) trial has also showed a highly significant reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events over a 3-year follow-up, which also showed promise anti-inflammation in coronary artery disease. Therefore, these studies has demonstrated beyond doubt that inflammation plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis and, more importantly, that it can be effectively modulated.\n\nHowever, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. Colchicine causes gastrointestinal distress sufficient to warrant discontinuation of the medication in over 10% of individuals, the both of which severely limits the wide range of clinical applications. Moreover, more recent clinical evidence from the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) has come to challenge the above presented clinical data. low-dose MTX, when compared with placebo, failed to reduce the adverse CV events comprising the original primary end point regarding the cardioprotective effects of MTX. Evidence suggested that the inconsistent cardioprotective effects of different anti-inflammatory agents may be a reflection of the distinct pathways targeted. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and immune disease involving multiple cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and mast cells (MCs). Thus, therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit inflammation injury.\n\nThe latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. In low-density lipoproteinreceptor knockout mice atherothrombosis models, MSC-treated mice displayed a signifcant 33% reduction in circulating LY-6C hei monocytes, a 77% reduction of serum CCL2 levels, and signifcantly affected lesion development, which was reduced by 33% in the aortic root. These lesions contained 56% less macrophages and showed a 61% reduction in T cell numbers. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-\u03b2,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) .We found WJMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI in mouse AMI models. At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC possess a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in atherosclerosis. In particular safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and other studies.\n\nGiven the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs can drive beneficial in therapy of atherosclerosis. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly assigning 300 patients with coronary artery disease to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs or placebo , to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with coronary artery disease."

                              "Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated T-lymphocytes that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 \u00d7 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN< 0.2 \u00d7 109/L). Patients with nSAA can be offered supportive care, anabolic steroids, and/or low-dose steroids or cyclosporine (CsA).Patients with SAA and vSAA can be offered immunosuppressive treatment involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). However, some nSAA patients remains dependent to transfusion, the treatment response with ATG for SAA is at best between 50-60%,30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment, they also do not have a HLA-matched donor for bone marrow transplantation. These patients have a high risk of dying without additional treatment. Since the prognosis of these refractory and relapsed AA patients remains poor, there is a need for more safe and effective therapy that can improve response rates and remission duration in refractory and relapsed AA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are part of the bone marrow stem cells repertoire. The main role of MSCs is to support hematopoiesis. Recently, significant interactions between MSCs and cells from the immune system have been demonstrated:MSCs were found to downregulate T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK) and antigen presenting cells through various mechanisms, including cell-to-cell interaction and soluble factor production. MSCs can fully suppress T cell function which involves some degree of MSC activation or 'licensing' thought to involve interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in conjunction with IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or tumour necrosis factor-a. Non-specific suppression of T cell proliferation is mediated by soluble factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide, haem oxygenase products and insulin-like growth factor binding protein. Since the haematopoietic support and immunomodulatory effects, bone marrow-derived human MSCs transplantation maybe a safe novel therapeutic approach for patients with refractory and relapsed AA."

The autologous MSC-NTF cells are back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the muscles.\n\nNTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.\n\nPrevious open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit were also observed in some patients.\n\nThis multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six months at monthly visits."

After enrollment patients will be scheduled for amputation 7 days after MSC administration. The investigational treatment uses allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at the point of care. Allogeneic MSCs will be injected in the gastrocnemius muscle and anterior tibialis muscle of twenty-six (26) patients undergoing major amputation. Through a review of treatment related adverse events over 6 months we will test the hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs do not result in significant cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious treatment related adverse events. Through an exploratory investigation we will assess the efficacy of MSCs in promoting freedom from gangrene, revision of amputation, and death after major amputation."

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year."

This is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one or two intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with moderate to severe HIE who are recipients of therapeutic hypothermia. Infants born at 36 0/7 weeks gestation or later who have moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are receiving therapeutic hypothermia will be eligible to participate. Investigators project an accrual of 6 patients. All infants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of hCT-MSCs. The first cohort of three infants will receive a single dose in the first 48 postnatal hours. If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three infants will receive two doses, with the first dose given in the first 48 postnatal hours and the second dose given approximately two months after the first dose.\n\nThe potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization. Another risk of this study is loss of confidentiality or privacy. Every effort will be made to keep the infant's medical record confidential. The results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and statistical testing as appropriate. Continuous secondary endpoints will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, CV%, median, minimum, and maximum."

                              "Although HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency, a chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. In particular, this immune activation has been identified as a disease determinant independent of viral load or cell death in HIV-1 infection. A series of clinical evidences have indicated that activated CD8 T cells may attack body cells infected with viruses. Because of this, CD4 cells infected with HIV are frequently destroyed by CD8 cells.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the adult stem cells originating from the mesenchymal and connective tissue of bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord, cord blood, peripheral blood, liver, etc. These cells show immunomodulation, self-renewal, and multi-directional differentiation potential. In particular, MSCs have recently emerged as promising candidates for cell-based immunotherapy because they can modulate the immune response in various ways. A series of studies have indicated that secretion of dissoluble cytokines and direct contact with MSCs can block the development and functioning of antigen-presenting cells, inhibit the differentiation of B cells, and suppress the immune response of T cells and natural killer cells. The immunosuppressive effect of infused MSCs has been successfully employed in the treatment of acute severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, MSC may reduce inflammatory responses and promote tissue recovery in human diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn what dose of transfused MSC reduces the level of activation of CD8 cells in people infected with HIV. The decreased activation of CD8 cells may lead to a more CD4 T cell restoration in HIV infection. This study will also look at what dose of MSCs is tolerated and its safety in HIV- infected patients.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms:\n\nArm A:Participants will receive 48 weeks of low dose of MSC treatment followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nArm B:Participants will receive 48 weeks of high dose of MSC treatment followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nArm C: Participants will receive 48 weeks of saline placebo followed by 48-week follow-up observation.\n\nStudy treatment will be given at 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 week since the onset of treatment. There will be an additional 48 weeks of follow-up for purposes of safety. After treatment has started, participants will be asked to come to the clinic on Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48,60,72,84 and 96. At each visit participants will receive enough study treatment to last until the next visit. Each visit will last between 2 and 3 hours. At most visits participants will have a physical exam, answer questions about any medications they are taking and how they are feeling, and have blood drawn for safety to assess CD4/CD8 cell counts and viral load. Some additional blood will also be stored for immunology testing. At some visits participants will be asked questions about their medication and medical history, have pupils dilated, have a hearing test, and have an electrocardiogram (EKG). Some visits will require participants to arrive fasting. Pregnancy tests may also be conducted if the participant is able to become pregnant or if pregnancy is suspected."

                              "The role of regenerative therapies has gained more importance due to increased number of SCI in the wake of recent anti-terrorism operations by the armed forces and non-availability of any curative treatment for this category of patients. The promising results of preliminary clinical trials have proved that adult stem cells especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells can be safely injected and well tolerated and have shown functional improvement in SCI patients. The successful treatment in these patients will not only improve functional status of these otherwise debilitating patients, but can also reduce the burden on health care facilities. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression. In this study patients suffering from sub-acute and chronic phase of spinal cord injury shall be included. Patients will undergo detailed screening through MRI and motor and sensory assessment by ASIA score. Further evaluation will include electromyography (EMG) and tests for electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) will also be done. Bone marrow aspiration will be done from iliac crest of the patients, followed by mononuclear cells (MNCs) separation by density gradient centrifugation. MNCs will be washed and cultured in tissue culture flasks. After 48 hours non-adherent cells will be removed from culture. Medium will be changed twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence. At that point MSCs will be harvested and after microbiological and other quality control testing the cellular preparation will be diluted to final concentration and infused by intrathecal injection.\n\nPrimary outcome measure is safety which will be determined by clinical evaluation by two independent neurologists during one month of hospital stay after receiving treatment course.\n\nSecondary outcome measures will include American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and NCV/EMG."

                              "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) is the treatment of choice for many malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders. However, this treatment is frequently complicated by acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD), wich can be associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\nSteroids are still the first line treatment for established aGVHD, with a response rate of 30-50%, and there is no established and effective therapy for severe steroid-refractory aGVHD. The outcome for patients is poor and overall survival low, with few patients alive at 2 years.\n\nIn the case of failure after corticosteroid treatment, different therapeutic options have been introduced as second or third-line strategies. In this scenario, infusion of ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has emerged as an additional tool for treatment of GVHD.\n\nMSCs are non hematopoietic multipotent cells with self-renewal properties and the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues. Several lines of evidence in the past few years have confirmed the ability of theses cells differentiate into cells derived form embryonic mesoderm, such as osteocytes, adipocytes and chondroblasts. In vitro, culture-expanded MSCs express membrane antigens that can be immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The most widely accepted antigen expression pattern is cluster of differentiation (CD) 29, CD105, CD73, and CD90 positivity in 97 % of cells and minimal expression of CD45, CD34, CD3, CD14, CD19, or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR, which should be positive in less than 3 % of cells.\n\nBecause they are easy to isolate and culture and due to their differentiation potential and production of growth factors and cytokines, MSC have become ideal candidates for regenerative protocols.\n\nThe purpose of this work is conduct a study in patients with refractory and/or resistant GVHD corticosteroids treatment. It will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive the MSCs and the other group will follow the acute GVHD steroid-resistant and/or refractory treatment according to the routines of the Bone Marrow Transplantation service of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. It will be evaluated aspects of immune recovery early after MSCs infusion.\n\nMETHOD: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open label study to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatment of steroid-resistant acute GVHD with MSC. All patients with refractory and/or resistant steroids GVHD will be included after signing of free and informed consent.\n\nAfter randomization, patients will be allocated to receive conventional treatment:\n\nBasiliximab 20mg dose for adults and 10mg for children, 1 time a week or every 3 days if worsens the stage of GVHD until reaching Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or for a maximum of 4 doses, whichever comes first.\nIf after the item (1) will not obtained VGPR: Infliximab 5 to 10 mg/kg dose, 1 time a week, four weeks or even VGPR.\n\nPatients in the study group will receive two infusions of MSC per week during two weeks and 1 more MSC infusion (2 + 2 + 1 scheme).\n\nAfter 28 days, if VGPR is not obtained, crossover between groups will be allowed as well as for the patients with progressive GVHD in spit of treatment arm, before day +28. The latter group of patients, who use both treatments (MSC + Conventional treatment) before day + 28 will be analyzed separately.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived MSCs from normal BMT donors (third part) will be isolated and expanded under conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice. The quality control involves immunophenotyping, differentiation, microbiological control, mycoplasma and endotoxin tests.\n\nPatients response evaluation will be at Day + 28:\n\nComplete response: disappearance of all symptoms\nPartial response: with a decrease at least of one degree of GVHD\nVGPR: decrease to the stage I of GVHD\nStable disease: when there is a stability of the disease\nNumber and type of infection in the first 100 days after transplant\n\nThe transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, overall survival and the development of chronic GVHD or not, will also be evaluated."

                              "The acetabular labrum is a wedge shaped fibrocartilage structure attached to the acetabular rim. It is continuous with the transverse acetabular ligament at the inferior aspect of the acetabulum. The medial aspect of the labrum abuts the acetabulum to form the chondrolabral junction.\n\nAnatomic labral refixation aims to preserve healthy tissue and restore native joint anatomy and biomechanics. Labral tears that are caused by Femoro-Acetubular Impingement (FAI) require concomitant correction of bony cam lesions, pincer lesions, or both to prevent reinjury of the labrum. However, repair has not yet been proven to mitigate the osteoarthritic accelerating effects of labral tears. Many patients presenting with hip pain in the third and fourth decade of life already have osteoarthritic changes seen at the time of arthroscopy. Restoring the biomechanics of the joint via labral repair does not reverse this damage and investigating methods to repair early osteoarthritis is important to the future of hip arthroscopy.\n\nBone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has been used effectively in many joints for the management of chondral defect repair. As an alternative to the aforementioned chondral treatment modalities, BMAC treatment does not require multiple procedures or additional waiting time for treatment completion.\n\nWithin the technical constraints of the hip joint, bone marrow aspirate concentrate is feasible and potentially efficacious option for the treatment of chondral defects. Late stage hip osteoarthritis is a known factor implicated in poor outcomes in both the surgical and non-surgical treatment options available for chondral defect management. Preventing late stage hip osteoarthritis is paramount to decrease these poor outcomes and improve the patient's quality of life. Early and effective intervention with modalities that afford patients little to no drawbacks, like BMAC treatment, are necessary to achieve these goals.\n\nThis is a prospective study which will enroll 300 adult subjects with evidence of an acetabular labrum tear and pincer or cam deformity. Labral tears will be diagnosed by clinical exam and positive magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) findings. Pincer deformity is diagnosed with standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis, and cam deformity is diagnosed with antero-posterior and lateral radiographs.\n\nAdministration of diagnostic modalities is independent of study protocol as they are routine standard of care. Upon diagnosis, eligible potential subjects will be approached for study enrollment. After consent, enrolled subjects will undergo arthroscopic labral repair using a capsular chondrolabral preservation technique with or without BMAC based on intra-operative findings. The decision to use BMAC is made intra-operatively; therefore the patients are consented for the BMAC prior to surgery. If the chondrolabral junction shows advanced arthritis or the absolute absence of wear the BMAC is unnecessary and not used. This surgery in the absence of BMAC is considered routine practice and standard of care. Subjects will follow-up at routine post-operative intervals of 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter to monitor progress.\n\nInterval Results:\n\nMartin SD, Kucharik MP, Abraham PF, Nazal MR, Meek WM, Varady NH.

                              "Diabetes affects more than 9% of adults in the United States and this is projected to nearly double by 2025. Both diabetes and obesity are associated with endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endothelial cell inflammation, cardiovascular pro-thrombotic states and are the most common causes of kidney disease and blindness. Endothelium and its progenitors, meaning endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), are an established surrogate of cardiovascular risk outcome measures. EPCs have been defined as CD34+ cells thereby identifying a defined homogenous population from a heterogeneous peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells.\n\nThe investigator and others, have previously shown that EPCs can act as a cellular biomarker that is more reliable than serum based markers for CVD risk estimation. It was demonstrated that gene expression in EPCs change within two weeks of an intervention such as aerobic exercise. On the other-hand serum biomarkers usually take much longer time to change secondary to an intervention. Also the paracrine effect of damaged endothelium is secondary to gene expression changes that have been altered in the progenitor cells several months ahead of discernible changes in serum based biomarkers such as endothelium based inflammatory markers. When serum inflammatory markers are elevated that may mean that the endothelium is already damaged/ inflamed and possibly irreversibly\n\nEPC are the future endothelium, therefore studying EPCs may help us to predict the effect of an intervention (such as a medication or exercise) on the future of endothelium and endothelial function. In normal course of events, the EPCs transition to mature endothelium and replace endothelial cells after normal cell death cycle or programmed apoptosis. However, unfortunately, type 2 diabetes being a pro-inflammatory, high ROS disease process, chronically depletes the EPC population by up-regulating apoptotic pathways mediated by p53. As an apoptotic condition, hyperglycemia even mild (such as prediabetes) affects immature EPCs more so than the mature endothelium. Hence, the damaged and inflamed mature endothelium, with time, is not replaced by EPCs as the progenitor pool has been depleted. This maybe one of the reasons why vascular damage takes 4-5 years to develop following onset of hyperglycemia.\n\nIt is known that GLP1 agonist has positive effect on oxidative stress, and endothelial function, therefore semaglutide can be hypothesized to have a positive effect on EPC and endothelium and possibly reduce fat inflammation. It may also reduce transformation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) towards more fat formation (prevent adipogenesis) which may explain weight reducing capability seen in semaglutide studies (SUSTAIN trials). The use of CD34+ cells and MSCs as a biomarker is novel. One can obtain CD34+ cells from a simple peripheral blood draw (without doing an invasive procedure). The blood is then sorted for a homogenous progenitor/stem cell population. Role of CD34+ve EPCs in vascular biology, heart regeneration and collateral vessel formation as an endothelial progenitor cell is well established. It's role as a biomarker is also being developed. CD34+ cells are the most studied cardiovascular progenitor cells and its efficacy has been established in chronic diseases such as diabetes by Werner et al in 2005.\n\nSimilarly, one can obtain fat derived MSC from fat biopsies, particularly from overweight and obese individuals. Diabetes is not only a state of endothelial dysfunction, it is also a state of fat hyperplasia, insulin resistance at the level of muscle and fat and is associated with high ROS. Improvement of endothelial health is most likely paired with healthier fat. A state of healthier fat will be associated with healthy adipocytes, pre-adipocytes and healthy MSCs.\n\nThe weight reducing data from SUSTAIN 6 trial using semaglutide at 0.5mg and 1.0mg, is encouraging. It has also shown significant improvement in blood pressure and HbA1C within 8 weeks and definitely by 16 weeks even at a lower FDA approved dose of 0.5mg once a week.\n\nThese finding prompted the investigator team to use MSC as a fat surrogate and EPCs as an endothelial surrogate to establish a cellular mechanism behind the clinical trial findings. It may also shed light on cross-talk between these two important insulin responsive tissues that contribute towards cardiovascular health.\n\nThe Investigators believe EPC is the ideal cellular vascular outcome biomarker while MSC is the ideal adipocyte health bio-marker. Based on recently published data on saxagliptin's effect on EPC of subjects with Type 2 Diabetes, the investigators are confident that EPC is a robust endothelial marker with quick changes in number, function and gene expression, after appropriate intervention.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to study the effect of a long-acting GLP-1 agonist, over a period of 24 weeks and understand how it influences two different yet related cell types such as endothelium and adipocyte, both of which are key players in insulin resistance/sensitivity in the body.\n\nStudy Hypotheses:\n\nThe investigator hypothesize that GLP1 agonists, like semaglutide, have a positive effect on the EPC number, function, targeted gene expression, arterial stiffness and endothelium specific inflammatory markers.\n\nAdditionally, the investigator hypothesize that semaglutide therapy will reduce adipogenesis and increase bone and cartilage formation by increasing cellular metabolism, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial biogenesis and increased cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR, measured by SeaHorse)."

                              "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both. Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

It is expected that patients will receive 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed in total and may continue with maintenance pemetrexed thereafter.\n\nIf there are no DLTs within the first cohort then a subsequent expansion cohort will receive the same regimen of cisplatin/pemetrexed and MSCTRAIL and data from this expansion cohort will be used to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Between 6 and 12 patients will be enrolled into phase I of the trial depending on the number of cohorts assessed.\n\nPhase 2:\n\nA multicentre, randomised, placebo controlled trial comparing MSCTRAIL at the RP2D and pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy versus pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy alone.\n\nPatients will be randomised 1:1 between the intervention and control arm. Patients entering the intervention arm will receive cisplatin 75mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 on day 1 followed by MSCTRAIL at the RP2D on day 2. This schedule will be repeated after 21 days for 3 cycles.\n\nPatients in the control arm with receive cisplatin 75mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 on day 1 and placebo on day 2. This will be repeated after 21 days for up to 3 cycles.\n\nAt this point patients will receive a further 1-3 cycles of pemetrexed/ cisplatin alone.

                              "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and impaired quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is notoriously difficult to cure with 37% of patients experiencing refractory disease. As a result, patients cycle through numerous immunosuppressive medications that can have significant side effects, and >90% undergo multiple surgical interventions putting them at risk of incontinence.\n\nThe specific rationale for MSCs in perianal Crohn's fistulas is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; 2) several studies reporting the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of perianal Crohn's fistula; 3) existence of safe manufacturing methods for isolation and expansion of MSCs.\n\nThis study will enroll 20 participants that have Crohn's disease with medically and surgically refractory perianal fistulizing disease. Participants enrolled will be those that meet particular criteria for participation in the clinical trial.\n\nEnrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved, participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and again three months after this as above, and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of 18 months."

                              "As with other major joints of the lower limb that carry weight (hip, knee), the osteochondral lesion (LOC) of the talus, can be a major source of pain and disability for the affected patient. The LOC of the talus can appear after one (or repeated) traumatic injury, compromises the bone and adjacent cartilage, being able to cause blisters in the cartilage layers, lesions similar to a cyst within the bone under the cartilage, or fracture of the cartilage and the bony layers.\n\nThe ankle joint supports multiple loads of the corporal weight in the daily activities, the reason why the properties of the cartilage in the ankle are different from those that appear in the hip and the knee. In the absence of an injury, the cartilage of the ankle has better resistance and tension properties to face the increase of forces than the hip or knee throughout life.\n\nHowever, once an injury appears, the cartilage of the ankle appears to have less repair capacity compared to the hip or knee. Since the most common cause of LOC of the talus is post-traumatic, the average age of these patients is comparatively lower than that of patients affected by injuries to other joints.\n\nOsteochondral injuries have an incidence of 27 per 10,0000 inhabitants in the USA. They are injuries that usually affect the working population and active sportsperson, producing pain, functional limitation and that probably contribute towards the evolution of an accelerated joint degeneration. Currently, there are multiple treatment modalities used by ankle and foot surgeons. These include debridement and microfractures of the subchondral plaque, utilization of totipotential cells, osteochondral autograft/allograft, tibiotalar arthrodesis, and partial/total ankle arthroplasty. However, no treatment offers a clear superiority over the others.\n\nDebridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically is the most frequently used procedure and involves; the removal of degenerated cartilage and subchondral bone; obtaining firm lesional edges that prevent the spread of the lesion; and finally the stimulation of the bone marrow talar by performing microfractures of the subchondral plate. This with the hope that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Although this fibrocartilage has histological characteristics different from those of native articular cartilage, good results have been reported in 82% of the cases when combining good quality studies in this regard.\n\nThe standard technique is not able to generate a replacement articular cartilage strong enough to support the joint loads to which the ankle is exposed. Therefore, clinical trials seek to increase the traditional treatment of debridement and microfractures with the intra-articular use of totipotent cells at the end of the procedure. Although the results of these series are promising and comparable at least to those of traditional treatment, the absence of comparative studies between them complicates the choice of treatment for both the patient and the surgeon. For this reason, the investigators have designed a prospective, comparative, double-blind study that will allow elucidating which of these interventions is the best alternative for our patients.\n\nGeneral Objective:\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogenic stromal mesenchymal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nTo compare functional and radiological results before versus post-surgery within each group studied (control and experimental)\nTo compare functional results after surgery of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\nTo compare the quality of repair of the tissues of the groups in traditional treatment versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\n\nWork hypothesis:\n\nThe augmentation treatment of the osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal cells produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with only debridement and microfractures."

ARDS occurs in all age group of patients, where mortality rates increase in advancing age.\n\nIn animal studies of ARDS, mensenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can attenuate lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung injury and pulmonary permeability edema through modulating the inflammatory. These findings show that MSCs may improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of ARDS patient. Meridigen is developing UMC119-06, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs, for the treatment of ARDS. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of UMC119-06 in patients with ARDS."

                              "Context: Periodontitis are inflammatory diseases affecting the periodontium and characterized by the destruction of the tooth-supporting bone due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCLs). Two forms are described: chronic periodontitis (CP) and aggressive periodontitis (AP) that differ by the severity and rapidity of bone loss, much more important for AP than CP. In both forms, the link with uncontrolled activation of the immune system is largely admitted. But despite the physiopathology of CP is fairly well studied, very few data are available regarding AP. Based on the investigators previous studies, their hypothesis to explain this severity is the existence of a vicious circle involving immune cells, mesenchymal cells and OCLs, that would maintain and amplify inflammation and bone loss.\n\nStudy: this is a transversal, interventional and single-center study. It includes 3 groups of 20 patients: affected with AP, CP or controls (necessitating an extraction of wisdom teeth).\n\nAims: the investigators will compare the proportion of immune and mesenchymal cells in the 3 groups of patients to identify the populations potentially involved in bone destruction. The investigators will compare in vitro their capacity to induce OCL differentiation in order to determine their role in bone loss. The investigators will also compare the capacity of OCLs and mesenchymal cells to activate T cells, in order to determine their role in inflammation.\n\nMethodology: patients will be recruited in the department of periodontology, CHU of Nice. After signing the informed consent, a biopsy of periodontal granulation tissue (surgical waste) will be collected during the usual treatment of these diseases, as well as a blood sample. Then, patients will leave the study. Cells from the biopsies will be analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the proportion of lymphocytic, monocytic and mesenchymal cells. In vitro, their capacity to induce OCL differentiation or to activate T cells will be determined. From the blood samples, OCLs will be generated to study their capacity to activate T cells.\n\nChronology of consultations and examinations: 3 visits are planned: (1) a routine visit corresponding to the usual treatment of the patient during which it is proposed to participate in the study, (2) a visit to obtaining consent, clinical examination, criteria verification and (3) a visit corresponding to the usual treatment in which will be collected tissue biopsies and blood."

A limited number of therapies, such as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, have been approved to interrupt stroke in the early hours after symptom onset. Many patients are not able to benefit from these therapies, however, and so a need exists for development of new interventions to reduce disability after stroke. This study will be an early step towards this, and will examine the safety of two cell types, mononuclear cells and marrow stromal cells. In each case, the cells will be autologous, specifically being derived from the subject's own bone marrow."
