A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.\n\nScores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.",

Positive values indicate a greater change than would be expected, zero indicates change as expected, and negative values indicate a smaller amount of change than would be expected."

Binomial confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level and p-values for these groups will be calculated. Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore the effect of administration of MSCs on the composite endpoint at 6-months of death, amputation revision and gangrene, and will be compared to historical cohorts. The critical levels for the multiplicity adjustment will be determined by simple Monte Carlo simulation.Unanticipated SAEs and those affecting the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects will be documented and reported immediately upon discovery."

In addition for each category, the sum and difference between the two routes of delivery of the proportions will be reported as percent incidence. Confidence Intervals at the 95% confidence level and P-values for these four groups will be calculated. Since four previous trials have not reported adverse events with MSC treatment, confidence intervals will be generated by the method of the Wilson Score Interval."
