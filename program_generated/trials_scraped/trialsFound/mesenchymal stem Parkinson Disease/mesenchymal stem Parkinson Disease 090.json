Umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) derived from mesoderm owns strong proliferation ability and multiple differentiation potential. The investigators used UC-MSCs via intravenous infusion to treat PD. With different durations of follow-up, the investigators cleared therapeutic effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of UC-MSCs on PD through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), revised Hoehn-Yahr\uff08H-Y\uff09 staging, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton depression scales 24 (HAMD 24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14 (HAMA 14) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In this research, the investigators seek new therapeutic approaches for PD, and provide clinical evidences for the clinical application of UC-MSCs in the future."

                              "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of efficacy with disease progression.\n\nBone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype, morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.\n\nBM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes' markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals. Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and practical way for PD."

Earlier results with use of fetal mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe side effects.\n\nCurrent interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the striatum of the patient."

The safety outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body.

Patients' recruitment will be conducted by the study team, if eligible participants are identified based on eligibility criteria, a screening visit will be scheduled. Informed consent form will be given to the study participants and signed before any study procedures. Informed consent form will include information about the clinical trial and some aspects should be considered during this process.\n\nAfter Informed consent has been obtained, each participant should complete the following visits.\n\nVisit 1 - Screening, during this visit, the principal investigator will make the decision to determine whether the screened participant is eligible and whether the next visit can be scheduled. Once, the principal investigator has evaluated the eligibility of the subject screened (up to 28 days), a randomization process will be conducted in order to assign the eligible subject either allogeneic HB-adMSCs or placebo. Randomization will only apply to eligible subjects. If a study participant does not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the screening process, he/she will be considered Screen Failure (SF) and randomization is not required.\nVisit 2 - Infusion 1, (Baseline): this visit will be used as a starting point for comparison of participant's data. During this visit, eligible study participants will receive his/her first investigational product administration or placebo with monitoring of vital signs for a total of 2 hours after drug exposure. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 3 - Infusion 2: approximately 4 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 4 - Infusion 3: approximately 8 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 5 - Infusion 4: approximately 12 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 6 - Infusion 5: approximately 16 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nVisit 7 - Infusion 6: approximately 20 weeks after the initial investigational product administration this visit should be completed. Other study evaluations will be completed as part of this visit.\nPhone Call - Safety Follow Up: approximately 24 weeks after the initial investigational product administration, active study participants will complete a phone call follow up.\nPhone Call - Safety Follow Up: approximately 32 weeks after the initial investigational product administration, active study participants will complete a phone call follow up.\nVisit 8 - End of Study, during this final visit (approximately 52 weeks after Week 0) a complete group of study assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic HB-adMSCs or Placebo administrations."

With different durations of follow-up, we cleared therapeutic effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of the cord blood stem cell infusion on hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and evaluated the adverse reactions, through the neurological function score (NIHSS\uff0cBarthel Index), cognitive score (MoCA, MMSE),and the international uniform Parkinson Rating Scale score (UPDRS). Here, we seek new means for the treatment of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and provide the basis for clinical for further application of umbilical cord blood derived Mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nOn the basis of conventional therapy, at the same time, selected patients were given by intravenous infusion of umbilical cord blood stem cells 100-800 million. All patients before treatment, after treatment for 15days, 90days and 180 days were evaluated respectively the curative effect. The neurological function score (NIHSS score, Barthel Index) was observed in patients with the ability to live independently and prognosis; MoCA, MMSE were used in the evaluation of cognitive function \uff1bUPDRS was used in the evaluation of extrapyramidal tract function."
