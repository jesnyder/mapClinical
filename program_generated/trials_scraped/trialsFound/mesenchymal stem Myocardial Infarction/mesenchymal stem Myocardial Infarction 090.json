Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease. WJ-MSCs from the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy."

This year an estimated 700,000 Americans will suffer an acute myocardial infarction. The standard of care treatment for acute myocardial infarction (MI) usually includes immediate perfusion, optimal pain relief, oxygen, aspirin or other anti-coagulants, Beta-Blockers, nitrates and Ace-inhibitors. Management of cardiac risk factors such as tobacco use, hypertension, lipid levels, diabetes, weight control and exercise all work to reduce further atherosclerotic events. Yet, many patients go on to develop Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Medical management for CHF may improve symptoms and slow the progression to failure but does not restore a functioning myocardium. A therapy that could improve the myocardial remodeling process and reduce the incidence or severity of CHF following acute MI would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.\n\nPatients will receive standard of care in addition to stem cells or placebo."

                              "Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function. Today there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nExperimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and are found in all structural tissues of the body.\n\nIn the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.\n\nAmong the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017) that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial."

However, because salvaging the viable myocardium is dependent on early reperfusion, only a minority of participants will reach the hospital within the time-window for myocardial rescue. Thus, even if the participant manages their tobacco use, hypertension, lipid levels, diabetes, weight and exercise, many participants will go on to develop Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Though the medical management for CHF may improve symptoms and slow disease progression, such treatment cannot restore a functioning myocardium. A therapy that could improve the myocardial remodeling process and reduce the incidence or severity of CHF following acute MI would provide a significant benefit. The characteristics and biologic activity of Prochymal\u00ae, along with a good safety profile in human trials to date, suggest that Prochymal\u00ae may be a good candidate for addressing this unmet medical need."

                              "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths.\n\nStem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction.\n\nThe hMSCs are able to:\n\nPrevent reperfusion injury;\nPrevent excessive fibrosis;\nReestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.\nReestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis;\nPreserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration);\nPrevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis;\nLimit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity."

                              "At present, although the implementation of timely reperfusion strategies has reduced the acute mortality associated with AMI, improved patient survival has increased the incidence of chronic heart failure, due in large part to adverse remodeling of the damaged left ventricle (LV) following the initial ischemic event. However, recently, pathophysiological mechanisms of AMI reveal that begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense sterile inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes including neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI. Improved understanding in the interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling molecules within the injured myocardium have allowed development of novel experimental therapies. These therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit ischemic injury and prevent subsequent development of heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in particular, have emerged as potent paracrine modulators of inflammation that promote myocardial healing after infarction.\n\nThe latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. In mouse AMI models, we found MSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-\u03b2,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC possess s a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in AMI. In particular#safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and other studies in patients with AMI.\n\nGiven the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs can drive beneficial in therapy of AMI. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-infammatory mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly assigning 200 patients with AMI to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs, first time infusing within 24h after AMI or placebo , to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with acute ST-Segment-Elevation or Non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction."

Patients in the intervention group will be taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where the infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs will be done through the intracoronary route.\n\nBefore statistical analysis, adjudication of all measurements will be done by an experienced cardiology department member excluded from the research group. The adjudicator will assess the quality of each measurement and will exclude those with inadequate quality from the analysis, where they will be regarded as missing. An independent, blinded safety committee will evaluate potential major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Once the adjudication process is complete, the finalized database will be unblinded.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group. Treatment efficacy will be assessed according to the decrement in HF with the help of Cox regression analysis. The investigators will consider the EF to have improved significantly if a minimum increment of 3% is achieved after six months. The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat approach. The baseline characteristics of the two study groups will also be compared. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation, while frequencies and percentages will be given for categorical data. The EF, as the primary outcome, will be compared between the study groups using the independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The therapeutic effect will be estimated with a 95% CI. Two-sided P-values will be used. Safety will be compared between the two groups according to the occurrence of MACEs (death, recurrent AMI, ICD insertion, non-target vessel revascularization, etc.) and serious adverse events (SAEs). These events will be followed over time with Kaplan-Meier curves, which will allow us to understand their patterns. With the help of the Cox proportional hazards model, The investigators will assess the statistical significance and 95% CI.\n\nData will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent statistician external to the research group.

The DSMB will have the authority to stop the trial early if patient safety is compromised or if the primary research objective is met. All safety issues (unanticipated SAEs, mortality, intracoronary infusion complications, and severe arrhythmias, etc.) will be monitored by the DSMB, and the DSMB statistician will report the occurrence of safety issues in each study group quarterly. All deaths will be reported.\n\nThe investigators have discussed all ethical issues with the Institutional Review Board of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, which ultimately approved the study protocol (IR.SUMS.REC.1400.409). Informed consent will be obtained once patients are clinically stable and sedatives or strong analgesics do not alter their consciousness. Importantly, the use of low balloon inflation pressure and divided (three-part) infusions will prevent complications related to intracoronary cell infusion. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki will be upheld throughout this study."

                              "Thirty (30) patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization will be enrolled in the study.This is a phase II study intended to gain additional safety and efficacy assessments among two dose levels previously studied in a phase I setting. In this study, a 20 million total hMSC dose and a 100 million total hMSC dose will be randomly allocated administered via the Biocardia Helical infusion system in a blinded manner.\n\nThe technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium, which is often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts9, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent a highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths. It is estimated that one in three or approximately 80 million American adults have one or more types of CVD, with approximately 38.1 million of those estimated to be 60 years of age or older. The data was extrapolated to the United States population in 2006 from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 data.\n\nMortality data show CVD as the underlying cause of death (including congenital cardiovascular defects) accounting for 35.3% (864,480) of all 2,448,017 deaths in 2005, or one of every 2.8 deaths in the United States. CVD total deaths (1,372,000 deaths in 2005) accounted for about 56% of all deaths in 2005. Nearly 2,400 Americans die of CVD each day, an average of one death every 30 seconds. CVD claims about as many lives each year as cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes mellitus combined (NCHS).\n\nStem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion. Dib et. al., demonstrated the survival, feasibility, and safety of autologous myoblast transplantation and suggests that stem cell transplantation offers a potential therapeutic treatment for end-stage heart disease.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment. Allogenic mesenchymal bone marrow cells can be isolated from bone marrow. They are the primary cells used in tissue engineering expressing multiple cell types. Tissue engineering is very promising, generating hope that reconstruction of organs and repair diseased and damaged tissue may be possible.\n\nThere are two major types of aMBMC, hematopoetic (mononuclear) and stromal MSCs. Stromal MBMC, the cell type to be used in this study, proved to be more effective in reestablishing profusion as they secreted additional cytokine factors associated with angiogenesis. The multilineage potential of stromal MSCs, their ability to elude detection by the host immune system and even down regulate T-cell response allows for allogeneic multiple stem cell therapeutic use.\n\nOcclusion of the left main or left anterior descending artery causes irreversible injury to the cardiomyocytes in as little as 20 minutes. The goal of therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy is to limit damage in the following areas:\n\nLimit infarct size\nPrevent reperfusion injury\nPrevent excessive fibrosis\nReestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.\nReestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis\nPreserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration)\nPrevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction, preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity.\n\nAn IV study administering adult allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to 53 subjects following AMI showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction. The availability of \"off the shelf\" allogeneic stem cells will allow for an easily adjustable dose (getting enough cells in the autologous model is often a problem) for each individual subject. The ease of IV administration will make stem cell therapy more cost effective and safer to administer than the current catheter models. This study protocol will expand on the safety and efficacy of aMBMC in subjects suffering from ischemic cardiomyopathy."

                              "Ischemic heart failure (IHF) secondary to myocardial infarction is a common, lethal, disabling, and expensive condition. Despite advances over the last 30 years, the prognosis of patients with IHF remains poor. At present, there has been increasing interest in attempting to repair the failing heart with the use of stem cells, since this approach has the potential to regenerate dead myocardium and thus alleviate the underlying cause of IHF.\n\nA very primitive population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been isolated from a continuum from the sub-amnion to perivascular region of umbilical cord, referred to as Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). WJMSCs retain a combination of most of their embryonic stem cell (ESC) and MSC markers in primary culture and early passages, thus retaining their multipotent stem cell characteristics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that WJMSCs can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and to integrate into the vasculature and ischemic cardiac tissue, as well as to improve heart function significantly. Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with ischemic heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary or intravenous infusion of WJMSCs or placebo, to investigate the therapeutic safety and efficacy of WJMSCs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy."

                              "As biologic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial data have demonstrated, inflammation is a key driver of coronary artery atherosclerosis, which is associated with pathologic injury and dysregulation of the endothelial cells lining the luminal wall of arteries, accumulation of lipids, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, \"foam cells\", and aggregated platelets at the arterial luminal wall, resulting in plaque formation. Circulating biomarkers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of cholesterol and other traditional risk factors. Recently, a gigantic proof-ofconcept trial CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) showed that an antibody that neutralizes IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2 can reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in secondary prevention, which provides intriguing support for the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover, another agent widely used to treat inflammatory conditions, colchicine,the LoDoCo study (Low-Dose Colchicine) trial has also showed a highly significant reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events over a 3-year follow-up, which also showed promise anti-inflammation in coronary artery disease. Therefore, these studies has demonstrated beyond doubt that inflammation plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis and, more importantly, that it can be effectively modulated.\n\nHowever, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. Colchicine causes gastrointestinal distress sufficient to warrant discontinuation of the medication in over 10% of individuals, the both of which severely limits the wide range of clinical applications. Moreover, more recent clinical evidence from the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) has come to challenge the above presented clinical data. low-dose MTX, when compared with placebo, failed to reduce the adverse CV events comprising the original primary end point regarding the cardioprotective effects of MTX. Evidence suggested that the inconsistent cardioprotective effects of different anti-inflammatory agents may be a reflection of the distinct pathways targeted. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and immune disease involving multiple cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and mast cells (MCs). Thus, therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit inflammation injury.\n\nThe latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. In low-density lipoproteinreceptor knockout mice atherothrombosis models, MSC-treated mice displayed a signifcant 33% reduction in circulating LY-6C hei monocytes, a 77% reduction of serum CCL2 levels, and signifcantly affected lesion development, which was reduced by 33% in the aortic root. These lesions contained 56% less macrophages and showed a 61% reduction in T cell numbers. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-\u03b2,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) .We found WJMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI in mouse AMI models. At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC possess a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in atherosclerosis. In particular safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and other studies.\n\nGiven the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs can drive beneficial in therapy of atherosclerosis. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly assigning 300 patients with coronary artery disease to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs or placebo , to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with coronary artery disease."

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment and can decrease their serum cholesterol to near normal levels (Bilheimer DW, N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1658-64). Shortage of donor organ is a major problem for OLT. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organ. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders (such as Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Fox IJ, et al. N Engl J Med 1998;338:1422-6), Factor VII deficiency (Dhawan A et al. Transplantation 2004:78:1812-4), Glycogen storage disease type Ia (Muraca M, et al. Lancet 2002;359:317-8), etc) by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. Although, in the in-vivo system there is a controversy that if stem cells transdifferentiate into hepatocytes or fusion of stem cells and hepatocytes occur, however, in the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented (Lee KD, et al. Hepatology 2004;40:1275-1284; & Banas A, et al. Hepatology. 2007;46:219-28). We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 female patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of ABO compatible healthy male volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes in the in-vitro culture system. Then the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."

The investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation. The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae, Astellas Pharma), and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will receive basiliximab (Simulect\u00ae, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.\n\nUp to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30 days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a 2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90 days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.\n\nThe study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials."

                              "Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow. Experimental and clinical studies to date have shown that mesenchymal stem cells represent the most suitable cell type for regeneration therapy after myocardial infarction (MI). After injection into ischemic myocardium, bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) from various animal species can differentiate into multiple cell lineages, including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, thereby improving LV function.\n\nIn Malaysia we have previously demonstrated our capability in isolating and extracting MSC from a small volume of bone marrow aspirates.The isolation, expansion and feasibility of storage, transport and differentiation of human MSC for clinical application has been performed locally. The researchers used autologous BM-MSC, ex vivo expanded, on three patients with end-stage ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who were on the heart transplant waiting list and each patient was injected with MSCs directly into the myocardium during open heart surgery. After twelve months, all patients remained alive and well with significant improvement in cardiac function, quality of life and other parameters including reduction of myocardial scar volume as seen from cardiac scans.\n\nThe same group of researchers further carried out a study on ten patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and refractory cardiac function despite maximum medical therapy to receive autologous BM-MSC implantation via intramyocardial or intracoronary route. All patients remained alive at 1 year while recorded significant improvements in LV ejection fraction and other LV parameters from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Reduction in scar was also noted in six of the patients by 12 months.\n\nFollowing these results, this study aims to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population."
