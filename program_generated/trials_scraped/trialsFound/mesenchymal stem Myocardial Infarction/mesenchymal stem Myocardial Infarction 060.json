                              "Early reperfusion strategies in tandem with remarkable advances in drugs and devices for treating myocardial infarction (MI) have contributed to a reduction in early mortality, but cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI."

The novelty of the current UMSC01 treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion."

Today, there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure and in more advanced stages the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is heart transplantation.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells found from embryonic mesoderm and found in all tissues. In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when treated with MSCs from different origins. Our approach is based on a decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction."

                              "Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by a series of time-dependent events orchestrated by the innate immune system. This begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense sterile inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes including monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI. There is increasing evidence to suggest inflammation is not limited to the infarcted myocardium and systemic imbalances in the post-infarct inflammatory cascade can exacerbate adverse remodelling beyond the infarct site. Therefore, it is very important that therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and antiinflammatory pathways timely after AMI. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been shown to exhibit immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and paracrine secretion of bioactive factors that can attenuate inflammation and promote tissue regeneration, making them a promising cell source for AMI therapy. However, it has been proved in our and other studies that perfusion of WJMSCs after 5 days of AMI can only slightly improve left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is the most important indicator of left ventricular remodeling. Thus, WANIAMI Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase#study designed to assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of WJMSCs in the treatment of patients in the acute phase ( within 24h) with the both of ST-Segment-Elevation or Non-ST-Segment-Elevation AMI."

However, no study has evaluated the effect of the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on a clinical endpoint such as HF.\n\nThis single-blinded, randomized, multicenter trial aims to establish whether the intracoronary infusion of umbilical cord-derived Wharton's jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) helps prevent HF development after AMI. The study will enroll 240 patients 3 to 7 days following an AMI treated with primary percutaenous coronary intervention (PPCI). Only patients aged below 65 years with impaired LV function (LVEF < 40%) will be included. They will be randomized to receive either a single intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or standard care. The primary outcome of this study is the assessment of HF development during long-term follow-up (four years). Since the efficacy of MSCs is higher than BM-MNCs after AMI in the improvement of LVEF, it would be probable that these cells may have a better clinical effect as well. However, no study has evaluated the impact of the transplantation of MSCs on a clinical endpoint such as HF.

                              "Heart attacks are a leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. When a person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes, these treatments can not reverse the original damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of injecting MSCs into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who have had a heart attack and who are having heart surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nChronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

                              "Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. When a person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes, these treatments can not reverse the all damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs directly into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who have had a heart attack and who have chronic myocardial ischemia with heart failure."

Recently, a gigantic proof-of-concept trial, CANTOS has demonstrated that inflammation of atherosclerosis can be effectively modulated by Canakinumab. However, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. There is, therefore, a clear need for cheaper and safe alternatives. The latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells and induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, which could reduce atherosclerosis in pre-clinical studies. Therefore, in this randomized, controlled trial, our aim was to assess the safety and the anti-inflammatory efficacy of intravenous infusion human umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem Cell (WJMSC) in patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis disease."

                              "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has very high serum cholesterol levels despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment for that. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of donor organs. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders by hepatocyte transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. In the in-vitro culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes has been documented. We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In Press). In this study, 2 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will be included. The bone marrow of healthy volunteers with a normal lipid profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes, and the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow up will be 6 months post-transplantation."

                              "The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.\n\nCurrently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority of the trials.\n\nNon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease."

These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) infusion compared to saline-only infusion in reducing the immune suppression necessary to achieve optimal renal function in renal transplant recipients.

                              "Ischemic heart disease is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in the Western world and is a public health problem. Among ischemic heart diseases, myocardial infarction has specific significance because the cardiac muscle does not have sufficient and adequate capacity to regenerate; therefore, necrosis of a region leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. Infarction can lead to a progressive and irreversible decrease in cardiac function, resulting in heart failure (HF) syndrome, depending on the area affected by this scar, via a ventricular remodeling mechanism.\n\nIn recent years, HF has been revealed as a major public health problem due to its incidence and its social, economic and especially human impact, as it represents a serious limitation of the quality of life of individuals. The prevalence of HF in the general population of the United States and the United Kingdom is approximately 1%, and in those older than 75 years, the prevalence varies between 5 and 10%. Regarding its prognosis, recent data from the Framingham Study indicate that at 5 years, the mortality rate of HF is 75% in men and 62% in women; the mean mortality rate of all cancers is 50%.\n\nThe molecular basis of congestive HF is the absence of cardiac cells capable of regenerating the heart muscle. Despite the publication of recent studies suggesting the existence of stem cells capable of regenerating cardiomyocytes destroyed because of myocardial infarction, in humans, the capacity of these cells is insufficient to replace the cells destroyed due to necrosis secondary to ischemia.\n\nIn recent years, the accumulation of results derived from preclinical studies has allowed the development of the first clinical trials of the feasibility and safety of cardiac regeneration using cellular therapy. Several studies have shown that t cells exist in adult bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and, more recently, multipotent stem cells (MAPC), with the ability to differentiate into endothelial tissue and cardiac muscle, which can contribute to the regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function in animal infarction models. However, cell therapy research has moved rapidly toward the use of more undifferentiated cells rather than hematopoietic lineages, such as mesenchymal cells. These cells can be obtained from different sources, with a tendency toward the use of characterized allogeneic cells, which are immediately available in the potential recipient. Given that this type of therapy has not been rigorously investigated in Latin America, we aim to determine the effect of therapy using Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells (WJ-MSCs) from the human umbilical cord on neomyogenesis in patients with previous myocardial infarction who are undergoing open revascularization. Our hospital has some experience with regenerative therapy, both in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic infarction, with encouraging results that support this new phase of inter-institutional research.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the safety and estimate the effect of coronary revascularization accompanied by intramyocardial injection of WJ-MSCs and the placement of an extracellular matrix patch seeded with WJ-MSCs compared to coronary revascularization accompanied by injection of culture medium without the presence of WJ-MSC and placement of an extracellular matrix patch without seeding with WJ-MSC on global and regional cardiac function, myocardial viability and the incidence of adverse effects determined as ventricular arrhythmias."

                              "Despite the recent advances in medical and surgical treatment, heart failure resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) remains the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow.This study aims to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population."

                              "Several studies have documented that transplantation of bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) following acute myocardial infarction is associated with a reduction in infarct scar size and improvements in left ventricular function and perfusion. The available evidence in humans suggests that BMC transplantation is associated with improvements in physiologic and anatomic parameters in both acute myocardial infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease, above and beyond the conventional therapy. In particular, intracoronary application of BMC is proved to be safe and was associated with significant improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure.\n\nIn contrast to ischemic heart failure, the data on effects of BMC transplantation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are limited to pre-clinical studies. In a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy, intramyocardial delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal cells improved LVEF, possibly through induction of myogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as by inhibition of myocardial fibrosis, suggesting that the beneficial effects of stem cell transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy may primarily be related to their ability to supply large amounts of angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and mitogenic factors. Similarly, transplantation of cocultured mesenchymal stem cells and skeletal myoblasts was shown to improve LVEF in a murine model of Chagas disease.\n\nStudy Aim:\n\nTo define the clinical effects of BMC transplantation in dilated cardiomyopathy in a pilot clinical study investigating the effects of intracoronary CD34+ cell transplantation on functional, structural, neurohormonal, and electrophysiologic parameters in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy."

                              "Background:\n\nImproving implantation rates in ICSI cycles has been the focus of research in recent decades. Because success rates is not satisfactory enough especially when transferring good embryos to the uterine cavity and pregnancy does not occur. Trying to improve endometrial receptivity, the investigators have thought about stem cell therapy as stem cells have played a pivotal role in regenerative medicine in many pathologies as myocardial infarction, Diabetes Mellitus and spinal cord injuries.\n\nGarget and Healy reported in 2011 treatment of a case with Asherman's syndrome by administration of bone marrow stem cells in the uterine cavity. Endometrial growth and improved vascularity has been observed by ultrasound follow-up and Doppler study of endometrial blood flow. Endometrial regeneration has been enough to support pregnancy through successful IVF trial.\n\nThe investigators have succeeded in previous work to isolate MSC from placental tissue and differentiate it to endometrium-like cells. The investigators compared the differentiation ability of placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Wharton Jelly derived MSC to differentiate to endometrium under 3 different culture conditions: endometrium conditioned medium (ECM), follicular fluid (FF) conditioned medium and medium containing both. The investigators found that placental MSC has better differentiating ability to endometrium especially under culture conditions containing both ECM and FF as evidenced by prominent appearance of glandular pattern and expression of progesterone receptors in differentiated cells.\n\nTherefore the investigators need to direct this study and test the effect of placental derived MSC in improving implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure, unresponsive endometrium to ovulation induction drugs or with endometrial atrophy or advanced maternal age planning for ICSI trial.\n\nPatients and Methods:\n\n60 patients attending Kasr El-Aini assisted reproduction unit and private IVF center will be randomized to three groups by computer generated programs:\n\nThe first group, patients randomized to receive differentiated stem cell therapy:\n\nAfter ovum pick-up, MSC differentiated to endometrium is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter. Embryo transfer will be done at day 5 at the blastocyst stage to allow enough time for endometrial regeneration and increased endometrial receptivity.\n\nThe second group, patients randomized to receive undifferentiated stem cell therapy:\n\nImmediately postmenstrual undifferentiated MSC is deposited in the uterine cavity through an IUI catheter to allow enough time for the MSC to differentiate as it needs 7-10 days for differentiation. Ovum pick-up will be done as usual while all other steps will be the same including embryo transfer which will be done at day 5.\n\nThe third group, control group:\n\nPatients are randomized to receive no stem cell therapy; All ICSI steps from ovulation induction protocol to embryo transfer conditions will be the same for all groups.\n\nInformed consent will be taken from the patients after detailed explanation of all steps of the procedure."
