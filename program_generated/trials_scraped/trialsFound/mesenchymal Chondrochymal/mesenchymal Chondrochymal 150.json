Donors aged 20 to 50 and tested negative to infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 (HIV-1/2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II), and Tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled. The eligible donor's bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest or femur. The collected BM-MSCs were then cultured, expanded and cryopreserved in a Good Tissue Practice (GTP)-complied laboratory. The qualified cells in cryopreservation meeting the release criteria will be thawed, mixed with lactated Ringer's solution, and transferred into a sterile syringe as the final product.",
