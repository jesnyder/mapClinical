It is a 24-item patient-reported questionnaire with a total score ranging from 0 to 96. The sub-scores range from 0 to 4 for each item with a higher score indicating a more severe OA symptom. The WOMAC includes 3 domains: (1) Pain: 5 items (score range: 0 to 20), (2) Stiffness: 2 items (score range: 0 to 8), and (3) Functional limitation: 17 items (score range: 0 to 68).\n\nFor ease of interpretation, WOMAC scores (including total scores and sub-scores) will be linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale."
