It is a 24-item patient-reported questionnaire with a total score ranging from 0 to 96. The sub-scores range from 0 to 4 for each item with a higher score indicating a more severe OA symptom. The WOMAC includes 3 domains: (1) Pain: 5 items (score range: 0 to 20), (2) Stiffness: 2 items (score range: 0 to 8), and (3) Functional limitation: 17 items (score range: 0 to 68).\n\nFor ease of interpretation, WOMAC scores (including total scores and sub-scores) will be linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale.",

It is a scale of 10 cm in length, representing the subject's pain intensity with higher scores indicating more severe pain. VAS score ranges from 0 to 10 cm, and will be transformed to a \"0 to 100\" mm scale.",

It has 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The SF-36 QoL questionnaire consists of 8 scaled scores in various health domains including 4 items in vitality, 10 items in physical functioning, 2 items in bodily pain, 5 items in general health perceptions, 4 items in physical role functioning, 3 items in emotional role functioning, 2 items in social role functioning, and 5 items in mental health. The score for each domain will be transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, on which zero corresponds to \"worst health status\" and 100 to \"best health status\".",

The WORMS, diffusion mapping (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), and T2 map values (it is a value from the worst region for screening visit), will be recorded in the CRF to evaluate the effect on knee cartilage response.\n\nWORMS are used to evaluate the articular cartilage lesions at three joints, including 14 anatomic compartments as follows (Peterfy et al., 2004)",

The acceptable NSAIDs are Etoricoxib and Celebrex. The maximum oral doses for acetaminophen, Etoricoxib, and Celebrex are \u2264 2000 mg/day, \u2264 120 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively, while the topical use of these three rescue medications is allowed at any dose levels.",
