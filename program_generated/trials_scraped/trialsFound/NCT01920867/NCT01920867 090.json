                              "Eyes with loss of vision from retinal or optic nerve conditions generally considered irreversible will be treated with a combination of injections of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells isolated from the bone marrow using standard medical and surgical practices. Retinal conditions may include degenerative, ischemic or physical damage ( examples may include macular degeneration, hereditary retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa, stargardt, non-perfusion retinopathies, post retinal detachment. Optic Nerve conditions may include degenerative, ischemic or physical damage ( examples may include optic nerve damage from glaucoma, compression, ischemic optic neuropathy, optic atrophy ). Injections may include retrobulbar, subtenon, intravitreal, intraocular, subretinal and intravenous. Patients will be followed for 12 months with serial comprehensive eye examinations including relevant imaging and diagnostic ophthalmic testing."
