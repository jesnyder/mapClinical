Approximately ninety percent of the protocol biopsies of renal allografts, performed at 18 months post transplantation, show histological lesions of chronic calcineurin nephrotoxicity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) has been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. Some patient in this study will also receive two infusions of expanded MSC. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC infusions in patients .\n\nThis study will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the full immunosuppressive therapy and MSC infusions (Group 1) or immunosuppressive therapy alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study on Day 0. One year post- infusions, patients will be evaluated. At Months 12 participants will undergo kidney biopsies. Blood collection will occur at regular intervals, Serum creatinine and the estimated creatinine clearance will be monthly recorded. The transplanted kidney function will be evaluated."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage organ failure. Despite dramatic improvements in short-term survival, long-term survival of renal allografts has changed little during the past decade. Recently, it has been demonstrated that chronic lesions originate already very early after transplantation and that subclinical rejection (SCR) in protocol biopsies is a risk factor for late graft loss. However the efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids and other therapies for the treatment of SCR have been shown to be inadequate. Thus, despite the availability of a range of available medications there remains a need for therapeutic alternatives because patients may not respond to existing therapeutic choices, they do not show an improvement of the fibrosis reaction or an effect on long term survival, or they may develop immunosuppression induced serious (sometimes fatal) side effects and toxicities.\n\nIn recent years it has become evident that bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells have potent immunomodulatory effects. MSCs are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. MSCs have potent immunosuppressive effects on T and B cells in vitro and in animal models of chronic inflammation. Encouraging results have been obtained in patients with steroid resistant acute and severe Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). The investigators hypothesize that infusion of MSCs may similarly provide a novel treatment option in the treatment of patients with allograft rejection with less side effects than existing immunosuppressive therapies.This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of MSC therapy in renal recipients.\n\nIn total 15 de novo renal recipients of 2 HLA-DR mismatched living donors, men and women, 18-65 years of age, will be recruited from the renal transplant clinics of the LUMC. Only patients with SCR abd or an increase in IF/TA in the protocol biopsy 4 weeks or 6 months after transplantation will receive MSC infusions. MSCs from patients without SCR in their biopsy will be only used for feasibility and function studies (as described earlier). Subjects will receive two doses of 1 x 10.6 MSCs per kilogram body weight, intravenously, 7 days apart. The investigators will investigate safety of MSC therapy by assessing the rate of (serious) adverse events in the study population using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Feasibility will be obtained by determining the number of expanded MSCs in relation to the amount of BM collected, number of passages required and time to reach study target doses."

                              "Articular cartilage injuries in the knee continue to grow in number as detection and treatment options have advanced. Treatment options, including microfracture, autologous chondrocyte (cells that make cartilage) implantation, osteochondral grafting and meniscus transplantation can hopefully deter the progression of degeneration and have promise to function as disease modifying solutions. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) has emerged as a preferred method of treating large focal chondral defects as it structurally replaces the cartilage and often involved sub-chondral bone with native hyaline cartilage and bone. The results of OCA are successful with greater than 85% survival at 5-year follow-up. Failure can occur due to a lack of boney integration or low chondrocyte viability. Therefore, anything to enhance the graft augmentation process may be useful in preventing failure. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study is to determine the effect of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) containing bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on improving graft incorporation and preventing failure. The effect of BMAC on the graft and intra-articular knee environment will be evaluated using 3 techniques: computed tomography (CT) imaging, synovial fluid cytokine analysis, and serum biomarker analysis. Information learned from this study can be used to biochemically compare treatment response and to assess emerging therapeutic options that may positively alter the biochemical environment in patients undergoing osteochondral allograft transplantation."

                              "Background:The most common problem following a kidney transplant is the development of acute or chronic rejection. Rejection is the immunologic reaction in which the body refuses to accept the transplanted organ. The body's immune system will make destructive antibodies that will attempt to attack the transplanted organ.\n\nIn order to prevent organ rejection, all patients receiving an allograft (a graft transplanted between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species) must take anti-rejection (immunosuppressive) therapy. These medications function by lowering the body's natural immune system. Often these medications are associated with significant side effects ranging from infections to cancer.\n\nStudy:\n\nThis is a single center, open label, dose-escalation clinical trial in 6 adult recipients of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)- non-identical, living-donor renal allografts. All participants will receive induction therapy with alemtuzumab followed by maintenance therapy with sirolimus and belatacept.\n\nA total of 3 dosing cohorts of 2 recipients each will receive 12 infusions of donor-derived MSCs starting on Day 42 post-transplant and every 4 weeks starting on Day 56 post-transplant, with a minimum of 7 days between the first and second MSC infusions.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine whether immune reconstitution after lymphocyte depletion in the setting of co-stimulatory blockade and systemic MSC-derived donor antigen can promote operational tolerance in recipients of kidney allografts.\n\nParticipants will be evaluated for eligibility for sirolimus withdrawal any time between week 52 and week 104 post-transplant. Participants who successfully complete sirolimus withdrawal will remain on belatacept monotherapy for at least 24 weeks before being assessed for eligibility to discontinue belatacept. Participants who successfully complete Immunosuppression Withdrawal (ISW) will then undergo 24 weeks of high frequency follow up followed by 132 weeks of standard follow up.\n\nStudy participation may continue for up to seven (7) years after kidney transplant surgery.\n\n*** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed, controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider."

                              "Liver transplantation is the only lifesaving intervention for patients with end-stage liver diseases. The current immunosuppressive agents reduce the incidence of acute cellular rejection; however, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term side effects of these regimens now has become a major challenge for liver transplant recipients and is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need, for example, increases in the incidence of bacterial, viral infections, nephrotoxicity with chronic renal impairment, de novo diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurotoxicity, hematological toxicity.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Current clinical trails demonstrated that the use of autologous bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) for renal transplanted patients resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function. Compared with BM-MSC, umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) may be the better choice for clinical application. One main reason is that the collection of BM-MSC from liver transplanted patients would be harmful for the patients. Moreover, the proliferative abilities of BM-MSC from patients with liver disease are deficient, whereas, UC-MSC can be obtained from discarded umbilical cords and can be produced on a larger scale. Our and other studies reported that the infusion of human UC-MSC are feasible and can improve liver function of liver fibrosis and liver failure.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the conditions in liver transplanted patients. This study will also look at how well UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in liver transplanted patients.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\nArm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus UC-MSC treatment. Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks of standard regular immunosuppressive agents plus placebo. UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After UC-MSC transfusion, patients are followed up at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and the evaluation of liver function recovery was performed."

                              "Introduction\n\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common and devastating injury among young athletes, and re-injury poses significant threats to both successful return to play and long term outcomes. Graft healing during ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a slow biologic process, that involves graft incorporation into bone tunnel sites, as well as intra-articular graft remodeling . The intra-articular graft remodeling process is known as ligamentization, and occurs in three phases after ACLR. The first phase of early healing occurs between 0 and three months, the second phase occurs between 6 months and one year, and the final phase of maturation occurs after 1 year when the graft appears very similar to the native ACL. The studies that defined these time points biopsied human bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) ACL autografts at different postoperative points, and described changes occurring over time in regards to vascularization, cellular aspects, and appearance of the extracellular matrix in comparison to control ACLs . Unlike animal models which display a necrotic stage, grafts in human models undergo an early vascular invasion, associated with fibroblasts that are converted to a hyper-cellular matrix with only focalized areas of necrosis . This process occurs as early as 3 weeks postoperatively, and increases over time as areas similar to the native patellar tendon with mature collagen and metabolically quiescent cells decrease . This process is the limiting factor in graft healing for bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) grafts, as osteointegration occurs earlier .\n\nThe processes of osteointegration and ligamentization are responses to the new intrasynovial milieu and physical forces that the new graft is exposed to. During these healing and restructuring processes, failure load and stiffness of grafts decreases by up to 24% at 7 weeks, before strengthening to their potential . This contributes to the long recovery period for ACLR, and the risk of re-rupture during this period. Advances in biologic adjuncts to accelerate and improve this healing process would have a significant impact on the management of ACL injuries.\n\nRecently, biologic preparations of various growth factors have been developed to safely and effectively treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including tendinopathies and arthritis . Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) consists of undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells that are concentrated and applied to the injury site . Previous studies have demonstrated this treatment to offer the pluripotent potential of the cells to impact healing, regeneration, biomechanical strength, and reducing bone-tunnel enlargement . Investigators have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell reinforced grafts had a significantly higher failure load and stiffness as early as 8 week post-operation in a rabbit model, suggesting an added benefit of advanced healing . Using BMSCs can offer a novel method to enhance tendon graft osteointegration. While there have been numerous laboratory studies researching the effect of mesenchymal stem cells, there lacks evidence in translation to the clinical setting. Silva et al performed a study where they injected bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) into patellar tendon grafts to examine for increased graft-to-bone tunnel integration. They did not find a significant difference of tunnel integration on MRI imaging, but they did not examine the intra-articular portions for the effect on the ligamentization process, nor did they examine the effect on clinical examination and patient reported outcomes .\n\nQuantitative MRI is a non-invasive method to interrogate tissue properties and evaluate the biochemical composition of tissues. The T2* sequence gives information regarding tissue graft volume, water content, fiber alignment, and tissue density. Median grayscale values (a measure to determine tissue quality)can also be correlated to maximum failure load, yield load, and linear stiffness of grafts in a porcine model. Increases in MRI signals in ACL grafts have been found to be time dependent, becoming well established by three months, particularly at the distal intra-articular portion near the tibial tunnel . These changes have not been shown previously to be predictive of graft failure, but Investigators have recently also confirmed that normalized T2* signal intensity values of ACL grafts have significant correlation with knee instability related to ligamentization and tunnel healing.\n\nA recent study examined intra-articular graft maturation after platelet-rich plasma gel (PRPG) application, with MRI at month intervals from 3-12 months postoperatively. The intra-articular segment was divided in a proximal, middle, and distal segment, on a scale from 0-3 ranging from completely homogenous to severely heterogeneous. The mean time to obtain completely homogenous bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) graft was 109 days for the PRPG group, and 363 for the control group 8.\n\nWe propose using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T2* mapping to investigate if BMAC treatment at time of ACL reconstruction can accelerate the graft maturation and healing process. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft evaluating the T2* weighted MRI changes of the graft at 3 and 9 months after surgical reconstruction. Additionally, we will obtain patient-reported outcome measures from this cohort to evaluate if BMAC treatment imparts a clinically-significant effect on ACL reconstruction.\n\nStudy Rationale\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of biologic augmentation of ACL reconstruction with BMSCs as measured by magnetic resonance imaging to detect graft healing and integration. Secondary endpoints will include validated patient reported outcome measures, as well as functional outcome using objective examination findings.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe hypotheses of this study are that there will be improved graft healing and integration at three and nine months as measured by decreased signal intensity and heterogeneity on T2* MRI following administration of BMAC during ACL reconstruction compared to the control group. Additionally, patient reported outcomes and physical examination findings will be significantly improved at an earlier time in those who receive the BMAC treatment to their allograft compared to the control group.\n\nStudy Plan\n\nThis study will be a prospective randomized trial of patients undergoing arthroscopic reconstruction of full thickness anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. All patients who sign consent and undergo full thickness ACL reconstruction will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment will continue until 32 patients, 16 in each group, are enrolled. Follow-up will take place at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 24 months."

                              "mRNA profiling of urinary cells is fast evolving as a non-invasive substitute for invasive biopsy procedures employed for predicting renal allograft outcomes. This technique has been successfully used to develop biomarkers of acute rejection, but has not been evaluated for the diagnosis of allograft fibrosis.\n\nThe progressive scarring process of an allograft, called chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), remains the chief cause of kidney transplant failure. We have shown by immunohistochemistry that epithelial changes suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in early protocol biopsies predict the progression of CAN during the first year post-transplantation. Our preliminary results suggest that the urinary cell mRNA profile is altered in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with CAN.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate urine from KTRs during the first year post-transplantation to assess whether mRNA levels of genes involved in EMT/fibrogenesis can diagnose and predict CAN, and identify patients at risk of chronic allograft dysfunction.\n\nThe scientific underpinnings for our hypotheses are provided by (a) data showing that urinary cell mRNAs predict pathological changes (i.e., acute rejection) in renal allografts; and (b) our previous studies suggesting that CAN is characterized by altered urinary cell mRNA levels.\n\nOur specific aims are to (1) investigate whether the levels of 21 mRNAs encoding genes involved in EMT/fibrogenesis and the alloimmune response are a sensitive and specific non-invasive diagnostic test for CAN in renal allografts; (2) determine whether mRNA profiles of sequential urine specimens can predict the development of CAN during the first year post-transplantation; and (3) determine whether mRNA profiles of sequential urine specimens predict the subsequent development of graft dysfunction as assessed by estimated GFR at 12, 24 and 36 months after transplantation.\n\nEligible patients will be consecutive KTRs from Necker Hospital during one year (n\u2248180). Urine samples will be collected at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-transplantation, and 21 mRNAs involved in EMT/fibrogenesis and the alloimmune response will be quantified by PCR. Allograft fibrosis will be quantified by image analysis, developed in our unit. Urinary cell mRNA profiles will be correlated with data from protocol biopsies (3 months and 1 year) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 1 and 3 years. Diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of mRNA levels will be determined.\n\nThe identification of molecular markers of CAN may allow for early diagnosis of CAN (before the onset of fixed renal injury) and thus the development of specific therapeutic interventions."

However, CNI toxicity leads to significant morbidity. Moreover, CNIs cannot prevent long-term allograft injury.\n\nMesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) have potent immunomodulatory properties, which may promote allograft tolerance and ameliorate toxicity of high-dose CNI. The MYSTEP1 trial aims to investigate safety and feasibility of donor-derived MSCs in pLT.\n\nMethods/Design: 7 to 10 children undergoing living-donor pLT will be included in this open-label, prospective pilot trial. A dose of 1 \u00d7 106 MSCs/kg body weight will be given at two time points: first by intraportal infusion intraoperatively and second by intravenous infusion on postoperative day 2. In addition, participants will receive standard immunosuppressive treatment. Our primary objective is to assess the safety of intraportal and intravenous MSC infusion in pLT recipients. Our secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of MSC treatment as measured by the individual need for immunosuppression and the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection. We will perform detailed immune monitoring to investigate immunomodulatory effects.\n\nDiscussion: Our study will provide information on the safety of donor-derived MSCs in pediatric living-donor liver transplantation and their effect on immunomodulation and graft survival."

                              "Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term survival of transplanted kidneys has not improved accordingly in the last decades. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for many years, due to their efficacy in preventing acute rejection. However, CNI have nephrotoxic side effects that can directly contribute to renal dysfunction and compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently there is a strong interest in immunosuppressive (IS) regimens that maintain efficacy for the prevention of acute rejection, whilst reducing nephrotoxicity.\n\nIn this perspective the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with a mTor inhibitor (Everolimus (Certican\u00ae)) might be an optimal strategy to facilitate CNI (tacrolimus) withdrawal. MSCs have IS properties and roles in tissue repair and everolimus is a proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects. In experimental studies the combination of mTor inhibitor and MSCs was shown to attenuate alloimmune responses and to promote allograft tolerance.\n\nIn total 70 de novo renal recipients, 18-75 years of ages will be recruited from the transplant clinics of the LUMC. Thirty five of these patients will be included in the Certican/ and MSC group and 35 patients in the Certican/ standard dose tacrolimus group. Patients of the MSC treated groups will receive two doses of autologous BM derived MSCs IV, 7 days apart, 6 and 7 weeks after transplantation in combination with Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.). At the time of the second MSC infusion tacrolimus will be withdrawn in 2 weeks (after 1 week dose of tacrolimus will be halved, after 2 weeks stopped). Patients in the control group will receive Certican\u00ae (1.5 mg b.i.d.) and standard dose tacrolimus (through levels 6-8 ng/ml after 6 weeks).\n\nPrimary goal is evaluate whether concentration-controlled Certican\u00ae with MSCs compared to Certican\u00ae with standard tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients reduces fibrosis by quantitative Sirius Red scoring."

Following centrifugation, three layers are separated in the tube: cellular plasma at the top, platelet rich fibrin (PRF) clot in the middle and red blood cells at the bottom of the tube. The PRF clot is separated by a sterile pincette.\n\nThe patients in the test group receives BFPSCs loaded on FDBA with PRF for posterior mandible augmentation and the control group receives combination of PRF and FDBA (lacking any cells). The BFPSCs+FDBA+PRF in the test group and FDBA+PRF in the control group are placed in the gap between the block graft and recipient site. The results will be evaluated by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in 6 months and microscopic evaluation of the biopsies by hematoxylin and eosine staining during implant placement."

                              "Symptomatic arthritic conditions of the foot and ankle including osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies and others can be painful and disabling conditions that lead to a reduced quality of life. Major symptoms include pain, stiffness, swelling, and difficulty walking. Many patients may be initially treatable with non-invasive measures such as analgesics, ankle-foot orthosis, physical therapy and medications such as steroids; however, over time, surgery becomes necessary to improve quality of life and maintain function. Arthrodesis is a well-known procedure that can reduce pain and result in a foot/ankle that can withstand an active lifestyle.\n\nBone graft is used to stimulate new bone formation at the operative site by providing osteogenic cells with osteoinductive factors with an osteoconductive matrix. Although autologous bone is often used as the structural graft material for fusion procedures, donor site morbidity (e.g., pain, infection, and fracture), limited supply, and inconsistent osteogenic activity continue to be associated problems. The quality of an autograft is dependent upon the age and medical condition of the patient, as well as the number of viable mesenchymal and osteoprogenitor stem cells that are present in the specimen. This tissue is harvested during the surgical procedure; the process can prolong morbidity at the harvest site. The ideal bone graft would offer osteogenic cells, osteoinductive factors, and an osteoconductive matrix with a consistent supply of viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs)-but without the morbidity of autograft.\n\nDue to the limitations associated with autograft, researchers are pursuing the use of bone-graft substitutes to promote arthrodesis. Bone-graft substitutes now being used by surgeons include ceramic synthetics, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), demineralized bone matrices (DBMs) and other allografts; these may be used alone or in combination. Allografts available as substitutes for autograft offer some of the benefits of autograft without its limitations-but do not contain viable MSCs and OPCs.\n\nTrinity Evolution is an allogeneic cancellous bone matrix containing demineralized cortical bone (DCB) as well as viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem cells. Adult mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells, such as those in Trinity Evolution, are the precursor cells that differentiate into osteoblasts-the cells responsible for bone growth and repair.\n\nTrinity Evolution provides the required osteoconduction, osteogenesis, and osteoinductivity necessary for successful bone grafting. It offers viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem cells and demineralized cortical bone-all in a single product. Data from preclinical studies with Trinity Evolution have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo safety and effectiveness. Trinity Evolution is a \"minimally manipulated\" tissue that is considered an allograft, and as such, is labeled for bone repair for all orthopedic and podiatric indications where autograft is used. In this study, Trinity Evolution will be used as a substitute for autograft and/or standard allograft in the following arthrodesis procedures: tibiotalar, subtalar, calcaneocuboid, talonavicular, double fusions (i.e. calcaneocuboid and talonavicular), and triple fusions (i.e. subtalar, calcaneocuboid, and talonavicular)."

Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group. Kidneys from the same donor of DCD will be random allocated to intervention group and control group. In intervention group the investigators will collect SVF from recipients with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of DCD kidney transplantation during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. The investigators will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in DCD kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of autologous SVF derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival, improving allograft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, the investigators will assess the percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis within one week), and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities."

                              "Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the main cause of long term kidney transplant failure. Its main histological determinant is interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, but mechanisms of these changes are not completely elucidated and seem to be multifactorial. It seems that these histological changes develop as a consequence of immunological and non-immunological mechanisms. Study from Nankivell and al. defined two phases of CAN, early, attributed to immunological mechanisms; acute rejection, persistent subclinical rejection and ischemic- reperfusion injury, and late injury, characterized with progressive arteriolar hyalinosis, glomerulosclerosis andInterstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA), which was attributed in part to calcineurin inhibitor use and in part to ongoing immunologic injury.\n\nIn vitro studies and animal studies have shown epithelial mesenchimal transition as one of possible mechanisms and early markers of subsequent IF/TA. EMT is defined as process where completely differentiated epithelial cells undergo transition into fibroblast phenotype cells.\n\nIt is known that on molecular level RAAS has crucial role in development of progressive renal injury and fibrosis. Role of angiotensin II in progression of chronic kidney injury is established and well known. It mediates kidney injury by increasing intraglomerular capillary pressure leading to ultrafiltration of plasma proteins and by promoting cell growth and fibroproliferative effects.\n\nIt is hypothesized that aldosterone as a component of RAAS may also have direct role in proinflammatory and profibrotic mechanisms of initiation and progression of kidney injury. Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced in adrenal cortex zona glomerulosa and has crucial role as a regulator of extracellular fluid volume and sodium and potassium balance.\n\nIt has been shown in the rat models that aldosterone activates mTOR kinase, which promotes cell proliferation and contributes in early phases of injury healing. However, a prolonged activation of mTOR seems to promote development of interstitial fibrosis.\n\nAlthough the molecular pathways of aldosterone-mediated renal injury have not yet been fully elucidated, aldosterone may directly contribute to the final common pathway of renal fibrosis. In vitro studies have shown that aldosterone significantly increases TGF beta and fibronectin production by mesangial cells in culture and that this event is abolished by the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone. Randomized studies have shown beneficial role of blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors in heart failure. Also studies have shown beneficial role of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with nonselective antagonist spironolactone in reducing albuminuria in both diabetic and non diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) and antiproteinuric effect of a selective aldosterone inhibitor, eplerenone in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. Role of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in kidney transplant recipients has not been extensively evaluated so far.\n\nIn this study we hypothesized that use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, spironolactone, may contribute to slower progression of chronic histological changes in renal allografts."

                              "A total of 60 patients will be recruited from Scott Medical Health Center in Pittsburgh, PA. Inclusion criteria for the study are knee OA patients who are eligible for HAM and HUMCWJ therapy of their knee, no previous HAM or HUMCWJ therapy, between the ages of 50-85, independently residing in the community, no previously diagnosed cognitive decline or mental illness, and not taking pain medication more than once per week for a condition other than knee OA. Recruitment will be done in two parts as participants will self-select to participate in one of two study groups. All participants who elect to have the procedure done at the initial consultation, meet inclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 1. Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection. The T1 and T2 data collections will use the same data collection procedures and questionnaires."

The investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation. The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae, Astellas Pharma), and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will receive basiliximab (Simulect\u00ae, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.\n\nUp to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30 days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a 2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90 days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.\n\nThe study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials."

In this study, we explored the hypothesis that osteoarthritic cartilage matrix can promote chondrogenesis of MSCs. Cartilage matrix was harvested from the health-like parts of osteoarthritic cartilage tissue. Cartilage fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Histological analysis showed a round and elongated cell appearance with positive Alcian blue staining of cartilage matrix formation in the constructs. However, the cells in fibrin glue only were condensed like MSCs in pellet culture. Immunohistochemical staining was abundantly positive for type II collagen in neo-cartilage regions of cartilage fragment-fibrin glue-MSC constructs, while the constructs without cartilage fragments were negative in staining for type II collagen. The gene expressions of type II collagen in the constructs with 60 mg fragments were significantly elevated after 4 weeks of implantation. Conversely, constructs without cartilage fragments failed to express type II collagen, which indicated that MSCs could not differentiate into a chondrogenic lineage. In conclusion, we demonstrated the effects of osteoarthritic cartilage matrix in promoting chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. This was a favorable method without exogenous growth factors induction."

                              "This study is a prospective cohort clinical study, of tissue grafts containing nucleated adult derived autologous or allograft mesenchymal stem cells delivered via intra-discal or intra-facet injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to either lumbar degenerative disk disease or degenerative facet disease at one to five lumbar levels from L1 to S1 in patients who have been unresponsive to conservative therapy. A second cohort evaluating the development of adjacent segment disease in the lumbar disk and facet joints after nucleated adult mesenchymal stem cells are delivered via intra-discal or intra-facet injections during surgical treatment of adjacent levels for degenerative pathology in the spine. Traditionally, treatment of degenerative spinal conditions has focused on the reconstruction of damaged tissues within the motion segments of the spine. However, biologic treatment of degenerated spinal components should address the etiology of the disease process as opposed to reacting to symptomatology. Strategies to induce a reparative response within the disk and facet joint focus on rebuilding the chondrocyte population and inducing their production of healthy biomechanical extracellular matrix.. Current models to induce a reparative response include; injection of proteins to stimulate proteoglycan production or inhibit the inflammatory response; transfer of genetic material to cells within the dammed structures; engineering of newly formed tissues ex-vivo for implantation; and finally repopulation of the damaged tissues with cells that can repair the injured structures. Subjects who meet strict inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study for injection of allograft or autologous tissue grafting that includes mesenchymal stem cells into their degenerative lumbar spine and followed for a minimum of 2 years for efficacy and adverse events. This is a prospective clinical study cohort comparing allograft to autograft cellular tissue graft injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to either lumbar degenerative disk disease or degenerative facet disease at one to five lumbar levels from L1 to S1 in patients who have been unresponsive to conservative therapy for at least 3 months.Pre-treatment imaging criteria including Pfirmann Lumbar disk Scores and/or Fujiwara Facet Joint Scores will be noted during the screening visits. After the screening and treatment visits, each subject will be evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and again at 3, 6, 12, 24 months after injection.\n\nMRI scanning will be performed at the 6 month post-procedure visit and Pfirmann or Fujiwara Scores will be calculated along with notation of adjacent level disease, epidural pathology (i.e. new disk herniations), or new imaging findings. Patients will be given informed consent to participate the individual treatment they are to receive. This informed consent will follow US FDA guidelines detailed in ICH E6 Section 4.8 of the US Department of Health and Human Services Center for Drug/Biologics Evaluation and Research. At completion of enrollment patients will have surgical sterile preparation and draping. All JCAHO Surgical Care Improvement Project protocols including pre-operative antibiotics will be adhered to. The disk or facet joint of interest will be verified by fluoroscopy and will be sterilely cannulated with an 21 to 11G needle based on anatomic requirements. At this point injection of FDA approved allograft or autograft mesenchymal stem cells within a demineralized bone matrix or hyalouronic acid carrier respectively will be injected in to the facet joint or disk space. Needle will be removed and sterile dressing will be placed. Patients will be placed in a post operative brace for stabilization of the index level to aid in healing. Patients will be discharged home once standard outpatient discharge criteria are met per JCAHO guidelines. Follow up periods will be adhered to as noted above. Patient safety will be strictly monitored in the pre-procedure, peri-procedure, and post-procedure periods for a minimum of 2 years. All patients will be assigned to a follow up surgeon at specific follow up periods and no patients will be denied any care during that period. Physical examination will be documented at each visit. Additionally, scheduled imaging studies will be performed throughout the study period to follow safety. Patients will be followed by their surgical investigator, who will be responsible for diagnosis and management of any complications or adverse events. Development of additional non-spinal disease processes will also be documented to follow any trends that occur including any new related or un-related diseases. Safety of patient confidentiality is an additional study related risk, which will be optimized to the fullest by adhering to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as defined by the US FDA will be reported immediately to the IRB for evaluation. A SAE is classified as an adverse event that results in hospital admission or hospital stay, or alteration of the body in a permanent way. Surgeon investigators will provide pre-operative, peri-operative, and post-operative care for all subjects.\n\nPre-operative, peri-operative, and post operative data will be collected. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 2 years within the US or Canada with a study investigator for data collection at 2 weeks (\u00b11 wk), 6 weeks (\u00b12 wks), and 3 months (\u00b12 wks), 6 months (\u00b11 mo), 9 months (\u00b1 1.5 months), 12 months (\u00b12 mos), and 24 months (\u00b12 mos). Data may be entered as at additional time points as needed. Re-admission, re-injection, and additional hospital/outpatient events will be collected including possible additional surgical procedures. Data will be managed by the investigator or their designee in a computerized database accessible only by research staff with original information kept with the patient medical record in the hospital or follow up sub-investigator office. Comparative statistical analysis will be performed prior to any publication to validate data and conclusions. Study staff and the Principle Investigator (PI) agree to conduct the study(ies) in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s) and will only make changes in a protocol after notifying the sponsor, except when necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects. The PI agrees to personally conduct or supervise the described investigation(s). The PI agrees to inform any patients, or any persons used as controls, when drugs or devices are being used for investigational purposes and the PI will ensure that the requirements relating to obtaining informed consent in US 21 CFR Part 50 and institutional review board (IRB) review and approval in US 21 CFR Part 56 are met. The PI agrees to report to the sponsor adverse experiences that occur in the course of the investigation(s) in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.64. The PI understands the potential risks and side effects of all treatments, investigational and standard of care. The PI agrees to ensure that all associates, colleagues, and employees assisting in the conduct of the study(ies) are informed about their obligations in meeting the above commitments. The PI agrees to maintain adequate and accurate records in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.62 and to make those records available for inspection in accordance with US 21 CFR 312.68 if the study is applied and accepted for US FDA review. The PI will ensure that the IRB complies with the requirements of US 21 CFR Part 56 will be responsible for the initial and continuing review and approval of the clinical investigation. The PI also agrees to promptly report to the IRB all changes in the research activity and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others. Additionally, the PI will not make any changes in the research without IRB approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects. The PI agrees to comply with all other requirements regarding the obligations of clinical investigators and all other pertinent requirements in US 21 CFR Part 312. Medical Ethics are of primary importance during a study of that exposes humans to a new treatment. The scientific merit of the study protocol, potential social value of the research, skill and experience of the investigators, and potential financial exploitation of the study subjects are all of paramount concern. Thus, in addition to abiding by the US FDA Quality Assurance Policy (Form 1572), the World Health Organization's \"Declaration of Helsinki\" involving the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects will be abided by throughout the trial. Finally, as this study involves subjects that reside within the United States, the investigators in this trial will also abide by Title 45 Part 46 of the Code of [US] Federal Regulations, Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46)."

The MSCs manufactured for this study are a subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors. These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can differentiate into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to contributing directly to repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate the body's own cells to regenerate.\n\nThough an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a similar effect in skin rejuvenation.\n\nIn the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant cutaneous photodamage."

                              "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure in which progenitor cells capable of reconstituting normal bone marrow function are administered to a patient. This procedure has been used to treat adults and children with life-threatening hematological malignancies and congenital immunodeficiency disorders.\nIn HSCT, therapeutic goal is an elimination of disease and enrichment of regenerating capacity to achieve engraftments resulting in continued generation of functional blood elements from the engrafted living cells. Transplantation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cells originating either from adult bone marrow or from peripheral blood often leads to graft-versus host-disease (GvHD), opportunistic infections and graft failure after transplantation.\nIn HSCT, MSC have been used as a therapy for GvHD and other complications. The aim of MSC infusions in HSCT is to use the cells' immunomodulatory effects to promote engraftment and to reduce the immunological reactions giving rise to GvHD.\nThere is a growing interest in co-transplantation of MSC and HSC to improve the donor outcome in the unrelated HSCT condition."
