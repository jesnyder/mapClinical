Despite the ability of current immunosuppressive agents to reduce the incidence of acute rejection, the rate of acute rejection reaches to 20-50% after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the long-term toxicity associated with current regimens for liver transplant recipients now is increasingly being perceived as an unmet clinical need. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appeared to be effective in regulating the invoked immune response in setting such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity, and have been used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s). Here, we evaluate umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) as an alternative immunosuppressive agents for liver transplanted patients, and examine if UC-MSC could improve the recovery of liver function."

However, in contrast, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity leads to significant morbidity and impairs quality of life for recipients. Moreover, CNI cannot prevent long-term allograft inflammation and fibrosis.\n\nMesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) have potent immunomodulatory properties potentially promoting allograft tolerance and ameliorating toxicity of exposure to high dose CNI. Previous trials for non-solid organ transplant indications have shown an excellent safety profile of intravenous MSC application. The MYSTEP1 trial aims to investigate safety and benefits portal and intravenous MSC infusion in pediatric LT."

The investigators further hypothesize that the underlying fibrotic mechanism is mediated by pathophysiologic processes that promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (mediated by TGF- \u0192\u00d2) and that early therapeutic intervention may reverse this process (mediated by BMP-7)4.\n\nTo address these hypotheses the investigators propose the following clinical and mechanistic aims:\n\nThe investigators will test the hypothesis that switching from Tac to SRL in a Tac based triple therapy regimen with MMF and steroids in living and or deceased donor renal transplant recipients leads to improvement in allograft structure and function at 2 years post-transplantation.\n\nThe investigators will test this hypothesis in an open label controlled trial where stable renal allograft recipients on Tac, MMF, prednisone maintenance immunosuppression will undergo renal biopsy at 3-4 months post-transplantation and will be randomized to either a) Remain on Tac, MMF and prednisone (CNI-maintenance) or b) switch the Tac to SRL and continue MMF and prednisone.

                              "Chronic allograft nephropathy is one of dominant causes of long term kidney transplant failure. Its main histological determinant is interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Mechanisms of these changes are multifactorial and are not completely elucidated. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) might be one of the mechanisms. On molecular level role of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has been recognized. Recently, mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone has been proposed as a possible direct contributor to the progression of renal injury and fibrosis, beside his well known role as a regulator of extracellular fluid volume and sodium and potassium balance. In this study the investigators will determine the impact of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use on progression of chronic scores in transplanted kidney over one year. The investigators hypothesis is that spironolactone use in kidney transplant patients will slow down progression of chronic histological changes- interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyalinosis."

However, there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients receive induction therapy and immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) infusion compared to saline-only infusion in reducing the immune suppression necessary to achieve optimal renal function in renal transplant recipients. All participants will receive routine care: basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids."

Cartilage fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice.\n\nMoreover, the investigators will collect the discard cartilage to develop an acellular cartilage ECM-derived scaffold in the joint replacement surgery. In addition, the investigators will harvest the redundant bone marrow from drilling or useless synovium during the surgery to separate the mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, these mesenchymal stem cells will be transfected with hTERT for rejuvenation and then will be labeled with fluorescent dye PKH26 for application of animal study. To sum up, the investigators plan to use human, natural, and discard materials from the joint replacement surgery to develop appropriate allograft for cartilage repair and hope that one day this ideal would be apply in clinical."

                              "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs are the main problems.\n\nThere are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called \"stem cells\". Stem cells can be differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.\n\nIn this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis, ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies."

                              "Guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures have significantly evolved over the last 20 years. Significant advances have been made with various barrier membranes with or without the use of bone grafts and other materials. Some of the main limitations of non-resorbable barriers included cytotoxicity and need for removal, which can adversely affect the regenerated bone volume. Similar GBR success has been documented extensively with cell occlusive resorbable barriers membranes. Recently, the investigators demonstrated supracrestal bone regeneration in guided tissue regeneration procedures in humans with the use of novel perforated barrier membrane (MPM). The perforation allows mesenchymal stem cells and other progenitor cells present in the gingival tissues to migrate into the osseous defect and contribute to the osseous regeneration potential.\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the GBR potential of MPM in alveolar ridge defects, relative to a similar occlusive barrier. Ten non-smoking patients that need localized alveolar ridge augmentation prior to implant placement will be included into the study. Patients will be divided into two groups, as follows: occlusive bovine collagen membrane (OM control group, 5 patients) and modified bovine perforated collagen membrane (MPM test group, 5 patients). All sites will be grafted with mineralized cortical bone allograft and when needed cortical bone pins will be use for site stability. A Cone Bean (CT) will be obtained prior to surgery and 6-8 months post treatment from which volumetric width changes will be quantify. A bone biopsy will be obtained at the time of implant placement (~6-8 months) to determine residual graft particles and new bone formation. Dimensional width changes will be assess at 6-8 months during re-entry for implant placement. Soft tissue healing will be assessed at 2, 4, 8, 16 weeks and 6 months.\n\nThis study can potentially impact current bone augmentation techniques and may lead to the modification of existing commercial membranes that will enhance site development prior to implant placement. The contribution of progenitor cells to the osseous defect might lead to greater bone formation and possible faster wound healing."
