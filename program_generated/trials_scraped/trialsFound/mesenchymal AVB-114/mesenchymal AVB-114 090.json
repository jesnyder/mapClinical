                              "AVB-114 is an investigational therapy which offers a new therapeutic approach to treating this unmet medical need. The drug product is a mesenchymal cell substrate system comprised of autologous mesenchymal cells incubated with a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable substrate. The drug substance is expanded, pure mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which are known to modulate local inflammation and orchestrate tissue healing. By incubating cells with a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable substrate designed for anal fistula geometry, cells are locally delivered into the fistula tract to promote healing."

                              "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nProvision of signed and dated ICF.\nAbility and willingness to comply with study protocol and study requirements for the duration of the study.\nMale or female, 18-70 years of age\nSubjects with CD diagnosed at least 6 months prior to screening visit.\nSubjects with a single fistula tract with one internal opening and one external opening, including a previously performed conversion of a branching fistula tract to a single fistula tract where the branching occurred outside the sphincter complex.\nSubjects whose perianal fistula(s) were previously treated with either biologic or conventional therapy whose fistula has demonstrated a failed response or who have documented medication intolerance.\nWomen of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have negative serum pregnancy test at screening (sensitive to 25 IU human chorionic gonadotropin). WCBP participating in this study must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the entire duration of the study. Males who have sexual partners that are women of childbearing potential must be willing to use a barrier method for contraception for the duration of study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nClinically significant medical conditions within the six months before screening that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the safety of the subject with study participation and/or the ability of the subject to follow study protocol.\nEvidence of hepatitis B, C, or HIV or subjects with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies.\nParticipation in an investigational drug study (within 30 days of last administration from screening visit) or investigational medical device study (within 1 year of implant from screening visit) where investigational treatment (drug or device) is placed in rectum, vagina, or near fistula location, or that may potentially interact with study treatment.\nHistory (within previous 5 years of screening visit) of invasive cancer including melanoma (with the exception of localized skin cancers).\nSubjects pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or are breast feeding.\nSubjects with contraindications to Magnetic Resonance (MR) evaluations and/or to MR contrast.\nHistory of clinically significant fat-directed autoimmunity.\nConcomitant recto-vaginal fistula\nConcomitant ileal anal pouch perineal fistulas.\nActive, unresolved infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\nAny major surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (including one or more segments of the colon or terminal ileum) within 3 months prior to screening visit. Presence of stoma is not exclusionary.\nSubjects who had a definitive surgical procedure for the target fistula or a perianal procedure that resulted in a large soft tissue defect within 6 months prior to screening visit.\nA compromised abdominal region due to a previous cool sculpting procedure, abdominal radiation, chemotherapy, recent tattoos, local infection, or other reasons that may compromise the adipose tissue for study use.\nSubjects previously treated with Cx601/Alofisel or other allogeneic or autologous stem-cell therapy within the past 6 months.\nContraindications to the anesthetic procedure (local and general) or to the adipose tissue collection procedure.\n\nSubjects with one or more of the following fistula types or anatomic presentations:\n\nHorseshoe fistulas\nFistulas that do not have an opening inside the anal canal or low rectum\nBlind ending sinus tracts (no external opening)\nBranching fistulas that involve or are near the sphincter complex and cannot be converted to single tracts without risk to injury to the sphincter complex\n>1 internal opening\nModerate or severe proctitis\nSevere rectal mucosal fibrosis surrounding the internal opening preventing the securing of the fistula plug cap.\nAny anatomical limitation to successfully securing the fistula plug cap\nEvidence by colonoscopy of moderately or greater active luminal CD.\nSubject with ongoing systemic or rectal steroids for CD in the last 2 weeks prior to screening and baseline study visits.\nHistory of, or concurrent high-grade dysplasia, adenocarcinoma, and carcinoma in situ on colonoscopy within 5 years of screening visit.\nSubjects with renal insufficiency (creatinine value > 1.8 mg/dL, eGFR < 44, or patient undergoing dialysis).\nSubjects with a hemoglobin less than 8 gm/dL.\nSubjects with serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) > 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).\nSubjects with undrained peri-anal sepsis.\nSubjects with known coagulopathy (abnormal INR) or thrombocytopenia as indicated by a platelet count < 75,000.\nSubjects with history of substance abuse (drug or alcohol) that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol and study requirements."
