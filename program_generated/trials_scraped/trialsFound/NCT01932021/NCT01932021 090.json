The objective also covers the measurement of changes in the appearance of the wound, with an expected decrease of relative areas of fibrin and necrosis. The percentage of wound healing and wound area was measured at each visit, a curve will be performed for each patient to assess the speed of healing and the appearance of the wound will be notified."
