A number of clinical trials are being conducted worldwide testing th efficacy of MSC, mainly isolated from bone marrow, for different conditions, such as Graft Versus host Disease, refractory Crohn's Disease, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, type I Diabetes Mellitus, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Usually, the route of administration of the cells in these studies is intravenous. Local injection of MSC for fistulizing Crohn's Disease has proven efficacious. Endoscopy is a routinary technique for the evaluation of gastrointestinal and colonic conditions. The purpose of our study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived MSC in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis."

Subject with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease will be treated with Cx601, suspension of eASCs, at a dose of 120 million cells administered by intralesional injection. The treatment of complex perianal fistulas by local application of eASCs intends to improve significantly the local conditions with very few inconveniences (ambulatory procedure) and minimal risk of possible complications (anal incontinence). Therefore, this is a new therapeutic resource that is expected to be safe and efficacious as well as is expected to improve the quality of life of the patients in this highly debilitating and chronic condition. This treatment would prevent one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would diminish recurrence of the fistula disease and would reduce drastically the significant disorders provoked by the standard fistula surgery in the patients. Indeed, patients can be discharged according to the \"One Day Surgical\" procedures (major ambulatory surgery)."
